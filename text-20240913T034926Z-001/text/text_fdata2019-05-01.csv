controls to curb inflation english pdf 168 kb global issues aligning monetary policy with the sdgs a slowdown in global economic activity coupled with largely benign inflationary pressures has triggered a shift towards easier monetary policy stances across many developed and developing economies figure 1 in march the united states federal reserve fed lowered its expectations from two interest rate hikes to none in 2019 and announced that it will begin to slow the pace of its balance sheet normalization in efforts to boost credit growth the european central bank ecb recently launched a new series of targeted longer term refinancing operations and delayed any increase in interest rates until at least 2020 meanwhile the people s bank of china further lowered the reserve requirement ratios for banks in early 2019 to improve domestic liquidity conditions given increased uncertainty over growth prospects and reduced inflationary pressures a few large developing economies including egypt india and nigeria have also reduced their key policy rates across most developing regions including africa and latin america inflationary pressures have recently eased in part reflecting more stable exchange rates and improved agricultural production nonetheless consumer price inflation remains high in many lower middle income and low income economies particularly in countries with restricted access to foreign exchange when the export earnings of a country are insufficient to finance its import needs economic decisions may be constrained by the availability of foreign exchange namely the foreign reserves of a central bank and other foreign financial inflows insufficient foreign exchange leaves a country exposed to exchange rate and income volatility and puts upward pressure on import costs often passing through to higher consumer price inflation a sound macroeconomic policy framework is essential to deliver stable and healthy economic growth and meet the objectives of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development macroeconomic policy tools can be used to reduce the impact of a shock and stabilize income levels and inflation policy tools also impact how income is distributed across individuals and across generations guide consumption and production decisions and influence the internal and external balance of an economy key policy instruments include taxes government borrowing and spending exchange rate setting interest rates and other monetary and credit rules a roadmap for the sustainable development goals sdgs often emphasises the role of the fiscal side of macroeconomic policy the role of monetary and exchange rate policies which are crucial for maintaining financial stability and external balance are often overlooked a stable macroeconomic environment reduces uncertainty and improves prospects for economic growth in both the short term and the medium term helping to promote sustained growth sdg 8 income stability also helps to reduce inequality sdg 10 as downturns in economic activity are often most acutely felt by those with limited savings and lower incomes these goals are closely allied to many other sdgs including reducing poverty sdg 1 and ending hunger sdg 2 new initiatives have also proposed that monetary policy can be further aligned with the sdgs for example by supporting progress towards a low carbon economy a group of central banks and supervisors have established the network for greening the financial system to enhance the role of the financial system in managing climate risks and mobilizing capital for green and low carbon investments proposals have also been put forward to introduce a low carbon bias in the asset composition of official reserves and collateral traditional monetary policy actions such as a rise in interest rates are transmitted to the real economy through credit exchange rate and asset price channels in countries with well developed financial sectors impacts on credit growth and balance sheets may affect corporate sector investment decisions housing investment and consumer spending on durable goods in countries with less developed financial markets the transmission of monetary policy to aggregate demand is generally less effective corporate investment in the formal sector may respond but the informal sector and household sector are less sensitive to interest rates partly because consumption expenditure is dominated by essential non durable goods the expenditure share of food items in the consumption basket underpinning the consumer price index cpi is much higher in low income countries than in developed countries figure 2 as such price stability depends heavily on food price inflation in many low income developing countries this sensitivity to food price inflation is complicated by a high dependency on food imports for example in sudan food including wheat and other staples accounted for 24 per cent of imports in 2018 despite the fact that agriculture accounts for about 30 per cent of gdp furthermore food items carry a weight of 52 per cent in the cpi basket sudan has been under severe foreign exchange constraints since 2011 owing to declining crude oil exports rising import demand and dwindling foreign capital inflows in 2018 the sudanese pound depreciated from 6 7 pounds per us dollar to 47 5 pounds per us dollar the sharp rise in import prices pushed consumer price inflation up to 72 per cent in december 2018 the resulting plunge in real incomes triggered widespread social protests the example of sudan illustrates a policy challenge common to economies that are faced with both a shortage of foreign exchange and high dependency on food imports as they aim to stabilize food prices interest rates may be used in conjunction with exchange rate policy although this usually relies on having some form of capital controls in place under a managed exchange rate regime the exchange rate can be used as a tool to offset global food price fluctuations this can help to preserve domestic price stability and also further progress towards development goals by safeguarding low income households which are particularly sensitive to food price inflation however for this to be sustainable when global food prices rise the monetary stance may need to be tightened to curb import demand for non essentials which may also hamper investments that the country desperately needs for economic growth and development in addition holding the exchange rate at an artificially high level leads to a loss of export competitiveness may encourage a dual exchange rate or black market activities depletes foreign reserves and may eventually culminate in a steep and sudden devaluation ultimately the root causes of foreign exchange shortage must be tackled through export sector development and agricultural development to reduce dependency on imported food developed economies north america federal reserve softens monetary stance following the federal open market committee s meeting in march the fed stressed that the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate and voting members delayed their expectations for the next interest rate rise until 2020 while wage growth has been steadily rising reflecting some tightness in the labour market with the unemployment rate standing at one of the lowest levels recorded in the last 40 50 years headline consumer price inflation hovers just below the 2 per cent target the change in the fed s message on monetary policy reflected a more pessimistic expectation on the economy following the increased financial volatility as observed by the end of 2018 the persistent trade tensions and the waning effects of fiscal stimuli inflation in the united states remains sensitive to oil price movements should oil prices continue to rise over the coming months this could push headline inflation above 2 per cent and potentially lead to a reassessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate japan consumer price inflation remains below target with consumer price inflation projected to be well below the 2 per cent target over the next two years the bank of japan has indicated its intention to continue with its quantitative and qualitative monetary easing qqe programme when the qqe programme was introduced in 2012 the central bank expected to achieve its inflation target by 2019 the inflation rate in march stood at just 0 5 per cent despite ongoing labour shortages which have contributed to the increasing number of business closures wage growth remains insufficient to generate inflationary pressures in february real wages declined by 1 1 per cent compared to last year europe subdued inflation on an upward trend inflation remains subdued in europe amid increasing upward wage pressure the euro area saw inflation rise from 0 2 per cent in 2016 to 1 5 per cent in 2017 and 1 7 per cent last year inflation is expected to remain steady this year as an easing in the upward pressure from energy prices is offset by increasing pressures on the domestic side employment has been increasing throughout the region with unemployment falling to the point where in some subregions there is a shortage of labour this is propelling stronger wage growth which in turn is supporting domestic demand as monetary policy is expected to remain more accommodative for a longer period than previously expected this will continue to support investment and the construction sector in various countries however overall economic activity has slowed across the region as a result of the disruption in auto production weaker confidence and softer external demand inflation is forecast to remain within the ecb s policy target of below but close to 2 per cent persistent labour shortages in countries that joined the european union since 2004 spurred strong growth in nominal wages in 2018 in early 2019 this trend continued threatening several economies with a wage price spiral in the czech republic headline inflation reached 2 7 per cent in february and contrary to global easing trend some central banks in the region may tighten monetary policy further this year economies in transition cis vat increase in the russian federation has inflationary impact in the commonwealth of independent states cis the russian federation experienced a lengthy period of disinflation from late 2015 to mid 2018 due mainly to ample harvests and a rebound of the rouble in early 2018 inflation slowed to an all time record low of 2 2 per cent far below the central bank s target of 4 per cent however inflation accelerated later in the year because of the sluggish harvest and depreciating currency reaching 4 3 per cent in december the increase in the vat rate in january 2019 further pushed inflation up to 5 2 per cent in february the contribution of the vat rise was nevertheless moderate and was mitigated by the strengthening of the rouble in the first quarter explained by the strong demand for the russian sovereign bonds and rouble purchases for tax payments by the export oriented companies since the central bank has already pre emptively increased its policy rate in late 2018 no further tightening of monetary policy is expected in 2019 the accelerated inflation has nonetheless undermined consumer spending as real incomes continue to contract for the fifth year in a row and was one of the factors behind the sharp growth slowdown in the first quarter in ukraine inflation in december stood at 9 8 per cent but gradually tapered to 8 4 per cent in march this year thanks to the stronger currency however the increases in minimum wage and pensions the planned rise in household natural gas tariffs and possible delays in receiving imf tranches may pose inflationary risks developing economies africa inflation remains a crucial macroeconomic challenge in some economies the recent monetary policy shifts in developed economies coupled with relatively subdued inflationary pressures have opened monetary policy space to support growth in several african countries since the beginning of the year six countries angola egypt gambia ghana malawi and nigeria have cut interest rates to support economic activity these decisions have been underpinned by lower inflationary risks greater exchange rate stability and higher levels of reserves however inflation rates in many of these countries remain elevated in other countries in the region inflation remains persistently high in zimbabwe the annual inflation rate peaked at 66 8 per cent in march the highest inflation rate since hyperinflation in 2008 as economic financial and liquidity conditions deteriorate further despite the introduction of a new transitional currency in february prices of staples including sugar cooking oil and rice have risen as much as 60 per cent squeezing already hard pressed consumers even higher inflationary pressures are likely to materialize in the near term due to a devastating el niño induced drought and torrential rains brought by cyclone idai zimbabwe plans to establish a monetary policy committee and set a benchmark interest rate as part of its plans to stabilize the economy in south sudan and sudan inflation hovered at 40 45 per cent during the first quarter of 2019 mainly as a result of the monetization of fiscal deficits to finance conflict related spending the concurrent loss of purchasing power has meant that many employees and business owners have been driven into poverty increased oil output and reduction in violence have contributed to disinflation in south sudan but extreme levels of acute food insecurity persist as well as risk of famine in sudan significant protests erupted in december over the rising costs of bread and fuel the social uprising intensified in recent months culminating in the removal of president omar al bashir from power east asia monetary policies likely to remain accommodative amid high external uncertainty amid subdued inflation and high uncertainty in the external environment monetary policy in most of the east asian economies is likely to remain accommodative in the outlook period the recent pausing of the monetary policy normalization process in the developed economies has also reduced capital outflow pressures for the region in early 2019 china further lowered the reserve requirement ratios for banks in an effort to improve domestic liquidity conditions following a series of rate hikes in 2018 indonesia and the philippines have kept interest rates unchanged this year given increased downside risks to growth in the republic of korea the central bank removed a reference to possible monetary policy tightening in the near term while simultaneously downgrading its growth and inflation projections for many east asian countries policymakers are facing an increasingly challenging task of supporting short term growth while reining in financial imbalances in china the easing of credit conditions may fuel a further rise in corporate debt increasing the risk of a sharp deleveraging process in the future in thailand and the republic of korea high household debt is increasingly being seen as a source of risk to financial stability in this environment central banks in the region are likely to adopt a cautious approach to any further monetary easing while utilizing macroprudential tools to target financial vulnerabilities in specific sectors of the economy south asia inflation is moderate in india but surging in the islamic republic of iran inflation rates across south asia are forecast to remain largely similar to 2018 india is expected to record a 4 7 per cent price increase slightly below the 5 year average of 4 9 per cent this opened some space for monetary policy loosening and interest rates were cut by 25 basis points in both february and april nevertheless as banks remain constrained by non performing loans and a large share of credit is provided by non bank institutions the monetary policy transmission remains weak in india the impact of the rate cuts on the economy and inflation will therefore be limited prices are forecast to grow faster in pakistan at an annual rate of 7 3 per cent in 2019 in the islamic republic of iran inflation is expected to exceed 20 per cent in the rest of the region prices are forecast to grow by around 4 per cent in 2019 during the 2018 2019 period food price inflation has been at an almost three decade low in india in march food prices increased by only 0 3 per cent on a year on year basis food price stabilisation is particularly important for the more than 10 per cent of the population who live in extreme poverty given that the household budgets of the poorest consist almost entirely of food expenditure in pakistan on the other hand food price inflation stood at 8 2 per cent in march 2019 combined with a slowing economy this could substantially hinder poverty reduction efforts the situation is slightly better in bangladesh with food prices increasing by 5 7 per cent meanwhile food price inflation in the iranian economy has reached over 70 per cent reflecting the impact of economic sanctions combined with high unemployment and a dire economic outlook for 2019 the poor are most severely impacted western asia decelerating consumer price inflation in western asia consumer price inflation is decelerating in most countries with the exception of syria where the economy faces considerable inflationary pressures linked to economic sanctions as a regional trend the price of food items is moderately declining due to stable international grain prices furthermore the weakening real estate sector pushed down prices of housing related items in several energy exporting countries of the region annual consumer price inflation in february stood at 0 9 per cent in bahrain 0 6 per cent in kuwait 0 2 per cent in oman 1 4 per cent in qatar 2 2 per cent in saudi arabia and 2 5 per cent in the united arab emirates the deflation in qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates reflects weak domestic demand expansion in those countries in 2019 the inflation rate in lebanon and jordan has also come down from the recent peak in july 2018 in february the inflation rate stood at 0 2 per cent in jordan and 3 1 per cent in lebanon although still high the inflation rate in turkey decelerated to 19 7 per cent in march from the recent peak of 25 2 per cent in november 2018 the inflation rate is forecast to decelerate further due to the waning impact of exchange rate pass through from the substantial depreciation of the turkish lira last year latin america and the caribbean argentina s government imposes price controls to contain inflation following a volatile financial environment during 2018 the recent monetary shifts by the fed and other major global central banks have been welcome news for the economies in latin america and the caribbean portfolio capital flows to the region rebounded in early 2019 pushing up the prices of local assets regional currencies including the brazilian real the chilean peso and the colombian peso stabilized after losing ground to the dollar in 2018 this has helped offset rising oil prices keeping inflationary pressures largely in check in most countries inflation rates were within the target range of monetary authorities during the first quarter of 2019 central banks thus have some room to maneuver should the economic outlook deteriorate the inflation situation is very different in the bolivarian republic of venezuela and argentina the former faces sky rocketing hyperinflation amid shortages of food and basic goods the monetization of large fiscal deficits and a rapid depreciation of the currency in the parallel market in argentina year on year inflation rose to 51 4 per cent in the first three months of 2019 as monetary tightening measures failed to halt upward price pressures in response the central bank reinforced the contractionary bias of monetary policy at the same time the government unveiled a new program of price controls temporarily freezing the prices of 60 essential products and public services including gas electricity and public transportation

comparative year the decrease was mainly due to lower all in sustaining costsng explained above partially offset by higher revenue based taxes resulting from increased sales revenue achieved in the first quarter of 2019 kumtor ground movements the company has successfully managed shifting ground conditions at kumtor during the entire history of the mine during the first quarter of 2019 kumtor carried out mining activities in cut back 19 in the vicinity of the mill building due to movement in the ground some cracking in the concrete foundation of the mill building was identified there was no impact observed in the grinding circuit and mill operations were not affected the company took a number of actions to stabilize the concrete mill foundations and mitigate further effects of the ground movement including shifting mining activities away from the immediate area relocating the boiler room where the most significant cracking was observed and implementing further de watering activities as a result movement of the mill foundations has ceased and remains stable the mill continues to operate at full production and kumtor maintains its 2019 production and cost guidance together with the assistance of external experts kumtor continues to review the ground conditions in the vicinity of the mill to ensure the safety and stability of the mill foundations and to determine what if any additional measures are necessary the company does not expect any material effect on kumtor s future production or reserves and resources as a result of such ground movements mount milligan mine the mount milligan mine is an open pit mine located in north central british columbia canada producing a gold and copper concentrate production at mount milligan is subject to a streaming arrangement the mount milligan streaming arrangement with royal gold inc and rgld gold ag collectively royal gold pursuant to which royal gold is entitled to purchase 35 of the gold produced and 18 75 of the copper production at the mount milligan mine for 435 per ounce of gold delivered and 15 of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered water update as previously disclosed starting in the fourth quarter of 2018 mount milligan reduced its milling throughput to properly manage its water balance during the winter season the limited milling production continued through the first quarter of 2019 on february 23 2019 the company announced that the british columbia environmental assessment office eao approved an amendment to mount milligan s environmental assessment certificate to permit access to additional sources of surface water and groundwater the company is now permitted to obtain water for use in mount milligan s milling operation from philip lake 1 rainbow creek and meadows creek until november 30 2021 at set rates as well as water from groundwater sources within a radius of six kilometres of the mount milligan mine for the life of the mine mount milligan has upgraded its water pumping infrastructure and commenced access to water from the newly permitted sources at the beginning of april 2019 as a result mount milligan slowly increased mount milligan s mill processing throughput as water levels increased in the mill s tailings storage facility the company expects that the additional water captured during the spring melt will be sufficient to allow mount milligan to return mill processing operations to full capacity 55 000 tonnes per day starting mid may and that mount milligan s mill throughput will average approximately 55 000 tonnes per day through the remainder of 2019 with respect to the updated long term water supply plan the company continues to work with relevant stakeholders to identify and evaluate water sources that will best be able to supply mount milligan s mill for the life of mine while meeting environmental and other parameters formal applications and government review is expected to commence later this year and will be the subject of discussion with regulators potentially affected indigenous groups local communities and other interested parties the company s expectation is that its updated long term water source or sources should be available after november 2021 for the entire life of mine see caution regarding forward looking information mount milligan operating results millions except as

centerra kgc and koc against the government of the kyrgyz republic and kyrgyzaltyn has been suspended until may 31 2019 during the suspension the parties will work towards completing the strategic agreement and the resolution of all outstanding matters affecting the kumtor project kyrgyz republic claims siets claims as previously disclosed on may 25 2016 the bishkek inter district court in the kyrgyz republic ruled against kumtor operating company koc centerra s wholly owned subsidiary on two claims made by the state inspectorate office for environmental and technical safety of the kyrgyz republic siets in relation to the placement of waste rock at the kumtor waste dumps and unrecorded wastes from kumtor s effluent and sewage treatment plants the inter district court awarded damages of 6 698 878 290 kyrgyz soms approximately 96 6 million at current exchange rates and 663 839 kyrgyz soms approximately 9 600 at current exchange rates respectively on june 1 2016 the inter district

approximately 2 3 million and 188 533 730 kyrgyz soms approximately 2 7 million respectively on march 27 2018 upon the application of siets the bishkek city court terminated each of the siets claims noted above however in april 2018 siets successfully appealed the decisions to terminate these claims and the claims have been returned to the court of first instance for further consideration despite this development the company expects these claims to be resolved in connection with the strategic agreement kyrgyz republic general prosecutor s office proceedings the company is and was subject to a number of other criminal proceedings commenced by the kyrgyz republic general prosecutor s office and other kyrgyz republic state agencies as described below criminal investigation into environmental matters kgc is also aware of an outstanding criminal investigation in the kyrgyz republic which concerns the same subject matter as the siets claims described above the company expects that this investigation will be terminated in connection with the strategic agreement land use claim as previously noted kgc had challenged the purported 2012 cancellation of its land use surface rights over the kumtor concession areas in the kyrgyz republic courts as well as in its arbitration claim described above on august 28 2017 the bishkek inter district court terminated the proceeding commenced by the gpo in respect of kumtor s land use rights over the kumtor concession area the company received new land use certificates on january 24 2019 kyrgyz state tax orders in august 2018 kgc commenced a claim in the kyrgyz courts refiled on september 26 2018 seeking to invalidate orders of the kyrgyz republic state tax service which reassessed taxes including sanctions and penalties owing from kgc for the period from 2016 to 2017 in the amount of 1 377 709 739 44 kyrgyz soms approximately 20 million primarily in relation to the alleged failure to pay taxes on high altitude premiums paid to employees at the kumtor mine site the kyrgyz court held a hearing in december 2018 and satisfied kgc s claim to invalidate the orders this court decision came into effect on january 10 2019 after the customary appeal period expired gpo review of kumtor project agreements on june 14 2016 according to reports in the kyrgyz republic the kyrgyz republic president instructed the gpo to investigate the legality of the agreements relating to the kumtor project which were entered into in 2003 2004 and 2009 the 2009 restated investment agreement governing the kumtor project which was entered into in 2009 superseded entirely the 2003 and 2004 agreements the 2009 restated investment agreement was negotiated with the kyrgyz republic government kyrgyzaltyn and their international advisers and approved by all relevant kyrgyz republic state authorities including the kyrgyz republic parliament and any disputes under the 2009 restated investment agreement are subject to resolution by international arbitration the company understands that this investigation has been closed with respect to certain individuals management assessment of outstanding kumtor matters as noted above the strategic agreement contained no admission on the part of centerra or its kyrgyz subsidiaries of i any environmental wrongdoing ii any non compliance with kyrgyz law or the kumtor project agreements or iii any pre existing obligation to make additional environmental or reclamation trust fund payments or environmental remediation efforts the company and kgc continue to dispute all of the allegations noted above while the strategic agreement provides a pathway for the resolution of all outstanding matters affecting the kumtor project there are no assurances that all of the conditions precedent to the completion of the settlement contained in the strategic agreement will be satisfied if the settlement contained in the strategic agreement is not completed there are no assurances that i the company will be able to successfully resolve any or all of the outstanding matters affecting the kumtor project or that any future discussions between the kyrgyz republic government and centerra will result in a mutually acceptable resolution or ii the kyrgyz republic government and or parliament will not take actions that are inconsistent with the government s obligations under the strategic agreement or kumtor project agreements including adopting a law denouncing or purporting to cancel or invalidate the kumtor project agreements or laws enacted in relation thereto which have the effect of nationalization of the kumtor project the inability to successfully resolve all such matters whether through the strategic agreement or otherwise could lead to suspension of operations of the kumtor project and would have a material adverse impact on the company s future cash flows earnings results of operations and financial condition furthermore if all such claims are not resolved as provided for in the strategic agreement and despite the company s view that all disputes related to the 2009 restated investment agreement should be determined in arbitration there are risks that the arbitrator may i reject the company s claims ii determine it does not have jurisdiction and or iii stay the arbitration pending determination of certain issues by the kyrgyz republic courts even if the company receives an arbitral award in its favour against the kyrgyz republic and or kyrgyzaltyn there are no assurances that it will be recognized or enforced in the kyrgyz republic accordingly the company may be obligated to pay part of or the full amounts of among others the siets claims and the kyrgyz state tax orders regardless of the action taken by the arbitrator the company does not have insurance or litigation reserves to cover these costs if the company were obligated to pay these amounts it would have a material adverse impact on the company s future cash flows earnings results of operations and financial condition other in 2018 the company initiated a review of its long term water treatment options at the endako mine as a result of ongoing discussions concerning mine reclamation obligations among regulatory and industry bodies in british columbia these discussions are ongoing but may result in amended regulations in 2019 as a result the company expects to update its technical studies and environmental studies for the endako mine later in 2019 the result of which may require an increase to endako s asset retirement obligation the company operates in multiple countries around the world and accordingly is subject to and pays taxes under the various regimes in those jurisdictions in which it operates these tax regimes are determined under general corporate income tax and other laws of the respective jurisdiction the company has historically filed and continues to file all required tax returns and to pay the taxes reasonably determined to be due the tax rules and regulations in many countries are complex and subject to interpretation from time to time the company s tax filings are subject to review and in connection with such reviews disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the company s interpretation of the country s tax laws the company records provisions for future disbursements considered probable as at march 31

republic diesel fuel for kumtor is sourced from separate russian suppliers the diesel fuel price assumptions were made when the price of oil was approximately 65 per barrel crude oil is a component of diesel fuel purchased by the company such that changes in the price of brent crude oil generally impacts diesel fuel prices the company established a hedging strategy to manage changes in diesel fuel prices on the cost of operations at the kumtor mine the company targets to hedge up to 50 of crude oil component of monthly diesel purchases exposure other material assumptions were used in forecasting production and costs for the remaining nine months 2019 these material assumptions include the following the mount milligan processing facility continues to have access to sufficient water supplies to operate year round at the intended capacity this includes management s expectations of annual average precipitation reduction in water losses deferrals to the sands and gravels continued ability to draw water from existing permitted water surface and groundwater sources identify and access new water wells available for permitting and capture permittable water sources from within the existing operations the company and the kyrgyz republic government government continue to work constructively to complete the kumtor strategic agreement the government does not take any actions that are contrary to the strategic agreement and or the kumtor project agreement and which have a material adverse impact on the kumtor operations and the kyrgyz proceedings are not reinstated or progressed contrary to the terms of the strategic agreement and or the kumtor project agreements the mine plans expertises and related permits and authorizations at kumtor which have been received to date for 2019 are not withdrawn and that any further approvals are obtained in a timely manner from relevant governmental agencies in the kyrgyz republic any recurrence of political or civil unrest in the kyrgyz republic will not impact operations including movement of people supplies and gold shipments to and from the kumtor mine and or power to the mine site any sanctions imposed on russian entities do not have a negative effect on the costs or availability of inputs or equipment to the kumtor project any political issues in turkey do not have a negative effect on the öksüt project the movement in the central valley waste dump at kumtor initially referred to in the annual information form for the year ended december 31 2013 and in the lysii and sarytor waste dumps does not accelerate and will be managed to ensure continued safe operations without impact to gold production the buttress constructed at the bottom of the davidov glacier continues to function as designed the company can manage the risks associated with the increased height of the pit walls at kumtor the dewatering program at kumtor continues to produce the expected results and the water management system works as planned the pit walls at kumtor and mount milligan remain stable and kumtor continues to successfully manage and mitigate ground movements in the vicinity of the kumtor mill and cut back 19 the resource block model at kumtor and mount milligan reconcile as expected against production grades and recoveries at kumtor and mount milligan remain consistent with the 2019 production plan to achieve the forecast gold and copper production the kumtor mill and the mount milligan mill continues to operate as expected including that there are no unplanned suspension of operations due to among other things structural mechanical or technical performance issues there are no changes to any existing agreements and relationships with affected indigenous groups which would materially and adversely impact our operations there are no unfavourable changes to concentrate sales arrangements at mount milligan and roasting arrangements at the langeloth facility third party logistic providers including canadian national railways and port workers in the port of vancouver can meet centerra s logistics needs and that a potential labour disruption affecting such port workers will not have a material effect on the company s ability to transport or sell concentrate from mount milligan there are no adverse regulatory changes affecting the kumtor and mount milligan operations and the company

slightly higher 0 4 million than the comparative quarter in 2018 milling costs amounted to 17 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 15 5 million in the comparative quarter of 2018 the increase is mainly from higher carbon fines processing costs 0 9 million as such operations were ramping up in the first quarter of 2018 higher grinding balls costs 0 6 million due to the processing of harder ore type and higher carbon costs 0 3 million mainly due to higher prices and consumption rate resulting from ore recovery optimization site support costs in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 11 8 million compared to 12 9 million in 2018 the decrease is attributable primarily due to lower costs for camp supplies 0 4 million due to lower consumption lower contractors costs 0 4 million due

same period of 2018 the decrease was mainly due to higher ounces sold and lower capitalized stripping as a result of accessing the main ore body in cut back 19 in the first quarter of 2019 and as a result ceasing the capitalization of stripping activities including revenue based taxes all in sustaining costs on a by product basis per ounce soldng was 735 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to

of 2019 kumtor carried out mining activities in cut back 19 in the vicinity of the mill building due to movement in the ground some cracking in the concrete foundation of the mill building was identified there was no impact observed in the grinding circuit and mill operations were not affected the company took a number of actions to stabilize the concrete mill foundations and mitigate further effects of the ground movement including shifting mining activities away from the immediate area relocating the boiler room where the most significant cracking was observed and implementing further de watering activities as a result movement of the mill foundations has ceased and remains stable the mill continues to operate at full production and kumtor maintains its 2019 production and cost guidance together with the assistance of external experts kumtor continues to review the ground conditions in the vicinity of the mill to ensure the safety and stability of the mill foundations

increased mount milligan s mill processing throughput as water levels increased in the mill s tailings storage facility the company expects that the additional water captured during the spring melt will be sufficient to allow mount milligan to return mill processing operations to full capacity 55 000 tonnes per day starting mid may and that mount milligan s mill throughput will average approximately 55 000 tonnes per day through the remainder of 2019 with respect to the updated long term water supply plan the company continues to work with relevant stakeholders to identify and evaluate water sources that will best be able to supply mount milligan s mill for the life of mine while meeting environmental and other parameters formal applications and government review is expected to commence later this year and will be the subject of discussion with regulators potentially affected indigenous groups local communities and other interested parties the company s expectation is that its updated long term water source or sources should be available after november 2021 for the entire life of mine see caution regarding forward looking information mount milligan

730 kyrgyz soms approximately 2 7 million respectively on march 27 2018 upon the application of siets the bishkek city court terminated each of the siets claims noted above however in april 2018 siets successfully appealed the decisions to terminate these claims and the claims have been returned to the court of first instance for further consideration despite this development the company expects these claims to be resolved in connection with the strategic agreement kyrgyz republic general prosecutor s office proceedings the company is and was subject to a number of other criminal proceedings commenced by the kyrgyz republic general prosecutor s office and other kyrgyz republic state agencies as described below criminal investigation into environmental matters kgc is also aware of an outstanding criminal investigation in the kyrgyz republic which concerns the same subject matter as the siets claims described above the company expects that this investigation will be terminated in connection with the strategic agreement land use claim as previously noted kgc had challenged the purported 2012 cancellation of its land use surface rights over the kumtor concession areas in the kyrgyz republic courts as well as in its arbitration claim described above on august 28 2017 the bishkek inter district court terminated the proceeding commenced by the gpo in respect of kumtor s land use rights over the kumtor concession area the company received new land use certificates on january 24 2019 kyrgyz state tax orders in august 2018 kgc commenced a claim in the kyrgyz courts refiled on september 26 2018 seeking to invalidate orders of the kyrgyz republic state tax service which reassessed taxes including sanctions and penalties owing from kgc for the period from 2016 to 2017 in the amount of 1 377 709 739 44 kyrgyz soms approximately 20 million primarily in relation to the alleged failure to pay taxes on high altitude premiums paid to employees at the kumtor mine site the kyrgyz court held a hearing in december 2018 and satisfied kgc s claim to invalidate the orders this court decision came into effect on january 10 2019 after the customary appeal period expired gpo review of kumtor project agreements on june 14 2016 according to reports in the kyrgyz republic the kyrgyz republic president instructed the gpo to investigate the legality of the agreements relating to the kumtor project which were entered into in 2003 2004 and 2009 the 2009 restated investment agreement governing the kumtor project which was entered into in 2009 superseded entirely the 2003 and 2004 agreements the 2009 restated investment agreement was negotiated with the kyrgyz republic government kyrgyzaltyn and their international advisers and approved by all relevant kyrgyz republic state authorities including the kyrgyz republic parliament and any disputes under the 2009 restated investment agreement are subject to resolution by international arbitration the company understands that this investigation has been closed with respect to certain individuals management assessment of outstanding kumtor matters as noted above the strategic agreement contained no admission on the part of centerra or its kyrgyz subsidiaries of i any environmental wrongdoing ii any non compliance with kyrgyz law or the kumtor project agreements or iii any pre existing obligation to make additional environmental or reclamation trust fund payments or environmental remediation efforts the company and kgc continue to dispute all of the allegations noted above while the strategic agreement provides a pathway for the resolution of all outstanding matters affecting the kumtor project there are no assurances that all of the conditions precedent to the completion of the settlement contained in the strategic agreement will be satisfied if the settlement contained in the strategic agreement is not completed there are no assurances that i the company will be able to successfully resolve any or all of the outstanding matters affecting the kumtor project or that any future discussions between the kyrgyz republic government and centerra will result in a mutually acceptable resolution or ii the kyrgyz republic government and or parliament will not take actions that are inconsistent with the government s obligations under the strategic agreement or kumtor project agreements including adopting a law denouncing or purporting to cancel or invalidate the kumtor project agreements or laws enacted in relation thereto which have the effect of nationalization of the kumtor project the inability to successfully resolve all such matters whether through the strategic agreement or otherwise could lead to suspension of operations of the kumtor project and would have a material adverse impact on the company s future cash flows earnings results of operations and financial condition furthermore if all such claims are not resolved as provided for in the strategic agreement and despite the company s view that all disputes related to the 2009 restated investment agreement should be determined in arbitration there are risks that the arbitrator may i reject the company s claims ii determine it does not have jurisdiction and or iii stay the arbitration pending determination of certain issues by the kyrgyz republic courts even if the company receives an arbitral award in its favour against the kyrgyz republic and or kyrgyzaltyn there are no assurances that it will be recognized or enforced in the kyrgyz republic accordingly the company may be obligated to pay part of or the full amounts of among others the siets claims and the kyrgyz state tax orders regardless of the action taken by the arbitrator the company does not have insurance or litigation reserves to cover these costs if the company were obligated to pay these amounts it would have a material adverse impact on the company s future cash flows earnings results of operations and financial condition other in 2018 the company initiated a review of its long term water treatment options at the endako mine as a result of ongoing discussions concerning mine reclamation obligations among regulatory and industry bodies in british columbia these discussions are ongoing but may result in amended regulations in 2019 as a result the company expects to update its technical studies and environmental studies for the endako mine later in 2019 the result of which may require an increase to endako s asset retirement obligation the company operates in multiple countries around the world and accordingly is subject to and pays taxes under the various regimes in those jurisdictions in which it operates these tax regimes are determined under general corporate income tax

legend connected in china at the highest levels warned the big risk for america is china dumps its dollar holdings igniting gold today a legend who is connected in china at the highest levels warned the big risk for america is that china dumps its us dollar holdings he also said investors should buy gold a deal with the chinese by john ing maison placements may 1 king world news tariffs have upset world markets and decades of america made supply chains helping cause in december the worst single month market sell off since the great depression because mr trump views the stock market as the one signifier of the us economy and a simplistic proxy for measuring the success of his policies this deal making president regularly sidelined his negotiating team believing that he could do better now tariff man trump wants a deal with the chinese because pressure for a deal has escalated daily with both sides ready to settle for a truce his politically important farming base pushed the president to work out an agreement since the tit for tat countermeasures hurt growth at a time when donald trump most needs a trade pact total us exports of soybeans fell 28 percent in march compared to a year ago although signing usmca over a year ago his tariffs on us steel and aluminum remain hurting us businesses and consumers alike moreover congress has yet to ratify the trade pact with the canadian and mexican legislatures threatening to balk at ratifying the agreement these deals reflect not how easy is trump s new order but how difficult trade deals aren t that easy to win it seems in fact the president s obsession on balanced trade between china and the us was doomed to fail because of america s huge service sector surplus with china yet it s germany not china that has the world s largest external account surplus and still not content with a victorious truce the president is to focus next on europe threatening to impose steel tariffs on foreign cars europe countered with 11 billion of tariffs and the beat goes on symbiotic relationship to be sure the recent us china tensions have escalated beyond trade and some believe that the war is really over technological supremacy our view is that while there is the appearance of two trading superpowers vying for advantage the us is most reliant on china whilst china is reliant on the us this quid pro quo arrangement stems from china s need for american markets for its goods and in turn the us need for outside funding alert mining legend ross beaty chairman pan american silver is investing in a company very few people know about to find out which company click here or on the image below sponsored unlike japan or china which finance their deficits internally the us is dependent on foreign offshore funds for up to a third of their deficits on the other hand china s generated surpluses are recycled in us treasuries and lately gold china today has 3 1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves the largest in the world and has been diversifying its reliance on the dollar seeking to internationalize the renminbi as a reserve currency currently five percent of foreign global reserves are in renminbi in contrast to almost 60 percent in dollars thus over the short term despite attempts to internationalize the renminbi both countries need each other in a symbiotic relationship america s growing isolation of concern is that in designing a new world order america s diplomatic isolation creates vacuums that their rivals fill for example trump s call for regime change in venezuela was rejected by russia who subsequently sent troops to protect the oil rich socialist nation and soon after china sent soldiers on a humanitarian mission to one of venezuela s military bases and in an effort to put pressure on cuba for their support of venezuela the us opened a can of worms by reactivating the helms burton act which was waived by every president over the past 25 years the international community had vehemently opposed the move because the act exposes european and canadian businesses to american lawsuits and in yet another move that escalated tensions with china trump s unilateral decision to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal not only isolated washington but the ending of the sanction waivers to any country importing iranian crude pits the us against allies india turkey japan and south korea the policy move further undercuts america s relationships deepening washington s sense of isolation and in focusing on iran and venezuela caused a spike in oil prices lighting a fuse to the geopolitical sensitive middle east only a month ago trump tweeted the world cannot afford an oil price hike fragile as is his policy america also criticized italy for joining china s belt and road plan bri beijing s global belt road initiative aims to finance and build roads ports and railways linking more than 80 countries including eurasia the middle east and africa italy is to be the first g7 country joining six eu countries to endorse the bri despite pressure from washington america has weaponized this participation as a them versus us argument as part of the china vs us conflict but that may not matter the us is playing catch up particularly in technology where china has more internet users generates more data and is at the forefront in 5g their tech sector is already ahead in batteries and chips

superpowers wrap up their trade truce global markets will rally however looking ahead a trade deal is not the panacea for the market we believe that this presents a sell on news opportunity as the market must then cope with a stagflation us economy overvalued valuations plus the long term impact of trade wars a brexit and a subsequent legacy of debt deficits and doom the deeper point is that the us trade deficit last year hit a 10 year high of 621 billion and despite the imposition of trump s tariffs the deficit rose 12 5 percent last year with a 6 3 percent expansion in us exports but a whopping 7 5 percent boost in imports with the trade numbers improving lately to eight month lows the us economy q1 gdp at 3 2 percent beat expectations however drilling down this was due more to a boost in inventories which offset an ominous drop in household spending in fact recent studies show that the cost of his tariff war has been borne by american consumers who have paid more in higher prices than the revenues that the tariffs were supposed to generate while america s debt and deficits must be financed for years to come inflation has been a no show despite corporate debt soaring to record highs exceeding pre crisis levels faced with chronic low interest rates junk bonds too have reached the same size of subprime mortgage debt which exacerbated the financial crisis of 2007 low bond yields have already done severe damage to global pension systems altering the risk profile of assets making leveraged bets potential time bombs bond sales boomed as the fed s pivot prompted a fresh binge in borrowing this boom has not yet gone bust abandoning monetary orthodoxy while lawmakers talk about the need to tackle trade the elephant in the room is spending and the resulting deficits both democrats and republicans it seems have given up on curbing deficits they are reluctant to cut spending in spite of the longest government shutdown in history instead they have come up with new and improved money printing ways to pay for their bills the democrats are pushing a new old theorem modern monetary theory mmt aka unlimited money printing to finance new spending programs such as the green new deal or medicare for all the democrats belief is rooted in a half century old phenomenon that government can always borrow in their own currency because they could easily create more money that spending falls in the same category as that other unconventional tool quantitative easing qe whose roots stem from former fed chairman ben bernanke s description of helicopter money which left a legacy of debt deficit and doom both qe and helicopter money involves the printing of money to expand money supply however by contrast helicopter money shoveled money into the system without increasing the fed s balance sheet economic orthodoxy wisdom suggests that large doses of government debt will eventually lead to higher inflation and interest rates the republicans and donald trump have pushed for an easier monetary policy calling for trillion dollar deficits and yet another dose of bond buying stimulus ironically the republicans instincts are rooted in the early seventies when once dormant inflation returned from the dead resurrected by a potent mixture of low interest rates the vietnam war and the pumping of liquidity into the economy today we again have record low interest rates the pumping of trillions not billions of liquidity into the financial system and moribund inflation however while main street has yet to experience higher core inflation wall street has seen an unprecedented virulent asset inflation fueled by a series of record highs unicorn ipos billion dollar buybacks and record leverage the republicans are set to even outspend the democrats the swamp of washington still needs to be drained in abandoning monetary orthodoxy the seeds of inflation have been sown and that should be of concern to investors and worse as part of today s voodoo economics mr trump has doubled down pushing the fed to pursue quantitative easing iv calling for even lower rates despite the fed s unexpected u turn in monetary policy to keep rates low and after shaking up homeland security in a crackdown on immigration he set his sights on shaking up the independent fed by filling two vacancies on the fed s powerful board with political allies for the last half century central banks were the last line of fiscal defense curbing economic booms and busts ironically the president s blatant attempt to pressure the fed is not dissimilar to other countries where the central banks of india venezuela turkey and argentina have also been pressured to loosen monetary policies it has happened before once before facing re election president nixon pressured fed chairman arthur burns to slash rates which boosted nixon s re election chances in 1972 back then runaway double digit inflation ensued and the consequence was near hyperinflation and a crash nixon resigned but left to clean up the mess was fed chair paul volcker who slapped on double digit interest rates to stamp out inflation a deep recession of course followed while attempts to influence

listen to doug casey s just released kwn interview discussing his prediction of financial and economic chaos and a panic into gold click here or below sponsored at center stage is the us dollar for over half a century the us government has enjoyed the preeminent privilege of being allowed to print and borrow in their own currency thanks to its role as the primary world s reserve currency america could not default because they could always print new money to pay their creditors that privilege once enjoyed by great britain was lost in the forties when britain s debts exceeded their ability to pay the united states like britain before has taken that privilege for granted we believe america s fiscal irresponsibility jeopardizes that status president trump has called a halt to the unwinding and normalization of the fed s balance sheet which is choking already from the legacy of monetizing three rounds of bond buying he also threatened to replace his handpicked fed chairman jerome powell drawing a critical fault line through the fed s independence the consequences for the dollar are far reaching in shaking up the fed and pushing for a looser policy trump and his team s ignorance of the inexorable rise in debt compromises the very foundation of the world s reserve currency déjà vu against this backdrop america s public debt has now ratcheted up to a record 22 trillion boosted by the unfunded tax cut which increased 18 percent in spending violating the spending cap the fed s balance sheet at 4 trillion is weighed down with excessive exposure to government debt which is a potential systemic problem in contrast to only 1 trillion in 2008 that other large structural deficit continues to grow as trump unleashed a 4 75 trillion budget which won t get congressional approval trump s spending plans call for a debt to gdp of 100 percent plus this year and the interest payments alone to service that debt exceeds 500 billion or more than the us spends on defense spending and despite the decline of america s credit rating in 2011 and a decade after the financial crisis us public debt remains at double a s p and now mr trump and his administration is set to push the us into the deepest deficits on record america s financial hegemony is not sustainable to be sure after a decade of record stock market gains and ipo unicorns the world s central banks should be threatening to pull the punch bowl away however the december market collapse was the worst on record as the stock market vigilantes took matters into their own hands causing the fed and other central banks to execute a u turn putting interest rates on hold which drove markets again to new record levels however if december was anything it was a wake up call for too long the united states have mismanaged its finances consuming more than they are producing we also believe that america s established control over global finance and weaponization of sanctions threatens america s central role in world s financial markets with more than 10 trillion of bonds showing negative yields fears of deflation are growing like the thirties investors are paying also for the privilege to park their money and if held to redemption would lose money noteworthy was during the dirty thirties gold was a hedge against deflation acting as a store of value whilst asset prices plummeted in a deflationary spiral we believe that the trump inspired trade wars an unpredictable presidency together with the weaponization of american financial hegemony has in large part forced investors to look for alternatives the dollar s global role gives america the means to impose financial sanctions to great effect it can exclude countries from the dollar based international payments system trump s populist approach whilst thumbing his nose at foreign investors has resulted in a weakening view of the us dollar although there are few alternatives america s financial hegemony is simply not sustainable gold is a hedge against that the us is not dissimilar to an emerging market economy where their balance of payments is as terrible as their fiscal debt today the greenback has run into resistance on fears of a protracted trade war and an inverted yield curve geopolitics is playing a greater part here as the global repercussion spreads america depends on the very countries that it labels a security risk to finance their consumption how naïve and dangerous on that point our view is that the fed has reached the limits of its abilities with a balance sheet which represents more than 25 percent of us gdp with one third of america s debt financed by outsiders an inverted yield curve has encouraged investors to look elsewhere we believe that the us financial hegemony and deteriorating financial status has jeopardized the dollar s reserve status and we are near that point of inflection where like great britain before creditors will balk at financing us obligations gold is making its way back into the global monetary system to learn more click here sponsored gold has become money again fittingly gold is an alternative to the dollar in the past it has been a protector or hedge against the debasement of currency because it is less susceptible to government manipulation last year central banks purchased a near record 23 million ounces becoming the world s largest buyer adding to their reserves at the highest pace in 50 years central banks keep dollars in reserve but under the new basel iii standard gold has taken on more importance and can be today valued the same as dollars basel iii returns gold as a meaningful reserve asset whereby gold is now risk weighted as a tier i asset as part of total reserves thus gold reserves held on central banks balance sheet can be valued at 100 percent allowing them to increase their liquidity and revalue their balance sheets upward gold has become money again in total governments added 652 tonnes in 2018 the second highest total on record according to the world gold council they see gold as an alternative to the dollar china has been on a gold buying spree recently purchasing gold again for the past four months laying a foundation of gold in their 3 1 trillion reserve stockpile china is the world s largest consumer of gold and must import gold to satisfy domestic demands china is also the world s largest creditor and their gold holdings make them less dependent on the dollar particularly since the united states has weaponized the dollar other countries are diversifying with saudi arabia considering dropping the petrodollar and even threatening to dump their stockpile of treasuries should congress lift sovereign immunity from us antitrust laws nopec russia has already replaced the dollar with gold dumping all their us debt purchasing one third of the world s gold supplies last year they have tripled their reserves over the past decade as a counter to the us dollar dominance and hold 2 163 tonnes of gold russia and china have become the fifth and sixth largest gold holders in the world rivaling america which has the largest stockpile at 8 000 tonnes the risk for america is that china also dumps its dollar

quarter sales volumes of western red cedar wrc declined 15 compared to last year as poor weather impacted market demand first quarter japan lumber shipments declined 14 the addition of columbia vista led to an increase in douglas fir product sales to japan which was more than offset by weakness in sales of hemlock and yellow cedar hemlock market share has been challenged by subsidized japanese

markets that have been unresponsive to weaker lumber pricing as a result of the misalignment between the coastal stumpage system and lumber market pricing we resumed export log sales in the second quarter of 2019 bc coastal saw log purchases were 208 000 cubic metres a 22 decrease from the same quarter last year due to lower market log availability strong demand from export markets and pulp manufacturers and lower harvest levels due in part to rising stumpage rates have limited market log supply to domestic sawmills consistent with our strategy we increased direct lumber sales to china to mitigate weak north american lumber pricing increased direct sales volumes to china combined with the impact of a weaker canadian dollar cad on united states dollar usd denominated freight and fuel costs led to a 1 8 million increase in freight expense compared to the first quarter of 2018 first quarter adjusted ebitda and operating income included 9 2 million of countervailing duty cvd and anti dumping duty ad as compared to 9 7 million in the same quarter last year duty expense declined as a result of reduced shipment volume offset by higher values for us destined lumber shipments selling and administration expense first quarter selling and administration expense was 8 8 million in 2019 as compared to 8 6 million in the same period last year incremental expense arose from sales and marketing initiatives board recruitment and foundational system and process improvements in support of our growth strategy finance costs finance costs were 1 5 million compared to 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher average outstanding debt of 55 3 million in 2019 compared to none outstanding in 2018 the company had drawings of 84 0 million on the credit facility as at march 31 2019 as a result of adopting ifrs 16 leases on january 1 2019 we recognized 0 2 million of finance costs on lease payments in comparative periods leasing finance costs were recognized in operating income net income net income for the first quarter of 2019 was 1 9 million as compared to 21 7 million for the same period of 2018 operating margins and net income were reduced by lower production and shipment volumes and higher operating expenses columbia vista asset acquisition on february 1 2019 we completed the asset acquisition of columbia vista corporation and related entities operations in vancouver washington this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of pursuing margin focused business opportunities that complement our position in selected markets bringing western and columbia vista together provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan which will support our bc based hemlock programs the combination of columbia vista and western makes us more meaningful to our selected customers and creates a stronger company for all our employees sale of ownership interest in port alberni forest operations on march 29 2019 we completed the sale of a 7 interest in our newly formed tfl 44 limited partnership tfl 44 lp to the huu ay aht first nations for gross proceeds of 7 3 million tfl 44 lp s assets consist of tfl 44 and certain other associated assets and liabilities of our port alberni forest operation we will continue to source fibre from tfl 44 lp to support our bc manufacturing facilities as part of the agreement we may sell huu ay aht first nations an incremental interest in the limited partnership subject to further negotiation other expense and operating restructuring items other expense for the first quarter of 2019 includes 0 7 million of transaction costs associated with the columbia vista acquisition operating restructuring costs were 2 2 million in the first quarter of 2018 due to severance and related expenses attributable to ongoing business optimization initiatives the indefinite curtailment of our somass sawmill and retraining of employees affected by the closure of the englewood train our somass sawmill remains indefinitely curtailed as a result of a fibre supply deficit arising from years of tenure takebacks and government land use decisions and rising costs associated with the united states us softwood lumber dispute we are evaluating options to create a sustainable long term solution for the site and we are considering the input of government first nations and other stakeholders income taxes current income tax expense of 0 8 million was recognized in net income in the first quarter of 2019 total income tax expense decreased by 7 3 million from the first quarter of 2018 as a result of lower operating earnings as we used the majority of our remaining non capital loss carryforwards during the second quarter of 2018 cash taxes were payable for the tax year ended december 31 2018 in may 2018 the company received correspondence from the canada revenue agency cra regarding certain restructuring transactions occurring in 2004 and 2007 to 2011 and the general anti avoidance rule management believes the cra s position is without merit management is prepared to defend its position if a notice of reassessment is issued and as such the company has not recognized any income tax provision as at march 31 2019 relating to this matter recent developments bc government forest policies in 2018 the bc provincial government the province introduced a coastal revitalization initiative and further policy initiatives that will affect the bc forest sector on april 1 2019 the province announced the creation of fibre recovery zones which are intended to increase the supply of residual fibre from primary harvesting for secondary users on april 1 2019 the province announced bill 21 forest and range practices amendment act 2019 designed to increase opportunities for public input improve information sharing on forest planning strengthen the minister s ability to manage forest activity expand the definition of wildlife to help protect at risk species and improve and streamline range use planning on april 11 2019 the province announced bill 22 forest amendment act 2019 if passed the new legislation will require approval from the minister before disposal or transfer of a tenure agreement to a third party the act will enable the minister to refuse to approve a disposition or transfer if it is deemed not to be in the public interest or detrimental to competition in the buying or selling of timber or residuals or to place conditions on the approval the impact that these policy initiatives may have on our operations cannot be determined at this time appointment of new independent directors on march 1 2019 western announced the appointment of laura cillis and cheri phyfer to its board of directors the board in accordance with the company s planned board renewal process these appointments follow the february 12 2019 appointment of michael waites to chair of the board strategy and outlook western s long term business objective is to create superior value for shareholders by building a margin focused log and lumber business of scale to compete successfully in global softwood markets we believe this will be achieved by maximizing the sustainable utilization of our forest tenures operating safe efficient low cost manufacturing facilities and augmenting our sales of targeted high value specialty products for selected global customers with a lumber wholesale program we seek to manage our business with a focus on operating cash flow and maximizing value through the production and sales cycle we routinely evaluate our performance using the measure of return on capital employed sales marketing strategy update we are progressing with the execution of our sales and marketing strategy that focuses on the production and sale of targeted high margin products of scale to selected customers we supplement our key product offerings with purchased lumber to deliver the suite of products our customers require our columbia vista acquisition provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan in the first quarter of 2019 we accelerated wholesale purchases to 11 million board feet in anticipation of spring building season and sold 5 million board feet market outlook despite recent lumber pricing volatility and slow seasonal demand due to weather events our long term view of market fundamentals remains unchanged in north america rising lumber consumption will continue to be driven by increased new home construction a robust repair and renovation sector and growth in the use of mass timber building technologies we expect lumber demand in china to continue to grow due to a government commitment to housing and economic stimulus while in japan lumber consumption is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years in north america prolonged winter weather has delayed the onset of the spring building season resulting in a supply demand imbalance and commodity lumber pricing volatility as weather improves in north america we expect to see recovery in demand and pricing for commodity lumber we anticipate any pricing response will be moderated by higher than normal inventories and additional supply as idled commodity lumber capacity returns we will continue to monitor prices and make adjustments in our operating plans accordingly improved weather conditions will also create opportunities for our western red cedar products we anticipate prices to remain stable for wrc timbers and wide width products the narrow width wrc lumber market is expected to remain weak due to competition from low price imported lumber and an abundant supply of narrow width us domestic cedar lumber we will continue to focus on managing our product mix to mitigate the pricing impacts in japan we anticipate demand will be relatively stable ahead of the proposed increase in the japanese consumption tax we expect hemlock pricing to remain under pressure from subsidized japanese domestic product substitution while pricing for our douglas fir products may be slightly weaker we expect to grow both volumes and price realizations for our niche products as we continue to refine the product offerings from our duke point sawmill we intend to leverage the planer rebuild and auto grader installation to improve recovery and lower costs we expect domestic saw log prices to decline in response to weaker lumber markets price declines may be mitigated by low saw log supply as coastal log production may decline due to stumpage rates that have become disconnected from the lumber market strategic capital program update we continue to implement a strategic capital program that is designed to position western as the only company capable of sustainably consuming the complete profile of the coastal forest and competitively manufacturing a diverse product mix for global markets our strategic capital program is focused on the installation of technology that will deliver top quartile performance and improve our ability to manufacture targeted products that yield the best margin in addition to investments in our manufacturing assets we also allocate capital to strategic high return projects involving our information systems timberlands assets and forest inventories in the first quarter of 2019 we completed the acquisition of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington and invested 3 8 million to substantially complete arlington infrastructure and equipment upgrades commissioning has started and we expect to begin secondary processing at arlington early in the second quarter in bc we took delivery of the first ten forklifts as we begin implementation of our centralized fleet management program and progressed on a number of small high return capital projects focused on debottlenecking our manufacturing operations softwood lumber dispute and us market update western s results for the first quarter of 2019 include 9 2 million of export duty expense comprised of cvd and ad expense at march 31 2019 western had 71 4 million of cash on deposit with the us department of treasury in respect of these softwood lumber duties on april 9 2019 a world trade organization wto panel ruled on certain matters relating to the application of softwood lumber anti dumping duties concluding that the us violated international trade rules in the way it calculated anti dumping duties included in the ruling the wto panel has allowed the us to use zeroing in its calculation of ad which canada will appeal the practice of zeroing had previously been disallowed by the wto with regard to softwood lumber the final determination of ad is subject to additional appeals from both the us and canada the us application of duties continues a long standing pattern of us protectionist action against canadian lumber producers we disagree with the us trade determination and the inclusion of specialty lumber products particularly western red cedar and yellow cedar products in this commodity lumber focused dispute as duties paid are determined on the value of lumber exported and as our shipments to the us market are predominantly high value appearance grade lumber we are disproportionately impacted by these duties we have filed a chapter 19 north american free trade agreement nafta separate like product challenge on which a ruling is not expected until late 2019 us market sales represent less than 25 of western s total revenue in 2018 continued strong demand and a lack of supply has supported improvements in our specialty lumber product pricing partly offsetting the impact of duties our acquisition of a distribution and processing centre in arlington washington and the assets of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington are expected to partially mitigate the damaging effects of duties on our products destined for the us market while increasing us market sales we intend to leverage our flexible operating platform to continue to overcome any challenges that arise from this trade dispute forward looking statements and information this press release contains statements

information currently available to us and refer only as of the date hereof except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements reference is made in this press release to adjusted ebitda which is defined as operating income prior to operating restructuring items and other income plus amortization of property plant equipment and intangible assets impairment adjustments and changes in fair value of biological assets adjusted ebitda margin is ebitda presented as a proportion of revenue western uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors we consider adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because amortization expense impairment adjustments and changes in the fair value of biological assets are non cash costs and vary widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities further the inclusion of operating restructuring items which are unpredictable in nature and timing may make comparisons of our operating results between periods more difficult we also believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance adjusted ebitda does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by international financial reporting standards ifrs and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs furthermore adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under ifrs and should not be considered as alternatives to measure performance under ifrs moreover because all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in the same manner these measures as calculated by western may differ from similar measures as calculated by other companies a reconciliation between the company s net income as reported in accordance with ifrs and adjusted ebitda is included in the company s management s discussion analysis for the year ended december 31 2018 which is available under the company s profile on sedar at www sedar com also in this press release management uses key performance indicators such as net debt net debt to capitalization and current assets to current liabilities net debt is defined as long term debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt to capitalization is a ratio defined as net debt divided by capitalization with capitalization being the sum of net debt and equity current assets to current liabilities is defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities these key performance indicators are non gaap financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers they are not recognized by ifrs however they are meaningful in that they indicate the company s ability to meet their obligations on an ongoing basis and indicate whether the company is more or less leveraged than the prior year western is an integrated forest products company building a margin focused log and lumber business to compete successfully in global softwood markets with operations and employees located primarily on the coast of british columbia and washington state western is a premier supplier of high value

european integration has been transformed into neo liberal project when the economic crisis and global competition were strengthened starting from 1970s there were other important occurrences which caused a shift in economic model like 1973 oil price hike 1975 u s defeat in vietnam halt in bretton woods system in 1971 after keynesianism rising social responsibilities of states and caring the class which consumes without producing also accelerated unavoidable economic shift particularly after economic crisis in 1973 it was identified that traditional approaches to economy is insufficient structural weakness of the economy was also revealed in the comparison with the u s and japan s economic development in this situation three main debates appeared over restructuring socio economic order of europe the fundamental axis of ideological struggles within the european capitalist class in the beginning of 1980s constituted the contrast between neo mercantilism and neo liberalism neo mercantilists had the view of europeanism they were the main industries which were producing for only europe therefore they wanted to create a strong european market which is resilient to outside competition thus how and to what extent the european capitalist class has shaped the transformation of the european order largely depended on the outcome of the struggle between europeanists and globalists the third adversary capitalist model social democratic model appeared in the second half of 1980s the main concern of this model was that social dimension should be added to the completion of internal market social democracy model was suggested by jacques delors in 1985 president of european commission with promising high level of social protection against the possible disruptive forces of neoliberalism and globalization thus european social model appeared in delors vision that european capitalism should combine both the needs for welfare and sustainable growth social solidarity and competitive market to reach these goals it was aimed to create strong european institutions and support state building programs together with market building to make european market stronger against the global competition converged social model defenders to neo mercantilists indeed all three models supported the accomplishment of internal market however the significant friction occurred on the question how the single market should be completed the answer of neoliberalism was that trade liberalization should be increased and large external openness should be added there on the other hand social model supported regulation of market by a single supra national power namely commission the third project neo mercantilism supported interventionist industrial policy by increasing external tariffs in order to protect the internal market form outside competition the debate on the completion of market was resulted with the victory of neo liberalist model of capitalism the steady support and lobbying of corporate sector while the weakness of labor unions were the main reasons for the victory of neo liberalism in europethe shift towards state ownership or privatization labor markets flexibilisation and pressure on wage demands started to be strengthened form 1980s which significantly decreased the power of labor unions while support for further liberalization has been increased with the 200 tncs and 500 corporate lobby groups based in brussels it wasn t thought that the ignorance of labors social demands will cause resurgence of social model neo gramscian theorist van apeldoorn particularly mentions the promotion activities of european round table industrialists for global liberalism the turn of neo liberalism has certainly been started in european integration after the creation of single market in 1987 neo liberalist approach was promoted with the claim of treating the deficiencies of the social welfare state like increase in welfare formation of rational and responsible individuality and productivity in the beginning it was accepted to provide a middle path social democratic and state intervention along with the free market however the further development of the approach was far from meeting the expectations of social policy and social welfare in particular the increasing welfare gap among social classes income inequalities increase in poverty and interest rates erosion of job security and rise in the levels of unregistered employment increased the discontent substantially in the social sectors after completion of single market further steps in integration like european monetary union lisbon strategy have been totally based on economic liberalization and preference for competition considering anti globalization movements eu became active in social policy improvement whereas these movements were constrained by the claims for competitiveness economic efficiency and stabilization for example phipip whyman mark baimbridge and andrew mullen exemplify 1989 social charter and 1999 luxembourg and cologne process for the creation of european employment pact they argue that the former process aimed to respect for national differences in social systems and the latter planned to deliver job creating growth and decrease the burden on workers by reforming taxation and social security systems however the authors criticize that employment policy guidelines have been left for the decision and control of member states according to cologne process member states had to develop and implement their national action plans for employment improvement on their own and then they could publish the consequences in the joint employment report after commission s approval they further claim that in this situation there can t be formed a unified eu level welfare state social policy agenda 2000 under lisbon strategy aimed to modernize social protection and to create more and better jobs however there was a critic about eu s social initiatives that all social policies were limited to voluntary coordination and social dialogue which shows the absence of willing for formulating a common and regulated mechanism starting from 1990s there appeared important deficiencies in neoliberalism which gave a way for resurgence of esm discourse one of the main flaws was related to the rising power of trans national corporations corporations unwillingness for organized labor market stabilizing welfare benefits by ensuring work pays and increase in payment for social expenditure resulted with rise in poverty and social inequalities they have played a crucial role in transforming of world order by penetrating not only to economy but also to policy making process through lobbying endeavors and media by using propaganda phipip whyman mark baimbridge and andrew mullen argue in their book that tncs started to govern the economics and became more wealthy and powerful after neo liberal revolution and spreading the dominance of globalization for example worldwide sales of tncs were smaller than world exports in 1960 however they got 247 per cent of world exports in 2000 following this chomsky also declared neo liberal world order as new imperial age by claiming that world bank gatt imf were programmed to serve the interests of tncs and investment firms global trade in services and goods started to be dependent on tncs and this process of corporate concentration has been speed up by trade deals like single market in 1987 or nafta in 1994 moreover as the two third of tncs were based in north japan europe north america fdis in the form of acquisitions and cross border mergers were substantially centered in core countries this concentration of fdis deepen core periphery divergence and make periphery stay outside by increasing interpenetration of core countries neo liberal policies and its social consequences source peters john labour market deregulation and the decline of labour power in north america and western europe policy and society 2008 83 98 neoliberalism has been unsuccessful to reach its aims in terms of social well being and economic efficiency if we compare the period 1980 2000 with the previous twenty years 1960 1980 then we can easily identify that the latter period has been more successful in terms of well being indicators and quality of life than the former furthermore annual rate of economic growth per capita has been lower in the eu when neo liberalism peaked in 2000 the author also elaborates that class inequalities have increased substantially in europe s capitalist countries to prove the hypothesis of increasing income inequality branco milanovic came a conclusion that world population s top 1 per cent obtained 57 per cent of the world income between 1995 and 2000 income and other social inequalities have appeared due to the class determined policies in other words as neo gramscian theorists argue hegemon classes in the form of lobby groups european round table of industrialists world economic forum trilateral commission and so on directly influence to the decisions of governments these decision and policies constitute the core of neo liberalism which undermined the implementation of social policies one of the main public policy in neoliberalism was the deregulation of labor markets john peters argues in his article that the most significant consequence of labor markets deregulation was the decline in salaries and job security while rise in temporary employment this policy also eliminated the power of trade unions to change the nature of jobs through collective negotiations the initiative of deregulation and allowing businesses to define wages have been started by ronald reagan and margaret thatcher with claim of supporting businesses table 1 shows the percentage of trade union membership in the eu after the launch of neoliberalism until its peak 2003 between this period of time we can observe a slight decline in the membership for trade unions in developed countries table 1 trade union density then deregulation of financial markets and commerce in goods and services were followed deregulation for consumers was beneficial in terms of having more choices and superior customer service however it was more detrimental for consumers who have worse socio economic conditions these types of customers can t pay more for products and have been left for the mercy of businesses who mainly care their profits than social responsibility another crucial neo liberal policy was the reduction of social public expenditures which was harmful for working class government spending on social programmes has been cut through austerity measures which aimed to reduce budget deficits member countries started to reduce public debts and budget deficits within austerity measures after maastricht convergence criteria which sharpened the already high unemployment rates the trouble due to rising unemployment rates persuaded european council to formulate european stability pact in 1997 which has played a crucial role in the process of cutting social expenditures the main objective of stability and growth pact was to ensure the commitment of member states to the maastricht convergence criteria however the commitment about keeping deficit below 3 per cent of gnp has been strengthened which resulted with large reductions of social public expenditures the situation deteriorated for working class who use public services with the next policy of privatization of services u k s large privatization experience has been a model for other countries in particular after maastricht convergence criteria privatization aimed to reduce public debt level and budget deficit privatization of assets and public sector services was continued after euro crisis in 2008 under troika from the beginnings of 1990s the discourse of promotion of ant interventionism has been reinforced under neo liberal model despite the acceptance of state interventionism in neo liberalism the new discourse of ant interventionism appeared to support the interests of tncs and dominant classes matthew eagleton pierce explains the promotion of individualism and consumerism in neo liberalism and relates the term of individualism with the term of choice he further claims that the relationship between neo liberalism and consumer choice is in contrast with the culture of collectivism starting from the 1970s collective forms of socio economic organization has been challenged by business lobbies and conservative governments to show the correlation he exemplifies that the decline in trade union participation in western europe started to weaken socialist inspired goals and to erode bargaining positions

measured by the course of history over the last half century the arc of the economic universe has bent badly toward injustice it has been more than eighty years since the national labor relations act offered the first significant federal protections of industrial workers rights to organize and the social security act laid the basis for an attenuated welfare state new deal policies were hardly panaceas african americans immigrants and women never enjoyed their fruits on an equal basis with white men yet over time the struggles of unions and the civil rights and feminist movements widened the protections workers were able to win from the law and from organizing between world war ii and the mid 1970s as union density crested at 35 percent of the non agricultural workforce in the 1950s and then spread through the public sector in the 1960s the united states experienced a broadly shared prosperity the arc of the economic universe has bent badly toward injustice but over the last four decades we have witnessed the near total destruction of this promise of worker empowerment beginning with reagan the u s economy was reorganized wholesale having failed to build up political leverage to ensure that private economic power remained accountable to the common good workers saw private interests progressively shred the limited social bargain of the postwar years union membership has plummeted to 10 5 percent overall and only 6 4 percent in the private sector even more telling is the near disappearance of strikes in the 1970s there were on average about 289 annual work stoppages involving at least 1 000 workers as bargaining power shifted decisively to employers that average has plunged reaching only 13 per year over the last decade the result today is a staggeringly unjust global economy in which just eight men own as much wealth as half the world s population we now face a perverse concentration of wealth among the super rich pervasive financialization of the economy an upsurge of low wage and precarious work and the heightened power of monopolistic tech firms these transformations have relentlessly undercut worker bargaining power triggered an explosive rise in inequality and continue to undermine what remains of democratic governance and even as they tighten their grip the architects of inequality seek to control the alternatives we envision for our future in recent years they have promoted fevered future of work scenarios that imagine the disappearance of jobs before sweeping waves of automation and artificial intelligence hyping visions of the future of work that place capital s needs at the center the left is alive with creative energy not seen in many decades we must exploit it to make the future of workers not the future of work our central concern despite this grim turn of labor history in the united states there are many new reasons for hope interest in unions is surging and worker organizing is gaining ground in influential sectors including new media and higher education young people have begun to question some of the central assumptions of capitalism and have revived interest in democratic socialism the attention that activists have given to the intersectional nature of most struggles for justice has diminished the conflicts that once pitted advocates of a universalistic majoritarian left against those who feared that the voices of minorities and the excluded would be marginalized in such a movement the left is alive with creative energy not seen in many decades we must exploit it to make the future of workers not the future of work our central concern this new labor energy is partly reflected in the encouraging extent to which national politicians are acknowledging the need to rebuild worker power senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders have each offered bills that would empower workers warren s accountable capitalism act would require that all corporations designate 40 percent of seats on their boards of directors for representatives elected by employees and that those with more than 1 billion in annual revenue to obtain charters from the federal government sanders s workplace democracy act would ease union organizing and legalize secondary boycotts although legislative initiatives such as these are clearly necessary we believe they are also insufficient laws will not save us workers struggles and organizations must play a central role in shaping the twenty first century if we are to win the changes we need but workers will not be able to do that by clinging to strategies of the past the world that gave rise to the new deal and the great society in the united states and to social democracy in europe no longer exists the strategies that arose in response to twentieth century capitalism from traditional collective bargaining to co determination are therefore unlikely to be sufficient to the needs of the future this new labor energy is partly reflected in the encouraging extent to which national politicians are acknowledging the need to rebuild worker power the outlines of new labor thinking are visible in the recent efforts of unions and their allies to remake collective bargaining and organizing campaigns for the twenty first century these efforts have given rise to a conscious rethinking and broadeni ng of the participants processes and purposes of organizing and collective bargaining first while twentieth century collective bargaining was generally binary and involved only employers and unions recent efforts have attempted to broaden participation to give the community and other stakeholders a place at the bargaining table second while traditional collective bargaining was generally conducted behind closed doors by seasoned professionals who haggled over details recent efforts have infused the processes of bargaining with greater militancy opened it up to greater transparency and employed political action as a form of bargaining and third while traditional collective bargaining was focused on winning a serviceable contract that would signal a demobilization of the union s membership recent efforts have undertaken contract campaigns as steps in a long term strategy of worker empowerment they try to build enduring alignments between unions and their allies that accumulate lasting power through campaign victories a shared and increasingly fleshed out infrastructure and a common vision and narrative labor activists willingness to experiment can be traced to a conjuncture of developments triggered by the great recession president barack obama s agenda was derailed by the 2010 midterm elections which sidelined the union s hoped for labor law reform the employee free choice act propelled to power antiunion republican governors such as wisconsin s scott walker and tightened the grip of austerity politics on all levels of government union leaders increasingly recognized that they needed a bigger vision if they hoped to turn back the union assaults that gathered strength having secured obama s reelection they embarked on new initiatives laws will not save us workers will not be able to build a better future by clinging to strategies of the past in 2013 for instance president larry cohen of the communications workers of america helped launch the democracy initiative an alliance of labor civil rights and environmental groups to counter the corrosive influence of corporate money on politics fight voter suppression and address other obstacles to significant reform meanwhile afl cio president richard trumka moved to involve worker centers and other non union worker organizations in the planning for the 2013 afl cio convention the most significant catalysts for change were the emergence of new models of mobilization and organizing a turning point for these came in 2011 with the launching of three such models each of which in their own way signaled new departures in january the executive board of the service employees international union seiu approved an ambitious campaign called the fight for a fair economy which saw seiu commit tens of millions of dollars to organizing projects among low wage workers in multiple cities that effort would spawn local campaigns such as minnesotans for a fair economy mfe and ultimately lead to the fight for 15 a national movement to gain a living wage for fast food workers in july jobs with justice the national network of unions and community allies joined with the national domestic workers alliance to create the caring across generations campaign a national initiative to transform the long term care system and empower care workers over time it built an alliance that united over 200 organizations networking among care workers families whose loved ones need care and care recipients who wish to live at home with dignity and independence finally in september came the seemingly spontaneous eruption of the occupy wall street movement which seeded new and unexpected alliances among unions and their allies in many cities and spurred a discussion of inequality and the predatory nature of financialized capitalism that resonated well beyond the participants in its encampments recent years have seen a conscious rethinking and broadeni ng of the participants processes and purposes of organizing and collective bargaining a year later in september 2012 a precedent setting strike by the chicago teachers union ctu against the austerity regime of democratic mayor rahm emanuel attracted the attention of the entire labor movement and foreshadowed new approaches to bargaining led by karen lewis whose caucus of rank and file educators slate was elected to the ctu s top posts in 2010 the union prepared an innovative bargaining campaign in partnership with community groups and parents it called for smaller class sizes improved facilities and a host of other items that went beyond the confines of wages hours and other narrowly defined work issues about which the union was legally permitted to bargain the union also documented the schools financial mismanagement it showed how tax increment funding that could have helped schools was instead lavished on private entities such as the chicago mercantile exchange and it exposed risky interest rate swap deals in which chicago s school system ended up squandering more than 100 million by making the financial industry s exploitation of the school district an issue the ctu earned public support for its call for adequate school funding although the ctu did not win all of its demands its campaign inspired others to take on austerity politics in 2013 the st paul federation of teachers spft mounted a contract campaign that resembled the ctu s it patiently built an alliance with parents and community groups and with them jointly drew up twenty nine demands including one insisting that the school district cease doing business with banks that foreclose on their students families the union refused to back down when the school district refused to negotiate over many of them after rallying broad community support the st paul teachers won most of what they sought i had negotiated almost a dozen previous contracts for the spft explained the union s president mary cathryn ricker but for the first time i felt that signing a contract was just one step in building a larger movement meanwhile seiu local 503 which represents homecare childcare and university and state workers inaugurated a campaign called in it together that built alliances with the community by calling for a broad investigation into the ways in which banks were ripping off oregonians and demanding a state lawsuit against banks to recoup millions that were lost from retirement funds due to the secret manipulation of the london interbank offered rate libor a new strategy of bargaining and alliance building emerged from these campaigns in may 2014 many of the activists involved convened in washington where they gave that strategy a name bargaining for the common good bcg soon that style was spreading to new settings such as los angeles where the city s leading public sector unions and their community based allies launched the fix l a coalition in 2014 that coalition brought seiu the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme and other public sector unions together with community groups and faith based organizations they exposed the fact that more taxpayer money was spent paying fees to the wall street firms that marketed l a s municipal bonds and other financial services than on maintaining the city s streets furthermore they demanded that l a use its 106 billion worth of assets payments and debt issuance as leverage to demand better deals with wall street so that it can invest more in our communities at the outset bcg campaigns were meticulously planned in some cases the groundwork was carefully laid over a period of more than a year before they were launched yet the basic principles of that approach have proven to be adaptable in more spontaneous struggles as the teachers mobilizations of 2018 illustrated beginning in west virginia in january 2018 and spreading to such union averse states as oklahoma and arizona those mobilizations were in effect organizing bargaining and political campaigns all at once the workplace centered economism of new deal america is yielding to broader forms of organization social bargaining and democratic experiment teachers across the country gravitated toward a common good framework linking their struggles to the needs of their communities and targeted the most powerful economic forces in their states in west virginia teachers in all of the state s 55 school district walked off the job called attention to the fact that the state s wealthiest were paying scant taxes and refused to return to work until all state workers had received a pay increase equal to the one the state legislature granted them in oklahoma they protested the state s failure to fairly tax wealthy oil and gas interests in arizona they demanded that the state enact no further tax cuts until the state s per pupil spending on education reached the national average and briefly succeeded in getting an initiative on the 2018 ballot that would have taxed the wealthy to fund schools before the arizona supreme court had it removed on a technicality since the vast majority of strikers were not union members these walkouts were both massive organizing campaigns and democracy campaigns as well they posed explicit political demands such as raising taxes to fund public schools more adequately they instinctively adopted a bcg approach in that they were not just about wages or benefits but also about improving education and fighting for fairer taxation the teacher walkouts ensured that more workers walked out on strike in 2018 than any year since 1986 in january 2019 united teachers of los angeles extended that militancy the strike it launched was not only the eighth major u s teachers strike over a twelve month span but also the largest one yet and the one most explicitly employed a bcg approach with strong community support teachers stayed off the job for a week they settled for the same raise that the school district had offered at the outset and instead used their strike to win the hiring of a nurse in every school a reduction of class sizes the extension of a program that exempts schools from administering random searches of their students and a cap on the spread of charter schools innovative organizing and bargaining initiatives have not remained confined to the public sector by 2016 the communications workers of america cwa the committee for better banks and allied organizations laid the groundwork for organizing to improve pay and benefits for the nation s more than one million non union bank workers employing a common good approach similar to that pioneered by teachers unions this coalition positioned itself as a defender of consumers and an opponent of predatory financial practices it began demanding an end to the sales goals and metrics that force bank workers to sell predatory financial products as a condition of employment and more broadly to reform the finance system so that it serves the people instead of operating as a driver of inequality wells fargo workers connected to this campaign acted as the whistleblowers who exposed the bank s cheating scandals in 2016 bank workers at santander a spanish based multinational bank that is the leader in the u s subprime auto loan market have helped expose their employer s predatory practices these campaigns show how bank workers can help regulate their industry from below exposing and stopping banks from cheating consumers and engaging in practices that threaten the broader health of the economy innovative organizing and bargaining initiatives have not remained confined to the public sector two recent victories illustrate this tim sloan the ceo of wells fargo was forced to resign after congressional hearings where he was confronted by wells fargo workers who blew the whistle on wells fargo s reinstitution of toxic sales goals the was followed by bank of american increasing the minimum pay for bank workers to 20 00 an hour meeting one of the dmands of cwa and the committee for better banks the titans of private equity have also presented a promising target for labor activists particularly since such firms control a range of companies in multiple sectors and nations consider the blackstone group the world s largest private equity firm that controls 150 companies with a combined value of more than 400 billion and 600 000 workers blackstone is the largest owner of office space in the world the world s largest private owner of real estate the largest owner of logistics companies in europe and the world s largest investor in hedge funds activism around blackstone offers an example of how diverse campaigns targeting one such firm can be run at once tying together a variety of issues and organizations to challenge the full scope of the company s activities organizers are planning campaigns that would mount drives at the non union companies blackstone owns form a tenant union of blackstone renters and prevail on union pension funds to use their leverage to prevent blackstone from foreclosing on homes in post hurricane puerto rico at the same time union allies are preparing legislation in several states that would tax private equity executives to recover the states shares of the billions in tax revenue that are lost to the carried interest loophole that protects the hyper wealthy executives of private equity giants even amazon has not been impervious to pressure from workers and their allies perhaps the most difficult problem workers have faced in recent years is how to cope with the power of monopolistic corporations researchers have found that the rise of huge employers has led to the emergence of a monopsony in many labor markets where those employers set wages artificially low without fear of competition for workers no big employer has come to symbolize the problem more than amazon which pays its warehouse and delivery workers poverty wages even as it wrings tax incentives from the local communities where it builds its distribution centers creative challenges to amazon s power began to emerge by 2018 somali immigrants make up a huge slice of amazon s warehouse employees in the twin cities in 2018 many of those workers began organizing through the awood center an east african workers center to demand a voice in determining their workload regular consultations with community representatives prayer time on the job among other things in october 2018 amazon announced their minimum wage increase to 15 the company didn t have a set wage beforehand so the raises for workers ranged from a few dollars to nothing and as it raised the minimum wage the company also cut bonuses and stock options for existing warehouse workers the wage increase still does not address core issues leading to very high turnover including excessive hours and pace of work at the same time activists in many of the cities amazon induced into bidding for the siting of amazon s hq2 facility actively opposed tax giveaways and subsidies that their city leaders were offering to the nation s richest company contending that amazon s arrival would drive up housing costs and increase inequality they also objected to the undemocratic and secretive process through which cities courted amazon opposition was so great to amazon s announcement that it would cite one of its hq2 centers in long island city new york that the company felt compelled to reverse its decision in february 2019 these campaigns are in their earliest stages they are as yet insufficient in scale scope and resources to challenge and win against the richest and most powerful corporate monopolies in history winning real power for workers at powerful giants such as amazon and walmart is likely still years away nonetheless these campaigns are first steps that offer a taste and glimpse of the role workers and their organizations could play in redistributing wealth and power and moving us toward real democratic socialism taken together they show that even as union density trended downward in the decade after the great recession and even as unions absorbed blows like the supreme court s decision in janus v afscme last year new and promising labor initiatives have been proliferating the traditionally bifurcated approach pursued by the u s labor movement bargaining on one hand political action on the other is failing on every level most importantly these campaigns have begun the work of radically re imagining and redefining the goals and mission of unions they have either implicitly or explicitly broken with the traditionally bifurcated approach pursued by the u s labor movement for more than a century that approach held that workers should organize and bargain collectively to improve their wages benefits and working conditions and that they should pursue political and legislative action to win what they could not gain through collective bargaining it has become obvious that this approach is failing on every level having been largely blocked from winning significant gains either through organizing and bargaining or through the pursuit of pursuing electoral and legislative strategies workers and their organizations have increasingly turned to a more unified approach tying bargaining more closely to politics bargaining for the common good campaigns have shown that by consciously politicizing their organizing bargaining and strikes workers can start to feel and demonstrate the potential power of a movement that is committed to democracy at work in our communities states and country as a whole the teacher strikes have shown workers that they might win through job actions what they do not win through legislative or political action and the amazon hq2 campaign subverted the long standing assumption that secret taxpayer funded corporate subsidies were effective tools to promote economic development they suggest that the idea of collective bargaining that had emerged in the twentieth century is being redefined and repurposed in promising ways that challenge the erosion of democracy and the rise of inequality in the years to come we believe that the workplace centered economism that was characteristic of trade union based social democracies or new deal america will yield to broader forms of organization social bargaining and democratic experiment the inescapable fact that work relations in twenty first century capitalism are intimately connected to the structure of communities social institutions and lived environments points in that direction so do efforts to win justice for workers across lines of gender race and citizenship status winning bargaining power for workers and raising wages will inevitably be connected to efforts to defend public schools and mass transit create affordable housing repulse predatory finance and combat climate change these campaigns have begun the work of radically re imagining and redefining the goals and mission of organizing this is a vision with deep american roots recent efforts recall the vibrancy that characterized u s labor struggles in the era before the twentieth century institutionalization of unions and traditional collective bargaining from the lowell female labor reform association s resistance to wage slavery in the new england factory towns of the early nineteenth century to the community based assemblies of the knights of labor that took power in small towns like rochester new hampshire in the 1880s to the sewer socialism of milwaukee or schenectady in the progressive era unions of the past had concerned themselves not merely with wages and hours of their members but with a defense of the common good and the construction of a cooperative commonwealth labor s crisis is leading unions to rediscover elements of that american heritage and update it for the needs of this century it is now for us to take up that urgent work democracy cannot co exist with the overweening power of the likes of amazon walmart and blackstone any more than it could co exist with what lincoln era republicans called the slave power as louis d brandeis is said to have observed and as we have relearned painfully in our time we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both

michael yates focuses on us labor may day is one of the most important days to the exploited people michael d yates director of monthly review press and former associate editor of monthly review magazine focuses on us labor and its movement in the following interview from april 2019 by farooque chowdhury professor michael yates whose academic fields are labor economics and the relationship between capital and labor also discusses labor s new initiatives at grass roots level defying and contesting official labor leadership farooque chowdhury you have been closely associated with labor in the united states for more than 30 years you have worked as a labor educator as negotiator representing unions as union organizer and as labor activist moreover you have covered labor widely in your articles and books based on these interactions and experiences please tell us about the present state of labor in the us michael yates if we look at some data we see that from a numerical standpoint the u s labor movement is weak union density the fraction of wage and salary workers who are in unions is low in january 2019 it was 10 5 percent in 1983 the rate was 20 1 percent and although the rates are not perfectly comparable for earlier years when the data collection was not the same at the time of the merger of the country s two largest labor federations the american federation of labor afl and the congress of industrial organization cio in 1955 the fraction of workers in unions was much higher probably in the neighborhood of 33 percent thus we see that there has been a long term decline in union density and this in a country that has historically had much lower percentages of union membership than almost every other rich capitalist country by comparison scandinavian nations have rates in excess of 60 percent with iceland over 90 percent even the absolute number of union members has been in decline over the past few years what is more the current union density hides the division between private sector and public sector workers in private employment a mere 6 4 percent of employees are unionized lower than it was more than 100 years ago while in the public sector the fraction is 33 9 percent however even in public employment rates have been falling and there is a widespread effort led by capital to make it difficult for public employees to unionize or maintain membership in existing unions public sector unions typically had contract clauses that compelled those who refused to join the union to still pay a dues equivalent to the union since they too would benefit from whatever the union won in the collective bargaining capital waged a long campaign through the courts to nullify such contract clauses employers achieved success when the supreme court of the united states ruled that compelling non members to pay dues was unconstitutional one last point with respect to public sector workers is that among the highest union densities is that for protective service employees these are police prison guards and the like persons who only by a stretch of the imagination should even be included in the working class given that their social role is to suppress workers these employees overwhelmingly serve capital unlike for example public school teachers transit workers and so forth another measure of the strength of the working class is the incidence of strikes there has been a marked decline in the number of strikes involving 1 000 workers or more these are called major work stoppages by the u s bureau of labor statistics which is the source of the data i have been citing in 2017 there were 7 of these involving 25 000 workers slightly higher than the all time low set in 2009 when there were a mere 5 such strikes with but 13 000 people out on strike the trend in major strikes has been markedly downward the last time there were more than 100 major strikes was in 1981 and the last year in which more than one million workers participated in major strikes was 1979 compare these numbers to earlier years between 1947 and 1979 there was only one year with fewer than 200 major strikes and years with at least 300 of these strikes were not that uncommon also between 1947 and 1979 32 years fewer than a million workers walked off the job in only 7 years the year 2018 did see a bit of an upsurge in major strikes due mainly to the aggressive actions of public school teachers in the states of west virginia kentucky arizona and california these strikes and a few others mainly by healthcare workers have shown that the strike tactic can still yield positive results as the strikers won significant wage and other increases the victories by teachers were the result of efforts by the rank and file to involve their communities and win their support for demanding better schools and education for the children of people in the communities what these actions give us is a bit more hope for the revival of a labor movement in the united states yet overall we are a long way from any sort of revival at the top of the internal hierarchies of most unions we have career bureaucrats interested mainly in their own advancement and security high salaries abound democracy is a rare commodity and statements of principles much less action on any set of principles rarer still unions are wedded to the democratic party which is at heart as much a party of capital as the utterly reactionary and proto fascist republican party unions cannot even come to strongly support the green new deal that the more liberal wing of the democratic party supports as part of an effort to come to grips with the destruction of mother nature now so well underway what is more the union chiefs are still supportive of u s imperialism i am afraid it will take more than rank and file protests to change things dramatically and in the direction of radical change fc what s the present condition of the u s labor movement my my answer to question 1 provides my overall view i will add here that the u s working class like those everywhere in the world is suffering from rising insecurity in employment fueled by many things including outsourcing of work laws and court rulings and sophisticated mechanization stagnant wages diminishing benefits such as health care pensions and paid leaves seemingly endless speed up at work invasive monitoring surveillance and drug testing unhealthful and unsafe working conditions and rising temperatures that make working outside increasingly dangerous workers feel politically impotent and all too often the unions they do have ignored them or worse collaborated with employers and engaged in corrupt practices we see the unhappiness of workers reflected in several trends remarkably high percentages of young persons ages 22 37 tell pollsters they are more favorable toward socialism than capitalism and many even identify themselves as democratic socialists much of this is due to the success that senator bernie sanders who identifies himself as a democratic socialist had his run for the democratic party s nominee for president of the united states in 2016 this was followed by the election to the u s house of representatives in 2018 of several persons mainly women and ethnic minorities who also declared themselves democratic socialists in addition a political organization the democratic socialists of america dsa has grown very rapidly over the past two year and now has in excess of 50 000 members impressive in a country such as the united states dsa members have supported many working class efforts including strikes housing struggles and environmental efforts that would greatly benefit workers such as the green new deal it must be noted that what most mean by socialism is not what was envisioned by marx and engels and millions of radicals throughout the world ever since the two great communists wrote and worked rather it is the social democracy that has marked mainly the scandinavian countries that is a well developed state financed social welfare system buttressed by strong labor unions hopefully as social democracy is found to be no longer possible as it is faltering even in those nations where it has been strongest working people will come to see that more radical struggle is needed there are some groups in the u s that do have a radical perspective such as philly socialists philly is slang for the city of philadelphia and they are deeply embedded in working class communities hopefully these organizations will grow and flourish unfortunately there are workers who are too demoralized to do anything political or even to form labor unions depression anxiety drug and alcohol abuse and suicide are growing more common and among working class white workers life expectancies are falling anger and resentment also find an outlet in neo fascist politics as evident from the fact that some workers avidly support the criminal and thoroughly anti working class administration of president trump trump has used his racism sexism and xenophobia to fuel widespread hatred for the other whether the other be black americans women or immigrants this rightward trend is troubling and the labor movement such as it is must address this forcefully unfortunately top labor union leaders met with trump soon after he took office and by no means all labor officials are as hostile to trump as they should be fc which parts of the working class dominate the labor movement in the us and what s the reason my in terms of power within the national labor federation the afl cio the most conservative unions mainly in the construction trades have power that belies their relatively small numbers these unions typically oppose anything that might threaten the jobs and high pay of their mainly white and male members such as the various oil pipeline schemes so detrimental to the environment they oppose any sort of green new deal as well several large industrial service and catchall many kinds of members from various sectors of the economy unions have influence based on their relatively large memberships these would include the teamsters union the service employees union the american federation of teachers and united autoworkers they might support more liberal policies and politicians but they are mired in bureaucracy hostile to the members interest full of careerists and often enough corrupt the real issue here is that there is no real labor movement to speak of plus overall membership is so low relative to the number of workers in the country that most laborers have no representation at all and even where there are specific working class movements such as the effort to win at least 15 per hour for fast food workers the leaders of such movements are all too often tied to the same bureaucratic and corrupt unions the only real hope it seems to me is for the mass of workers to forge new kinds of organizations see the question below on what unions should do for more details fc there are initiatives at the grassroots level in the us to go beyond or rise above the official establishment labor movement or labor leadership these seem to be sporadic and isolated most of these can t go that far but another part thrives what are the reasons behind all of this rise of new movement at grassroots level failures of a part of these and moving forward by the rest my the rise of new organizations and movements is due to the overall suffering of the mass of workers and the inadequacy of the current labor movement these are indeed often isolated but some like workers centers operating inside communities and usually built by immigrant workers have succeeded examples are the chinese staff and workers association in new york city the new york taxi drivers alliance and the coalition of immokalee workers in florida the last is an organization of farm workers mainly immigrants in these examples we find dedicated leadership a model based upon active members and real democracy careful planning of strategy and tactics and strong community support built up over longer periods of time the same rules for success apply as well to worker managed cooperatives and urban farming ventures an example worth studying is the cooperation jackson movement in the city of jackson mississippi here is what i wrote about this organization in my book can the working class change the world the movement in jackson is called cooperation jackson cj and it grew out of various efforts by blacks to build a socialist community in the heart of u s capitalism the rallying cry of the people who began cooperation jackson one of the most notable of these was black radical chokwe lumumba who eventually became jackson s mayor something remarkable in its own right was free the land after doing some preliminary organizing in the area they acquired land and began to develop an ambitious plan of eco socialist production distribution and education in the south global warming is going to inundate low lying areas with water this fact and the disaster in new orleans after hurricane katrina made these leaders grasp that any scheme that doesn t take ecology seriously cannot hope to change the world therefore cj maintained from the beginning that whatever they did had to be based upon the principle of sustaining the environment the cj project has four goals gaining black working class control of the means of production in jackson and the area close to it building and advancing the development of the ecologically regenerative forces of production making the working class the agent of combining the means of production into socially useful outputs and democratically transforming jackson and then the state of mississippi and outward to the entire south cj has started cooperatives a cooperative school training center union and bank farms and grocery stores are an integral part of cooperative production there is much more to cj including the use of technologies like 3d printers to make useful goods the development of substantive political democracy and eco friendly public infrastructure the industrialization plan is particularly ambitious it can be criticized as not feasible but in any conceivable future goods will have to be made using one technology or another cj by beginning to conceptualize this and then implementing it will help show the way forward movements such as cooperation jackson may hold the key to the building of a radical labor movement in the united states one concerned with all aspects of working class life and willing to engage in militant collective self help activities fc what obstacles do these grassroots movements of labor in the us face my there is the problem of funding it is best to have members fund activities whenever possible with solicitations from ordinary people supplementing the group s treasury reliance on existing labor unions or ngos is usually a mistake because such monies never come without strings attached there is also the problem of antagonism from capital and the state which will become worse the more successful the grassroots movement is there is the problem of developing grassroots experts for all the technical work and organizing that has to be done there is the problem of burnout from long hours and poor living conditions there is the problem of turnover in the membership as people move away out of economic necessity deportations in the case of undocumented workers and the like there is the problem of internal ideological differences which can split a group apart finally any grassroots efforts must show some results quickly so that workers benefit and they must find ways to protect members from capital s efforts to destroy what they are doing fc what should be done now in this perspective by labor at grassroots level and by writers of labor literature my i have addressed this above when i wrote about what needs to be done to have a chance at success what writers can do is publicize all such efforts writing for those involved and not just about them also coalitions with other similar organizations are necessary and certainly education must be a primary component of any grassroots effort a membership that has learned its history the nature of the political economy the struggles needed and the obstacles that will be faced is more likely to succeed and more likely to have a radical perspective fc what impact has monopoly finance capital which has been identified and analyzed by john bellamy foster and fred magdoff made on labor in the us my well monopoly finance capital has certainly increased the overall power of capital and this by definition will inevitably harm the working class specifically two things come to mind first as businesses are taken over by finance capital they are seen merely as collections of assets to be squeezed for maximum immediate return debt will be piled up and assets stripped for money when as much money has been extracted as possible the corpse left will be left to rot all of this will result in shrinking employment lower wages reduced or eliminated benefits and more unsafe working conditions finance capital works much like gangsters who do the same things when they use direct violence to take over a business second monopoly finance capital has meant the elimination of whatever autonomy the states of capitalist countries once had states are now adjuncts of finance capital and states are now run according to strict market principles the state s assets are stripped too the result being a diminution of both public employment and public services everyone is presumed to be on his or her own and no one will offer help the rich will continually get richer and workers will suffer more and more good reasons for the working class to finally develop a radical consciousness and get rid of this insidious system once and for all one more point bears consideration monopoly finance capital with its relentlessly short term horizon acts in such a way that financial bubbles become inevitable as witnessed by the housing bubble and crisis that struck the united states and then much of the world in 2007 these bubbles when they burst generate economic slowdowns which now have become deep recessions that wreak havoc on working class life fc has capital s capacity in the us to bribe workers eroded if it has eroded has monopoly finance capital played a role in the erosion if not then is the bribing going on as usual my it is not so much that this capacity has eroded what has happened and see the previous question is that capital no longer has to bribe labor which in the past it did from the super profits extracted from workers in the global south profits abound for capital in the global north however labor is now so weak and disorganized and capital so strong that workers do not have to be bribed to support northern capital as they in effect were in the past some workers support capital without any monetary advantage and the rest are so habituated to the system that they do not know how to mount an attack on capital super profits have always helped to finance the states in the global north through taxation but now even the state offers labor no protection tax revenues can be and are used to buttress capital s profits and power this situation will continue to prevail until such time as there is a united global and radical labor movement to challenge it fc automation is creeping in unionization rates are falling what s the impact of automation on labor in the us my automation robotization and other types of mechanization always lowers employment at least in the sectors most immediately affected and thus increases the reserve army of labor this reserve is now global in scope and mechanization occurs everywhere in the world this reserve puts downward pressure on wages and every other condition of employment and it generates some new and old types of employment that rely heavily on labor as in service employment and work done from home automation also divides the working class into a tiny elite of scientific workers and everyone else causing growing wage inequality which itself impedes labor solidarity often enough just the threat of automation like the threat of moving operations to other countries is enough to pressure workers into submission automation by allowing for greater surveillance of workers and building what was once employee knowledge into the machines themselves greatly enhances managerial control in the workplace at the same time however automation may make production more sensitive to disruption just as complex supply chains and logistics do but this requires that workers understand this are organized and willing to disrupt production the irony is that under a different socialist system more sophisticated technology developed for the people rather than against them could greatly ease the burden of many kinds of onerous employment and give rise to much shorter working hours and freedom for each of us to fully develop our capacities i might add that profits derive from the exploitation of living labor and not from machines themselves given this the idea of a fully automated society is science fiction machines would have to build and program machines and there would be in the end no living labor to exploit automation would automatically end capitalism this is an unlikely scenario fc are trade war s making any impact on labor my trade is always a matter of politics and never just a matter of obvious and shared economic advantage thus given that almost all governments and certainly that of the united states are now servants of capital trade agreements will always benefit corporations and hurt workers such was the case with the north american free trade agreement which harmed workers in all three signatory nations the united states canada and mexico although no doubt mexican workers and peasants suffered most president trump has begun trade wars with many countries in part to satisfy his anti immigrant and xenophobic base these may upset markets and in that way damage workers in affected industries ironically they also might hurt the bottom line of those economic sectors impacted most by tariffs and quotas for example trade wars with china mean that soybean farmers in the central united states will lose lucrative export markets so far trump has always backed away from doing the damage he could do no doubt because of protests from powerful capitalists his base is largely ignorant of the nuts and bolts of this so he can always claim he acted tough with the foreign countries he claims are out to get the united states full scale trade wars can lead to real wars so there is always a danger of that and it is still true that corporations are headquartered and protected in the united states so there is competition among national capitals despite the fact that production is now so global so states will always be keen to protect their national capitals from a working class perspective the struggle should be for as much worker controlled and localized production as possible if for no other reason than that trade is very damaging to the environment and wreaks havoc on the poorest workers and peasants worldwide fc factional fights within the us ruling class are surfacing sometimes in ugly crude and dangerous form the fight at times is questioning the credibility of a number of very essential institutions of class rule the factions engaged in intra class conflict are questioning its news information views media the mainstream media or the imperialist media in whatever way these are identified its external adventures interventions and aggressions in other lands are facing debacles its credibility and that of its media are declining today its audience accepts little of whatever the msm report is there any impact of these on the labor in the us my i wouldn t put too much emphasis on ruling class splits of course there are capitalists opposed to trump however in the end they will accept him because he has been good for their profits tax cuts for example which overwhelmingly benefit capital the most the situation may be different in other countries but here i don t see any segments of capital ready to revolt in addition as the democratic party has shifted significantly to the right the center of political gravity overall in the united states has also shifted dramatically to the right given that the republican party is to the extreme right trump is an evil maniac without a shred of morality or compassion and he is doing things most of us naively i think couldn t imagine happening and yet the mainstream media have profited mightily from trump s insanity with ratings going up every time they report on a new trump scandal the real danger is the rise of neo fascism with its inherent drive to annihilate the other it is possible to imagine that this will continue with or without trump the capitalist class is facing unprecedented crises foremost among them ecological catastrophe it faces constant wars too although capital has never vehemently opposed wars including the war on terror there will soon enough be hundreds of millions of climate and war refugees seeking shelter beset by unprecedented inequality which they don t mind for now given that they have gotten so much money as wealth and income move from the bottom to the top the rich will find it hard to hide what will they do demand more democracy and better media a more educated population i don t see this they will want the state to crack the whip and they will and are now build private fortified and heavily policed enclaves for themselves a society run on market principles must have violence at its beck and call this is really what fascism is all about only an aroused working class allied with peasants has any chance of stopping this fc the us ruling class is vigorously marketing divisive sectarian medieval politics what s the impact of this on labor in the us and what s to be done by the labor movement my the working class in the united states is divided along many dimensions skill location education wage rates religion gender ethnicity country of origin and race among others among these gender ethnicity and race are most important the capitalist political economy here has been patriarchal and racist from its beginning the latter is the result of a vicious slavery that built the economy not just through the production of cotton but from the slave generated money that helped to fuel and in fact led the country s industrial revolution the unpaid labor of women in the home has been a gift to capital and women could be drawn into market based production when needed and discarded when not employers soon discovered that race and gender could be used to split workers fomenting competition rather than solidarity among them this has been done by the allocation of job with racial and ethnic minorities and women given the worst jobs and white men the best this along with constant racist and sexist propaganda soon gave rise to the notion that these groups deserved their fate i have written much about this and refer readers to can the working class change the world here however consider some of the results of racism a brief look at some data from the united states shows the remarkable disparities between black and white members of the working class median black family income is barely 60 percent that of whites a little more than ten percentage points higher than it was in 1949 black median household net worth is just 5 percent that of whites blacks earn less than whites at all levels of education astonishingly a 10 000 increase in the average annual wage of an occupation is associated with a seven percentage point decrease in the proportion of black men in that occupation besides earnings when we consider poverty unemployment health education housing life expectancy infant mortality or the criminal justice system we must conclude that having a black skin in and of itself is a grave economic and social disadvantage while having a white skin confers considerable advantage there have been forces within the u s labor movement that have actively combated the divisions in the working class sometimes with success usually these forces have been radical the communist party in the 1930s is a good example the left led labor unions purged from the cio during the anti communist hysteria of the late 1940s often did the same however much more needs to be done statements of principles of no toleration for racism and sexism by the afl cio and all individual unions are essential as is action to back these up collective bargaining agreements with strong no discrimination clauses and a willingness to strike picket and boycott over employer violations are necessary support for feminist and anti racist groups in the larger society is a must as is active participation in the protests and actions of black lives matter and similar groups promotion of caucuses of women black workers and ethnic groups as well as lgbtq workers could give these groups of oppressed workers a strong voice in every labor organization militant actions on the political front are badly needed general strikes to support immigrants oppose the rise of fascist groups and the like would show a real commitment to equality fc is there any impact of the present condition of and trends within the labor movement in the us on the labor movements in other countries my historically u s organized labor has been all too often an adjunct of u s foreign policy opposing left wing unions and movements around the world therefore it has been rare for the u s labor movement to have a positive much less a radical impact on workers movements in other countries anti imperialism and opposition to u s led wars on poor countries has never been very strong in the u s labor movement this is still the case things may change as workers especially younger ones are drawn to social democracy however even in social democratic organizations a u s first view is common and a neglect of what is going on in the rest of the world is as well another positive development is the greater radicalism and willingness to organize and join unions of newly arrived immigrants into the united states hopefully these immigrants will along with black and other oppressed workers succeed in building a labor movement with an international working class perspective fc what are your suggestions proposals to labor as a whole and to the labor defying official leadership to deal with the reality that you have pictured in the answers above my here is a long quote from my book can the working class change the world that i think answers this question labor unions have been a principal response by workers to capital s exploitation they are necessary defense agents and as long as capitalism exists they will form if unions mirror corporations in their structures which all too many do there isn t much hope that they will confront capital and this is all the more the case if they have entered into a compact with employers that views the two sides as cooperators interested primarily in the profitability of the owners businesses this strategy has failed the proof being in the deteriorating working conditions and life circumstances of union members and the sharp drop in union densities during the period in which partnership has marked much of the labor movement worldwide to begin to reverse course then labor unions must become democratic run by the membership and they must abandon labor management cooperation schemes since it is unlikely that current leaders will seek to do either of these things the only way forward is to get rid of the leadership in the united states a perusal of the magazine labor notes shows that there have been frequent attempts by rank and file activists to take control of their unions and put them on a democratic and militant path a few have been successful most have not no doubt the fear of such insurgencies has made some unions willing to mobilize members and take on the companies with strikes picketing and boycotts but reform has proved a daunting task similar to efforts by political advocates to move the democratic party to the left those in power seldom want to relinquish control and they will be as ruthless as necessary to beat back rivals still labor rebellions have been successful at all levels of unions corrupt criminal leadership was defeated in both the teamsters and the united mine workers for example and though the rank and file victors were subsequently defeated or weakened neither union is as awful as it once was in addition sometimes revolt has taken the form of a new union one that breaks away from the parent organization or if a group of workers have no representation and no existing union is willing to help them organize they might establish an independent union again in the united states an example of the former is the national union of healthcare workers nuhw tired of the service employees international union s seiu top down management its embrace of labor management cooperation and sweetheart deals with employers its frequent impositions of trusteeships the national union takes over the running of a local union on recalcitrant locals with rebellious and independent leaders and outright corruption the nuhw broke away from seiu in 2009 before asking what a democratic union looks like and what it should do it is proper to say that there are now unions that work in a democratic manner in the united states the best example is the united electrical workers an independent labor union that has the distinction of being kicked out of both the afl and the cio its national office and locals rest on the will of the members it does not make deals with employers and it has never been tainted with corruption officer salaries and expenses are strictly controlled and its constitution is a model of democratic principles that the union has adhered to through good times and bad other u s unions have served their members well too the overall trajectory however has been toward bureaucratic undemocratic structures and an increasingly unwarranted faith in labor capital compromise democracy means more than voting the structure of the union must be democratic there should be direct ballot casting by all the members for any office as opposed to convention delegates usually chosen by the leadership voting for those same leaders as is common in many u s unions term limits for officers are essential no advantage of any kind should be proffered to incumbents seeking reelection strict limits should be placed on the salaries of union officers and a careful open audit of expenses should be routine the rank and file should participate in all union activities from planning for negotiations setting demands strike preparation and the striking and picketing union meetings should be open to all members especially those with home responsibilities almost always women and also held at convenient times meeting discussions should be open and criticisms should be welcomed and debated special attention should be paid in all aspects of the union to the concerns and needs of racial and ethnic minorities as well as lgbt members retirees should be encouraged to take part in all union actions if a rank and file uprising is successful a breakaway union is founded or an independent union is created and even if these result in more democracy it is still necessary to ask democracy for what what are the principles and goals of the organization the nuhw lists these as its core beliefs a strong union is led by its members worker power is the foundation of a just society quality patient care requires that caregivers have a voice in their workplaces and are protected from retaliation healthcare is a human right this is a good preliminary set of principles but more needs to be said and done first education must be a priority compulsory classes should greet new members teaching them about the union s history and that of the labor movement as a whole and regular short courses summer schools and longer learning experiences should be made available with at least some courses required to maintain membership in these classes the construction of a broader array of principles and aspirations can be developed several come to mind an examination of racism and patriarchy the objectives here are ending discrimination in the union building greater solidarity compelling the employer to behave in a nondiscriminatory manner and leading the union to play a positive role in combating these divisions in the community and society a study of imperialism and militarism for unions in the global north the purpose of this would be to build an understanding of the role of their governments and employers in subjugating the peoples of the global south and of the past complicity of unions in this a radical labor movement cannot become a reality unless it is adamantly opposed to imperial wars arms production and sales the infiltration of the military into local economies and daily life the patriotism of flags and national anthems the mantra that we must all support the troops in the global north nationalism is a disease that impedes the global working class solidarity essential for human liberation unfortunately it is so deeply embedded in the institutional structure of capitalist society that the task of eliminating it is formidable yet if the effort isn t made there is no hope of the working class changing the world a serious discussion of the multiple environmental crises we face if these aren t working class issues what are global warming is a workplace issue ecology professor and writer andreas malm writes physical labour makes the body warm if it takes place under the sun or inside facilities without advanced air conditioning systems excessively high temperatures will make the sweat flow more profusely and the bodily powers sag until the worker suffers heat exhaustion or worse this will not be an ordeal for the average software developer or financial adviser but for people who pick vegetables build skyscrapers pave roads drive buses sew clothes in poorly ventilated factories or mend cars in slum workshops it already is and the bulk of exceptionally hot working days are now anthropogenic in nature with every little rise in average temperatures on earth thermal conditions in millions of workplaces around the world shift further primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions where the majority of the working population some four billion people live their days for every degree a greater chunk of output will be lost estimated to reach more than a third of total production after four degrees in this heat workers simply cannot keep up the same pace given the magnitude of impending disasters labor must make the environment a major concern this means opposing all corporate and public actions that exacerbate global warming the poisoning of air soil and water and the extinction of species among others when construction unions lobby for ruinous shale oil pipelines as happened in the united states other unions must speak out and condemn such self serving deeds as democratic unions strengthen and their principles and goals become more class conscious they will naturally ally themselves with like minded unions and community groups in this way a labor movement worthy of the name can begin and grow one concerned with the entirety of the working class including those in the reserve army of labor and the informal sector a union s most important immediate concern is with its members welfare here the question of democracy for what can take concrete form labor management cooperation should be immediately and permanently rejected replaced by an adversarial relationship that makes no concessions to management instead the union makes demands that challenge capital s control of the workplace higher wages are always on the table but so must be shorter hours more paid time off full parental leave for both parents for at least a few months a safe and nontoxic work environment active union participation in decisions related to both technology and work intensity an unrestricted right to strike over any issue a shortened grievance resolution procedure with rank and file participation at all levels the right not to cross picket lines while on employer related business and high monetary penalties for plant closures and relocations whatever makes laboring less alienated and weakens capital s control should be vigorously and relentlessly pursued unions should never allow the employer to play one plant off against another much less cooperate in this as the united auto workers has done strong protections for women and racial and ethnic minorities should be part of every contract when a union faces a multi plant employer or more than one employer it should organize coordinated communications and tactics among the officers on the shop floor office or store solidarity must be more than a word and an injury to any worker should anger every sister and brother fc what do you suggest to read study to learners like me interested to know about labor my two of my books might be useful can the working class change the world and why unions matter others that are good are any book by kim moody his last is titled on new terrain steve early

reviving the strike and strike back show the necessity and usefulness of strikes jane slaughter s a troublemaker s handbook has great advice for making trouble for the bosses labor notes the magazine jane helped to found is devoted to reporting on strikes and rank and file efforts to democratize their unions as well as the overall state of the u s labor movement priscilla murolo s from the folks

uk has been given a deadline to leave the eu which is later in the autumn but the commission president might be elected before that it looks very messy at the moment he added we have to make sure all meps have the same rights and responsibilities because we cannot be in a situation where some meps have a partial mandate but a temporary majority may cause lots of questions and troubles ecb de guindos interest rates to stay low even once monetary policy normalizes ecb vice president luis de guindos reiterated the central bank s accommodative stance in an event in london today he said the low interest rate environment is with us for the foreseeable future and is caused in large part by durable structural factors he added even once monetary policy normalizes interest rates are likely to remain below levels that were common in previous decades on brexit he said i hope we will be able to take advantage of the new period of time that british government parliament have at its disposable

overview the may day holiday has shut most markets in asia and europe making for subdued market action equity markets that are open like australia and the uk advanced and us shares are trading higher helped by apple s upbeat forecasts and sales that beat expectations indeed there is a risk that the s p 500 gaps higher at the open after closing on the highs of the day which were a new record the us dollar is narrowly mixed but mostly softer the new zealand dollar is a notable exception disappointing employment growth boosts the chances of a rate cut next week the federal reserve though is the central bank of the day president trump s demand for a rate where he says a 100 bp would see growth surge is likely to fall on deaf ears the market hardly flinched at the latest tweets asia pacific many were already looking for a rate cut next week by the reserve bank of new zealand and the weaker employment report fans such expectations the decline in the unemployment rate 4 2 vs 4 3 was the result of a sharp decline in the participation rate 70 4 vs 70 9 the most important takeaway was the 0 2 decline in q1 employment the median forecast in the bloomberg survey called for a 0 5 gains after a 0 1 increase in q4 18 private wages with and without bonus payments increased by 0 3 which were also slower than expected 0 5 both the forward market and the ois imply that about a 60 chance of a cut next week has been discounted south korean exports fell for the fifth consecutive month in march but the 2 year over year decline was almost a third of the decline that the median forecast anticipated weakness in semiconductors 0 9 continued but there were a small uptick memory chip exports imports were also stronger than expected rising 2 4 compared with forecasts of a 1 0 decline us china trade talks are thought to be entering the final stages and there is still hope that an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks and that a meeting between the two presidents is possible toward the end of the month the financial times reports today that trump has softened the language demanding that china stop its commercial cyber theft this plays into fears that trump is mostly interested in transactional short term benefits rather than deeper structural reforms reports indicate that china is resistance us demands to change its industrial policy including its industry subsidies recall that at the end of last week fbi director wray warned that china had pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovations and that all of the 56 fbi field offices are conducting economic espionage investigations across most industries that almost invariably lead to china separately china announced its intention to remove limits on foreign ownership of local banks and make it easier for foreign insurance firms to enter the on shore market the dollar has been confined to less than a fifth of a yen range within the ranges seen yesterday the five day average slipped below the

the next technical target is close to 1 3125 america there is no reason to expect a shift in the fed s posture it remains on hold as it patiently awaits clearer economic signals the central bank s economic assessment contained in the first part of the fomc statement needs to be tweaked to recognize some stronger growth impulses in q1 yet concerns will remain as the private sales to domestic parties which strips away inventories net exports and government was the weakest in a few years the jobs market remains robust and there seems to be an increasing shortage of unskilled and lightly skilled workers investors will learn friday whether this shortage is boosting wage pressures rather than its full employment mandate it is the stable price objective that is proving more difficult price pressures remain modest the gdp price deflator was halved to 0 9 year over year from 1 7 in q4 18 the march pce deflator slowed to 1 3 from 1 4 there is some confusion but this rather than the core rate is what the fed targets at 2 0 here is a price pressures remain modest the gdp price deflator was halved to 0 9 year over year from 1 7 in q4 18 the march pce deflator slowed to 1 3 from 1 4 there is some confusion but this rather than the core rate is what the fed targets at 2 0 here is a link to the fed s statement on long run goals and monetary policy strategy where it is clearly stated note that the 2 10 year yield curve has doubled to about 24 bp since march 22 it is the steepest since last november the steepening though can be mostly accounted for by the decline in the 2 year yield 15 bp which itself is a function of the market pricing in a greater chance of a fed cut before the end of the year the implied yield of the january fed funds futures contract has eased 12 bp or about 80 of the decline in the two year yield on the eve of the fomc decision president trump has doubled down on his criticism of the fed and called for a 100 bp rate cut in rates this is twice the size of the cut kudlow and moore have advocated the market barely blinked in response separately the chances of moore s approval had looked reasonable about a week ago but the latest revelations have weakened his position the magic number is four given the 52 48 seat majority that the republicans have in the senate a loss more than three votes doom the nomination three gop senators now seem reluctant to confirm moore if presented with a formal nomination there is also a debate over whether trump s criticism of the fed or his dollar comments reflect a new norm or whether trump is regarded as a case to himself we suspect the latter but time will be the judge the us dollar moved below cad1 34 yesterday and in so doing has now re entered its previous trading range against all the major currencies this seemed to reflect the us dollar weakness more than the strength of the canadian dollar indeed canada s news yesterday including an unexpected contracted 0 1 in february s monthly gdp

the 2018 mineral reserves and resource statement released in february 2019 the company s long term strategic objective is to generate increasing cash flow through low cost production growth from its existing operations and portfolio of development projects since 2014 alamos has transformed from a single asset producer with 140 000 ounces of annualized production to producing over 500 000 ounces in 2018 this transformational growth has been accomplished while also improving margins through lower operating costs looking forward the company anticipates a substantial reduction in growth capital in 2020 and beyond and a further reduction in costs which will lead to strong free cash flow growth the company is on track to achieve 2019 guidance with a strong first quarter performance including production of 125 300 ounces at lower than budgeted total cash costs of 732 per ounce the company expects production and total cash costs to be in a similar range in the second quarter with all in sustaining costs expected to increase reflecting the timing of sustaining capital spending costs are expected to decline in the second half of 2019 driving stronger mine site free cash flow towards the end of the year the near term focus at young davidson remains on maximizing efficiency from the upper mine infrastructure while completing development and construction of the lower mine gold production in the first quarter of 45 000 ounces and mining rates of 6 540 tpd were consistent with guidance young davidson is expected to produce between 180 000 to 190 000 ounces in 2019 total cash costs and mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to decrease 6 compared to 2018 driven by higher underground mining rates and grades mined as the lower mine expansion nears completion approximately three months of downtime of the northgate shaft is required to facilitate the tie in of the upper and lower mines accordingly and as previously guided gold production from young davidson is expected to be lower in the first half of 2020 following completion of the tie in underground mining rates are expected to ramp up above 7 500 tpd in the second half of 2020 this is expected to drive annual gold production above 200 000 ounces per year in 2021 and beyond this production increase combined with declining costs and capital spending is expected to result in strong free cash flow growth from young davidson starting in the second half of 2020 island gold started the year strong with record quarterly production of 35 600 ounces up 23 from the previous record set in the fourth quarter of 2018 further island gold generated 16 6 million in free cash flow in the first quarter net of all capital and exploration spending reflecting the high grade nature of the island gold deposit island gold is expected to produce between 135 000 to 145 000 ounces in 2019 a 33 increase from 2018 the increase in production reflects higher grades and throughput with the completion of the phase i expansion last year combined with decreasing costs island gold is expected to generate strong free cash flow growth in 2019 net of a continued significant investment of 19 million in exploration to further expand mineral reserves and resources the phase i expansion at island gold was completed in 2018 expanding the mill to a design capacity of approximately 1 200 tpd the current mine infrastructure can support similar mining rates however the operation is currently permitted to operate at an average annual rate of 1 100 tpd with a mine and mill that can support higher throughput rates the company is in the process of permitting a phase ii expansion to 1 200 tpd which is expected to be complete by the end of 2019 in parallel the company is evaluating a phase iii expansion of the operation beyond 1 200 tpd total production from the mulatos district was on budget in the first quarter and is expected to be between 150 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold in 2019 consistent with long term guidance provided last year mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to range between 860 and 900 per ounce and reflect the end of the 5 royalty which was achieved in march 2019 construction of the higher grade high return cerro pelon project is advancing on schedule with initial low cost production expected in 2020 mining activities ceased at el chanate in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the operation has transitioned to residual leaching which is anticipated to result in a declining rate of production through 2019 mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to average 1 200 per ounce in 2019 with approximately 25 of those costs having been already incurred with the receipt of the operating permit at kirazlı construction activities will be ramping up through the remainder of the year driving the bulk of development capital spending in 2019 the majority of the remaining development capital spending will be comprised of capitalized exploration at island gold and exploration permitting and development activities at lynn lake the 2019 global exploration budget is 33 million with 19 million allocated for exploration at island gold mulatos and lynn lake remain the other two areas of focus with 6 million budgeted for each with approximately 580 million of cash and available liquidity no debt and growing cash flow from its

first quarter of 2018 mill throughput of 609 927 tonnes or 6 777 tpd was lower than the comparative quarter and annual guidance due to deferral of processing frozen low grade stockpile to warmer

as were underground mining costs of approximately cad 52 per tonne amortization of 454 per ounce was also consistent with the prior year period of 449 per ounce total cash costs of 839 per ounce in the first quarter were consistent with the comparative period but were above annual guidance as a result of lower grades mined and higher than anticipated underground maintenance costs mine site aisc were 1 068 per ounce in the first quarter up 7 from the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the timing of sustaining capital expenditures full year total cash costs and mine site aisc are both expected

reflecting a 22 increase in ounces sold cost of sales which includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense of 28 6 million were consistent with the comparative period as more ounces sold were offset by lower mining costs and lower amortization driving down cost of sales per ounce by 15 total cash costs were 497 per ounce in the first quarter a 10 improvement from the comparative quarter higher mining rates in 2019 resulted in lower underground mining costs per tonne total cash costs were consistent with guidance as mining rates and underground grades were in line

2019 in line with annual guidance this was down from the prior year period with mining from the san carlos underground deposit having ceased in the third quarter of 2018 mulatos is on track to achieve production and cost guidance for the year total tonnes mined in the first quarter were 22 lower than the prior year quarter due to an unexpected pit slope movement in the fourth quarter of 2018 of the el salto area of the open pit which temporarily impacted access to the mulatos pit the company is currently mining from both the mulatos and victor open pits in the first quarter the company completed

of 47 1 million were 12 5 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to lower concentrate ounces sold in 2019 with the completion of mining at the san carlos underground deposit in september of 2018 cost of sales which includes mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense were 33 8 million in the first quarter lower than the prior year period due to lower total tonnes mined in the open pit and fewer ounces sold amortization of 194 per ounce was in line with the prior year and below guidance total cash costs of 743 per ounce in the first quarter were lower than the prior year quarter and significantly below guided levels this outperformance on costs was the result of higher grades stacked in the quarter a lower operating waste to ore ratio and low cost ounces sold from concentrate during the first quarter the company recovered approximately 2 000 ounces in concentrate from the mill that were previously not expected to be recovered and had minimal associated inventory costs this had the impact of driving total cash costs at mulatos down significantly in the quarter the company does not expect cash costs to remain at these lower levels through the remainder of the year and maintains total cash cost guidance of 820 to 860 for the year mine site aisc of 809 per ounce in the first quarter were lower than the 842 per ounce reported in the prior year quarter due to timing of sustaining capital spending and lower cash costs the company does not expect mine site aisc to remain at these lower levels through the remainder of the year and maintains guidance of 860 to 900 for the year mulatos reported negative free cash flow of 12 0 million in the first quarter given higher growth capital spending on construction of cerro pelon and san carlos pre stripping activities mulatos paid the annual mining tax of 4 1 million and did not collect value added taxes in the first quarter both of which contributed to the cash out flow el chanate

primarily related to mapping and re logging and administrative costs including mineral concession payments exploration efforts are expected to ramp up in the second quarter lynn lake manitoba canada surface exploration drilling commenced at lynn lake during the first quarter of 2019 with a total of 4 585 m drilled in 17 holes drill holes were designed to test targets at the maclellan and gordon deposits with the objective of expanding mineral resources the results from the 2018 regional exploration program which included till sampling mapping and prospecting have been integrated into the lynn lake database these results are being interpreted in conjunction with the results of the airborne gravity gradiometer agg and magnetic survey with the objective of generating a pipeline of prospective targets across the lynn lake greenstone belt these targets will be the focus of regional exploration programs which will commence in the second quarter of 2019 spending in the first quarter totaled 0 9 million a total of 6 0 million comprised of 19 000 m of drilling is budgeted for the lynn lake project in 2019 review of first quarter financial results during the first quarter of 2019 the company sold 119 705 ounces of gold for total revenue of 156 1 million a decrease of 17 0 million or 10 compared to the prior year period this was driven by 8 lower gold sales in the quarter given the timing of shipments at quarter end as well as a 2 decrease in the average realized gold price the company s realized gold price of 1 304 per ounce was in line with the average london pm fix for the quarter cost of sales were 127 0 million in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease of 12 compared to the prior year period driven by lower mining and processing costs and lower amortization charges mining and processing costs were 82 2 million compared to 96 9 million in the prior year period this was due to less ounces sold and lower operating costs at both island gold and mulatos which drove down total cash costs for the quarter consolidated total cash costs for the quarter were 732 per ounce compared to 789 in the prior year period in the current year the company increased lower cost production at island gold which offset declining higher cost el chanate production in addition total cash costs at mulatos were significantly lower than guidance as the operation benefited from higher grades mined and unbudgeted production from concentrate aisc were 957 per ounce in the quarter a 2 increase from the prior year period primarily driven by the timing of sustaining capital spending at young davidson royalty expense was 5 4 million in the quarter consistent with the prior year period of 5 7 million as higher royalties at island gold were offset by lower royalties at mulatos royalty expense is expected to decrease in future quarters having achieved two million ounces of cumulative production at mulatos with the operation no longer subject to a third party 5 royalty amortization of 39 4 million in the quarter was lower than the prior year period expense of 42 1 million due to less ounces sold on a per ounce basis amortization of 329 was consistent with the prior year period of 324 and consistent with guidance the company expects amortization to average 345 per ounce in 2019 the company recognized earnings from operations of 18 7 million in the quarter consistent with the prior year period as lower gold sales were offset by improved margins in the quarter the company reported net earnings of 16 8 million in the quarter compared to 0 6 million in the same period of 2018 mainly driven by the impact of foreign exchange on tax expense on an adjusted basis earnings of 10 3 million or 0 03 per share for the quarter were consistent with

may day is one of the most important days to the exploited people michael d yates director of monthly review press and former associate editor of monthly review magazine focuses on us labor and its movement in the following interview taken in april 2019 by farooque chowdhury professor michael yates whose academic fields are labor economics and the relationship between capital and labor also discusses labor s new initiatives at grass roots level defying and contesting official labor leadership farooque chowdhury you have been closely associated with labor in the united states for more than 30 years you have worked as a labor educator as negotiator representing unions as union organizer and as labor activist moreover you have covered labor widely in your articles and books based on these interactions and experiences please tell us about the present state of labor in the us michael yates if we look at some data we see that from a numerical standpoint the u s labor movement is weak union density the fraction of wage and salary workers who are in unions is low in january 2019 it was 10 5 percent in 1983 the rate was 20 1 percent and although the rates are not perfectly comparable for earlier years when the data collection was not the same at the time of the merger of the country s two largest labor federations the american federation of labor afl and the congress of industrial organization cio in 1955 the fraction of workers in unions was much higher probably in the neighborhood of 33 percent thus we see that there has been a long term decline in union density and this in a country that has historically had much lower percentages of union membership than almost every other rich capitalist country by comparison scandinavian nations have rates in excess of 60 percent with iceland over 90 percent even the absolute number of union members has been in decline over the past few years what is more the current union density hides the division between private sector and public sector workers in private employment a mere 6 4 percent of employees are unionized lower than it was more than 100 years ago while in the public sector the fraction is 33 9 percent however even in public employment rates have been falling and there is a widespread effort led by capital to make it difficult for public employees to unionize or maintain membership in existing unions public sector unions typically had contract clauses that compelled those who refused to join the union to still pay a dues equivalent to the union since they too would benefit from whatever the union won in the collective bargaining capital waged a long campaign through the courts to nullify such contract clauses employers achieved success when the supreme court of the united states ruled that compelling non members to pay dues was unconstitutional one last point with respect to public sector workers is that among the highest union densities is that for protective service employees these are police prison guards and the like persons who only by a stretch of the imagination should even be included in the working class given that their social role is to suppress workers these employees overwhelmingly serve capital unlike for example public school teachers transit workers and so forth another measure of the strength of the working class is the incidence of strikes there has been a marked decline in the number of strikes involving 1 000 workers or more these are called major work stoppages by the u s bureau of labor statistics which is the source of the data i have been citing in 2017 there were 7 of these involving 25 000 workers slightly higher than the all time low set in 2009 when there were a mere 5 such strikes with but 13 000 people out on strike the trend in major strikes has been markedly downward the last time there were more than 100 major strikes was in 1981 and the last year in which more than one million workers participated in major strikes was 1979 compare these numbers to earlier years between 1947 and 1979 there was only one year with fewer than 200 major strikes and years with at least 300 of these strikes were not that uncommon also between 1947 and 1979 32 years fewer than a million workers walked off the job in only 7 years the year 2018 did see a bit of an upsurge in major strikes due mainly to the aggressive actions of public school teachers in the states of west virginia kentucky arizona and california these strikes and a few others mainly by healthcare workers have shown that the strike tactic can still yield positive results as the strikers won significant wage and other increases the victories by teachers were the result of efforts by the rank and file to involve their communities and win their support for demanding better schools and education for the children of people in the communities what these actions give us is a bit more hope for the revival of a labor movement in the united states yet overall we are a long way from any sort of revival at the top of the internal hierarchies of most unions we have career bureaucrats interested mainly in their own advancement and security high salaries abound democracy is a rare commodity and statements of principles much less action on any set of principles rarer still unions are wedded to the democratic party which is at heart as much a party of capital as the utterly reactionary and proto fascist republican party unions cannot even come to strongly support the green new deal that the more liberal wing of the democratic party supports as part of an effort to come to grips with the destruction of mother nature now so well underway what is more the union chiefs are still supportive of u s imperialism i am afraid it will take more than rank and file protests to change things dramatically and in the direction of radical change what s the present condition of the u s labor movement my answer to question 1 provides my overall view i will add here that the u s working class like those everywhere in the world is suffering from rising insecurity in employment fueled by many things including outsourcing of work laws and court rulings and sophisticated mechanization stagnant wages diminishing benefits such as health care pensions and paid leaves seemingly endless speed up at work invasive monitoring surveillance and drug testing unhealthful and unsafe working conditions and rising temperatures that make working outside increasingly dangerous workers feel politically impotent and all too often the unions they do have ignored them or worse collaborated with employers and engaged in corrupt practices we see the unhappiness of workers reflected in several trends remarkably high percentages of young persons ages 22 37 tell pollsters they are more favorable toward socialism than capitalism and many even identify themselves as democratic socialists much of this is due to the success that senator bernie sanders who identifies himself as a democratic socialist had his run for the democratic party s nominee for president of the united states in 2016 this was followed by the election to the u s house of representatives in 2018 of several persons mainly women and ethnic minorities who also declared themselves democratic socialists in addition a political organization the democratic socialists of america dsa has grown very rapidly over the past two year and now has in excess of 50 000 members impressive in a country such as the united states dsa members have supported many working class efforts including strikes housing struggles and environmental efforts that would greatly benefit workers such as the green new deal it must be noted that what most mean by socialism is not what was envisioned by marx and engels and millions of radicals throughout the world ever since the two great communists wrote and worked rather it is the social democracy that has marked mainly the scandinavian countries that is a well developed state financed social welfare system buttressed by strong labor unions hopefully as social democracy is found to be no longer possible as it is faltering even in those nations where it has been strongest working people will come to see that more radical struggle is needed there are some groups in the u s that do have a radical perspective such as philly socialists philly is slang for the city of philadelphia and they are deeply embedded in working class communities hopefully these organizations will grow and flourish unfortunately there are workers who are too demoralized to do anything political or even to form labor unions depression anxiety drug and alcohol abuse and suicide are growing more common and among working class white workers life expectancies are falling anger and resentment also find an outlet in neo fascist politics as evident from the fact that some workers avidly support the criminal and thoroughly anti working class administration of president trump trump has used his racism sexism and xenophobia to fuel widespread hatred for the other whether the other be black americans women or immigrants this rightward trend is troubling and the labor movement such as it is must address this forcefully unfortunately top labor union leaders met with trump soon after he took office and by no means all labor officials are as hostile to trump as they should be which parts of the working class dominate the labor movement in the us and what s the reason in terms of power within the national labor federation the afl cio the most conservative unions mainly in the construction trades have power that belies their relatively small numbers these unions typically oppose anything that might threaten the jobs and high pay of their mainly white and male members such as the various oil pipeline schemes so detrimental to the environment they oppose any sort of green new deal as well several large industrial service and catchall many kinds of members from various sectors of the economy unions have influence based on their relatively large memberships these would include the teamsters union the service employees union the american federation of teachers and united autoworkers they might support more liberal policies and politicians but they are mired in bureaucracy hostile to the members interest full of careerists and often enough corrupt the real issue here is that there is no real labor movement to speak of plus overall membership is so low relative to the number of workers in the country that most laborers have no representation at all and even where there are specific working class movements such as the effort to win at least 15 per hour for fast food workers the leaders of such movements are all too often tied to the same bureaucratic and corrupt unions the only real hope it seems to me is for the mass of workers to forge new kinds of organizations see the question below on what unions should do for more details there are initiatives at the grassroots level in the us to go beyond or rise above the official establishment labor movement or labor leadership these seem to be sporadic and isolated most of these can t go that far but another part thrives what are the reasons behind all of this rise of new movement at grassroots level failures of a part of these and moving forward by the rest the rise of new organizations and movements is due to the overall suffering of the mass of workers and the inadequacy of the current labor movement these are indeed often isolated but some like workers centers operating inside communities and usually built by immigrant workers have succeeded examples are the chinese staff and workers association in new york city the new york taxi drivers alliance and the coalition of immokalee workers in florida the last is an organization of farm workers mainly immigrants in these examples we find dedicated leadership a model based upon active members and real democracy careful planning of strategy and tactics and strong community support built up over longer periods of time the same rules for success apply as well to worker managed cooperatives and urban farming ventures an example worth studying is the cooperation jackson movement in the city of jackson mississippi here is what i wrote about this organization in my book can the working class change the world the movement in jackson is called cooperation jackson cj and it grew out of various efforts by blacks to build a socialist community in the heart of u s capitalism the rallying cry of the people who began cooperation jackson one of the most notable of these was black radical chokwe lumumba who eventually became jackson s mayor something remarkable in its own right was free the land after doing some preliminary organizing in the area they acquired land and began to develop an ambitious plan of eco socialist production distribution and education in the south global warming is going to inundate low lying areas with water this fact and the disaster in new orleans after hurricane katrina made these leaders grasp that any scheme that doesn t take ecology seriously cannot hope to change the world therefore cj maintained from the beginning that whatever they did had to be based upon the principle of sustaining the environment the cj project has four goals gaining black working class control of the means of production in jackson and the area close to it building and advancing the development of the ecologically regenerative forces of production making the working class the agent of combining the means of production into socially useful outputs and democratically transforming jackson and then the state of mississippi and outward to the entire south cj has started cooperatives a cooperative school training center union and bank farms and grocery stores are an integral part of cooperative production there is much more to cj including the use of technologies like 3d printers to make useful goods the development of substantive political democracy and eco friendly public infrastructure the industrialization plan is particularly ambitious it can be criticized as not feasible but in any conceivable future goods will have to be made using one technology or another cj by beginning to conceptualize this and then implementing it will help show the way forward movements such as cooperation jackson may hold the key to the building of a radical labor movement in the united states one concerned with all aspects of working class life and willing to engage in militant collective self help activities what obstacles do these grassroots movements of labor in the us face there is the problem of funding it is best to have members fund activities whenever possible with solicitations from ordinary people supplementing the group s treasury reliance on existing labor unions or ngos is usually a mistake because such monies never come without strings attached there is also the problem of antagonism from capital and the state which will become worse the more successful the grassroots movement is there is the problem of developing grassroots experts for all the technical work and organizing that has to be done there is the problem of burnout from long hours and poor living conditions there is the problem of turnover in the membership as people move away out of economic necessity deportations in the case of undocumented workers and the like there is the problem of internal ideological differences which can split a group apart finally any grassroots efforts must show some results quickly so that workers benefit and they must find ways to protect members from capital s efforts to destroy what they are doing what should be done now in this perspective by labor at grassroots level and by writers of labor literature i have addressed this above when i wrote about what needs to be done to have a chance at success what writers can do is publicize all such efforts writing for those involved and not just about them also coalitions with other similar organizations are necessary and certainly education must be a primary component of any grassroots effort a membership that has learned its history the nature of the political economy the struggles needed and the obstacles that will be faced is more likely to succeed and more likely to have a radical perspective what impact has monopoly finance capital which has been identified and analyzed by john bellamy foster and fred magdoff made on labor in the us well monopoly finance capital has certainly increased the overall power of capital and this by definition will inevitably harm the working class specifically two things come to mind first as businesses are taken over by finance capital they are seen merely as collections of assets to be squeezed for maximum immediate return debt will be piled up and assets stripped for money when as much money has been extracted as possible the corpse left will be left to rot all of this will result in shrinking employment lower wages reduced or eliminated benefits and more unsafe working conditions finance capital works much like gangsters who do the same things when they use direct violence to take over a business second monopoly finance capital has meant the elimination of whatever autonomy the states of capitalist countries once had states are now adjuncts of finance capital and states are now run according to strict market principles the state s assets are stripped too the result being a diminution of both public employment and public services everyone is presumed to be on his or her own and no one will offer help the rich will continually get richer and workers will suffer more and more good reasons for the working class to finally develop a radical consciousness and get rid of this insidious system once and for all one more point bears consideration monopoly finance capital with its relentlessly short term horizon acts in such a way that financial bubbles become inevitable as witnessed by the housing bubble and crisis that struck the united states and then much of the world in 2007 these bubbles when they burst generate economic slowdowns which now have become deep recessions that wreak havoc on working class life has capital s capacity in the us to bribe workers eroded if it has eroded has monopoly finance capital played a role in the erosion if not then is the bribing going on as usual it is not so much that this capacity has eroded what has happened and see the previous question is that capital no longer has to bribe labor which in the past it did from the super profits extracted from workers in the global south profits abound for capital in the global north however labor is now so weak and disorganized and capital so strong that workers do not have to be bribed to support northern capital as they in effect were in the past some workers support capital without any monetary advantage and the rest are so habituated to the system that they do not know how to mount an attack on capital super profits have always helped to finance the states in the global north through taxation but now even the state offers labor no protection tax revenues can be and are used to buttress capital s profits and power this situation will continue to prevail until such time as there is a united global and radical labor movement to challenge it automation is creeping in unionization rates are falling what s the impact of automation on labor in the us automation robotization and other types of mechanization always lowers employment at least in the sectors most immediately affected and thus increases the reserve army of labor this reserve is now global in scope and mechanization occurs everywhere in the world this reserve puts downward pressure on wages and every other condition of employment and it generates some new and old types of employment that rely heavily on labor as in service employment and work done from home automation also divides the working class into a tiny elite of scientific workers and everyone else causing growing wage inequality which itself impedes labor solidarity often enough just the threat of automation like the threat of moving operations to other countries is enough to pressure workers into submission automation by allowing for greater surveillance of workers and building what was once employee knowledge into the machines themselves greatly enhances managerial control in the workplace at the same time however automation may make production more sensitive to disruption just as complex supply chains and logistics do but this requires that workers understand this are organized and willing to disrupt production the irony is that under a different socialist system more sophisticated technology developed for the people rather than against them could greatly ease the burden of many kinds of onerous employment and give rise to much shorter working hours and freedom for each of us to fully develop our capacities i might add that profits derive from the exploitation of living labor and not from machines themselves given this the idea of a fully automated society is science fiction machines would have to build and program machines and there would be in the end no living labor to exploit automation would automatically end capitalism this is an unlikely scenario are trade war s making any impact on labor trade is always a matter of politics and never just a matter of obvious and shared economic advantage thus given that almost all governments and certainly that of the united states are now servants of capital trade agreements will always benefit corporations and hurt workers such was the case with the north american free trade agreement which harmed workers in all three signatory nations the united states canada and mexico although no doubt mexican workers and peasants suffered most president trump has begun trade wars with many countries in part to satisfy his anti immigrant and xenophobic base these may upset markets and in that way damage workers in affected industries ironically they also might hurt the bottom line of those economic sectors impacted most by tariffs and quotas for example trade wars with china mean that soybean farmers in the central united states will lose lucrative export markets so far trump has always backed away from doing the damage he could do no doubt because of protests from powerful capitalists his base is largely ignorant of the nuts and bolts of this so he can always claim he acted tough with the foreign countries he claims are out to get the united states full scale trade wars can lead to real wars so there is always a danger of that and it is still true that corporations are headquartered and protected in the united states so there is competition among national capitals despite the fact that production is now so global so states will always be keen to protect their national capitals from a working class perspective the struggle should be for as much worker controlled and localized production as possible if for no other reason than that trade is very damaging to the environment and wreaks havoc on the poorest workers and peasants worldwide factional fights within the us ruling class are surfacing sometimes in ugly crude and dangerous form the fight at times is questioning the credibility of a number of very essential institutions of class rule the factions engaged in intra class conflict are questioning its news information views media the mainstream media or the imperialist media in whatever way these are identified its external adventures interventions and aggressions in other lands are facing debacles its credibility and that of its media are declining today its audience accepts little of whatever the msm report is there any impact of these on the labor in the us i wouldn t put too much emphasis on ruling class splits of course there are capitalists opposed to trump however in the end they will accept him because he has been good for their profits tax cuts for example which overwhelmingly benefit capital the most the situation may be different in other countries but here i don t see any segments of capital ready to revolt in addition as the democratic party has shifted significantly to the right the center of political gravity overall in the united states has also shifted dramatically to the right given that the republican party is to the extreme right trump is an evil maniac without a shred of morality or compassion and he is doing things most of us naively i think couldn t imagine happening and yet the mainstream media have profited mightily from trump s insanity with ratings going up every time they report on a new trump scandal the real danger is the rise of neo fascism with its inherent drive to annihilate the other it is possible to imagine that this will continue with or without trump the capitalist class is facing unprecedented crises foremost among them ecological catastrophe it faces constant wars too although capital has never vehemently opposed wars including the war on terror there will soon enough be hundreds of millions of climate and war refugees seeking shelter beset by unprecedented inequality which they don t mind for now given that they have gotten so much money as wealth and income move from the bottom to the top the rich will find it hard to hide what will they do demand more democracy and better media a more educated population i don t see this they will want the state to crack the whip and they will and are now build private fortified and heavily policed enclaves for themselves a society run on market principles must have violence at its beck and call this is really what fascism is all about only an aroused working class allied with peasants has any chance of stopping this the us ruling class is vigorously marketing divisive sectarian medieval politics what s the impact of this on labor in the us and what s to be done by the labor movement the working class in the united states is divided along many dimensions skill location education wage rates religion gender ethnicity country of origin and race among others among these gender ethnicity and race are most important the capitalist political economy here has been patriarchal and racist from its beginning the latter is the result of a vicious slavery that built the economy not just through the production of cotton but from the slave generated money that helped to fuel and in fact led the country s industrial revolution the unpaid labor of women in the home has been a gift to capital and women could be drawn into market based production when needed and discarded when not employers soon discovered that race and gender could be used to split workers fomenting competition rather than solidarity among them this has been done by the allocation of job with racial and ethnic minorities and women given the worst jobs and white men the best this along with constant racist and sexist propaganda soon gave rise to the notion that these groups deserved their fate i have written much about this and refer readers to can the working class change the world here however consider some of the results of racism a brief look at some data from the united states shows the remarkable disparities between black and white members of the working class median black family income is barely 60 percent that of whites a little more than ten percentage points higher than it was in 1949 black median household net worth is just 5 percent that of whites blacks earn less than whites at all levels of education astonishingly a 10 000 increase in the average annual wage of an occupation is associated with a seven percentage point decrease in the proportion of black men in that occupation besides earnings when we consider poverty unemployment health education housing life expectancy infant mortality or the criminal justice system we must conclude that having a black skin in and of itself is a grave economic and social disadvantage while having a white skin confers considerable advantage there have been forces within the u s labor movement that have actively combated the divisions in the working class sometimes with success usually these forces have been radical the communist party in the 1930s is a good example the left led labor unions purged from the cio during the anti communist hysteria of the late 1940s often did the same however much more needs to be done statements of principles of no toleration for racism and sexism by the afl cio and all individual unions are essential as is action to back these up collective bargaining agreements with strong no discrimination clauses and a willingness to strike picket and boycott over employer violations are necessary support for feminist and anti racist groups in the larger society is a must as is active participation in the protests and actions of black lives matter and similar groups promotion of caucuses of women black workers and ethnic groups as well as lgbtq workers could give these groups of oppressed workers a strong voice in every labor organization militant actions on the political front are badly needed general strikes to support immigrants oppose the rise of fascist groups and the like would show a real commitment to equality is there any impact of the present condition of and trends within the labor movement in the us on the labor movements in other countries historically u s organized labor has been all too often an adjunct of u s foreign policy opposing left wing unions and movements around the world therefore it has been rare for the u s labor movement to have a positive much less a radical impact on workers movements in other countries anti imperialism and opposition to u s led wars on poor countries has never been very strong in the u s labor movement this is still the case things may change as workers especially younger ones are drawn to social democracy however even in social democratic organizations a u s first view is common and a neglect of what is going on in the rest of the world is as well another positive development is the greater radicalism and willingness to organize and join unions of newly arrived immigrants into the united states hopefully these immigrants will along with black and other oppressed workers succeed in building a labor movement with an international working class perspective what are your suggestions proposals to labor as a whole and to the labor defying official leadership to deal with the reality that you have pictured in the answers above here is a long quote from my book can the working class change the world that i think answers this question labor unions have been a principal response by workers to capital s exploitation they are necessary defense agents and as long as capitalism exists they will form if unions mirror corporations in their structures which all too many do there isn t much hope that they will confront capital and this is all the more the case if they have entered into a compact with employers that views the two sides as cooperators interested primarily in the profitability of the owners businesses this strategy has failed the proof being in the deteriorating working conditions and life circumstances of union members and the sharp drop in union densities during the period in which partnership has marked much of the labor movement worldwide to begin to reverse course then labor unions must become democratic run by the membership and they must abandon labor management cooperation schemes since it is unlikely that current leaders will seek to do either of these things the only way forward is to get rid of the leadership in the united states a perusal of the magazine labor notes shows that there have been frequent attempts by rank and file activists to take control of their unions and put them on a democratic and militant path a few have been successful most have not no doubt the fear of such insurgencies has made some unions willing to mobilize members and take on the companies with strikes picketing and boycotts but reform has proved a daunting task similar to efforts by political advocates to move the democratic party to the left those in power seldom want to relinquish control and they will be as ruthless as necessary to beat back rivals still labor rebellions have been successful at all levels of unions corrupt criminal leadership was defeated in both the teamsters and the united mine workers for example and though the rank and file victors were subsequently defeated or weakened neither union is as awful as it once was in addition sometimes revolt has taken the form of a new union one that breaks away from the parent organization or if a group of workers have no representation and no existing union is willing to help them organize they might establish an independent union again in the united states an example of the former is the national union of healthcare workers nuhw tired of the service employees international union s seiu top down management its embrace of labor management cooperation and sweetheart deals with employers its frequent impositions of trusteeships the national union takes over the running of a local union on recalcitrant locals with rebellious and independent leaders and outright corruption the nuhw broke away from seiu in 2009 before asking what a democratic union looks like and what it should do it is proper to say that there are now unions that work in a democratic manner in the united states the best example is the united electrical workers an independent labor union that has the distinction of being kicked out of both the afl and the cio its national office and locals rest on the will of the members it does not make deals with employers and it has never been tainted with corruption officer salaries and expenses are strictly controlled and its constitution is a model of democratic principles that the union has adhered to through good times and bad other u s unions have served their members well too the overall trajectory however has been toward bureaucratic undemocratic structures and an increasingly unwarranted faith in labor capital compromise democracy means more than voting the structure of the union must be democratic there should be direct ballot casting by all the members for any office as opposed to convention delegates usually chosen by the leadership voting for those same leaders as is common in many u s unions term limits for officers are essential no advantage of any kind should be proffered to incumbents seeking reelection strict limits should be placed on the salaries of union officers and a careful open audit of expenses should be routine the rank and file should participate in all union activities from planning for negotiations setting demands strike preparation and the striking and picketing union meetings should be open to all members especially those with home responsibilities almost always women and also held at convenient times meeting discussions should be open and criticisms should be welcomed and debated special attention should be paid in all aspects of the union to the concerns and needs of racial and ethnic minorities as well as lgbt members retirees should be encouraged to take part in all union actions if a rank and file uprising is successful a breakaway union is founded or an independent union is created and even if these result in more democracy it is still necessary to ask democracy for what what are the principles and goals of the organization the nuhw lists these as its core beliefs a strong union is led by its members worker power is the foundation of a just society quality patient care requires that caregivers have a voice in their workplaces and are protected from retaliation healthcare is a human right this is a good preliminary set of principles but more needs to be said and done first education must be a priority compulsory classes should greet new members teaching them about the union s history and that of the labor movement as a whole and regular short courses summer schools and longer learning experiences should be made available with at least some courses required to maintain membership in these classes the construction of a broader array of principles and aspirations can be developed several come to mind an examination of racism and patriarchy the objectives here are ending discrimination in the union building greater solidarity compelling the employer to behave in a nondiscriminatory manner and leading the union to play a positive role in combating these divisions in the community and society a study of imperialism and militarism for unions in the global north the purpose of this would be to build an understanding of the role of their governments and employers in subjugating the peoples of the global south and of the past complicity of unions in this a radical labor movement cannot become a reality unless it is adamantly opposed to imperial wars arms production and sales the infiltration of the military into local economies and daily life the patriotism of flags and national anthems the mantra that we must all support the troops in the global north nationalism is a disease that impedes the global working class solidarity essential for human liberation unfortunately it is so deeply embedded in the institutional structure of capitalist society that the task of eliminating it is formidable yet if the effort isn t made there is no hope of the working class changing the world a serious discussion of the multiple environmental crises we face if these aren t working class issues what are global warming is a workplace issue ecology professor and writer andreas malm writes physical labour makes the body warm if it takes place under the sun or inside facilities without advanced air conditioning systems excessively high temperatures will make the sweat flow more profusely and the bodily powers sag until the worker suffers heat exhaustion or worse this will not be an ordeal for the average software developer or financial adviser but for people who pick vegetables build skyscrapers pave roads drive buses sew clothes in poorly ventilated factories or mend cars in slum workshops it already is and the bulk of exceptionally hot working days are now anthropogenic in nature with every little rise in average temperatures on earth thermal conditions in millions of workplaces around the world shift further primarily in the tropical and subtropical regions where the majority of the working population some four billion people live their days for every degree a greater chunk of output will be lost estimated to reach more than a third of total production after four degrees in this heat workers simply cannot keep up the same pace given the magnitude of impending disasters labor must make the environment a major concern this means opposing all corporate and public actions that exacerbate global warming the poisoning of air soil and water and the extinction of species among others when construction unions lobby for ruinous shale oil pipelines as happened in the united states other unions must speak out and condemn such self serving deeds as democratic unions strengthen and their principles and goals become more class conscious they will naturally ally themselves with like minded unions and community groups in this way a labor movement worthy of the name can begin and grow one concerned with the entirety of the working class including those in the reserve army of labor and the informal sector a union s most important immediate concern is with its members welfare here the question of democracy for what can take concrete form labor management cooperation should be immediately and permanently rejected replaced by an adversarial relationship that makes no concessions to management instead the union makes demands that challenge capital s control of the workplace higher wages are always on the table but so must be shorter hours more paid time off full parental leave for both parents for at least a few months a safe and nontoxic work environment active union participation in decisions related to both technology and work intensity an unrestricted right to strike over any issue a shortened grievance resolution procedure with rank and file participation at all levels the right not to cross picket lines while on employer related business and high monetary penalties for plant closures and relocations whatever makes laboring less alienated and weakens capital s control should be vigorously and relentlessly pursued unions should never allow the employer to play one plant off against another much less cooperate in this as the united auto workers has done strong protections for women and racial and ethnic minorities should be part of every contract when a union faces a multi plant employer or more than one employer it should organize coordinated communications and tactics among the officers on the shop floor office or store solidarity must be more than a word and an injury to any worker should anger every sister and brother what do you suggest to read study to learners like me interested to know about labor two of my books might be useful

the company arranged for the sale of approximately 27 000 geo in cerro moro precipitate inventory which will be reflected in gross revenue and operating cash flow in the second quarter of approximately 34 5 million the company expects a further sale of precipitate in june 2019 with a value in excess of 10 million following which the precipitate inventory at cerro moro is expected to return to normal levels the company s strong financial position is expected to improve further over the year with the continuation of robust operating results the sale of unrefined gold and silver carried over from both 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 and the expected receipt of 800 million in cash from the recently announced sale of chapada as anticipated cyclical first quarter payments are reflected in the negative movement in working capital from december 31 2018 which include the payment of year end related accruals and timing of regular trades payables precipitate inventory build up

march 7 2019 the company signed an integration agreement with glencore international ag and newmont goldcorp collectively the parties pursuant to which the agua rica project would be developed and operated using the existing infrastructure and facilities of minera alumbrera limited in the catamarca province of argentina the agreement represents a significant step forward towards the optimization and development of agua rica the alumbrera infrastructure including the existing infrastructure for concentrate logistics located in northern argentina between the mine site and the port presents a unique opportunity to enhance project economics while also reducing both the project complexity and environmental footprint the parties have established a technical committee to direct the review and evaluation of the integrated project it is expected that a pre feasibility study for the integrated project will be completed in mid 2019 and that a full feasibility study with updated mineral reserve production and project cost estimates will be completed by mid 2020 this will provide the framework for the submission of a new environmental impact assessment eia to the authorities of the catamarca province and for the continued engagement with local stakeholders and communities the company is evaluating beginning the eia process in 2019 given the level of significant detail in the pre feasibility study chapada brazil subsequent to the quarter end the company announced a definitive agreement to sell the wholly owned chapada mine to lundin mining corporation for total consideration of over 1 0 billion the sale transaction which reflects chapada s full value including the anticipated plant expansion the sale transaction will enhance the company s position as a dominant intermediate precious metals company with a high quality asset portfolio a robust balance sheet and cash flow profile and peer leading jurisdictional focus the company will have a greater concentration of precious metals while still maintaining significant copper exposure through agua rica upon closing of the sale a significant and immediate improvement to overall financial flexibility is expected to allow for the pursuit of near term value maximizing opportunities that are currently in the company s portfolio and also to increase shareholder returns initially by way of a 100 increase in the annual dividend in summary beyond this enhanced industry position the financial benefits of the sale on closing are expected to be as follows improved financial flexibility the sale is expected to provide a significant improvement to the company s financial flexibility going forward as follows the lower debt levels will result in interest savings in excess of 35 million per annum over the tenure of the debt chapada s five year plan to maintain geo guidance levels included total sustaining and expansionary expenditures of 458 million and 240 million respectively which will now not be incurred by the company while chapada maintains a long life based on mineral inventory it is expected that sustaining and expansionary expenditures would significantly reduce free cash flows during the period that coincides with reduced production particularly for gold resulting in less operating cash flow than in previous periods the company s net free cash flow 2 that would have been required for chapada s sustaining and expansionary capital expenditures can now be applied for the maximization of value enhancing opportunities at the company s other operations including further production at jacobina and canadian malartic and improvements to costs at cerro moro which derive significantly better returns as well as expected costs lower than the previous phase 2 and phase 3 expansion plans for chapada consistent with the company s strategy these opportunities are to be funded organically by cash flows from operations with the expected capital requirements to be covered by net free cash flow 2 immediate leverage reduction the up front cash consideration of 800 million provides for significant deleveraging benefits highlighted by a decline in current net debt leverage ratio to 1 5x from the year end 2018 value of 2 5x with an opportunity for further reductions based on the contingent payments the company is prioritizing the repayment of the outstanding revolving credit facility and then the repayment of near and medium term fixed term debt maturities increased shareholder returns dividend increased the improved balance sheet and interest savings will enable the company as approved by the board of directors and conditional on closing of the sale transaction to double its annual dividend to 0 04 per share this improves returns to shareholders while allowing the company flexibility for further future capital returns the sale transaction is subject to customary regulatory and third party approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019 expansion opportunities at jacobina brazil at jacobina the company has developed a two phase plan to increase production beyond 150 000 geo per year as follows the first phase considers production increases to between 165 000 to 170 000 ounces per year through a mill optimization to 6 500 tonnes per calendar day tpd from the current operating rate of 5 800 tpd this compares to prior year production of roughly 145 000 ounces representing approximately 20 000 25 000 additional ounces of production this phase requires very modest capital and is expected to be implemented by mid 2020 the second phase considers a larger increase in the plant capacity to between 8 000 and 8 500 tpd which would significantly increase production estimated to exceed 225 000 ounces per year with current preliminary estimates of total capital expenditures of 100 million over the expected implementation period up to 2022 expansion opportunities at canadian malartic canada at canadian malartic studies show the potential for production increases of approximately 75 000 geo per year based on yamana s 50 interest with project costs and economics currently under evaluation opportunities at odyssey east malartic sladen and sheehan zones have the potential to provide new sources of ore for the canadian malartic mill the extraction is expected to be by way of underground mining methods with ore fed to the existing malartic mill displacing a portion of the lower grade open pit ores the permit allowing for the development of an underground ramp at the odyssey project was received in december 2018 these opportunities including those for other mines are expected at total costs lower than the previous expansion plans for chapada consistent with the company s strategy these opportunities are to be funded organically by cash flows from operations with the expected capital requirements to be covered by net free cash flow 2 rand malartic acquisition increased canadian malartic land package on march 26 2019 the canadian malartic general partnership acquired the rand malartic property adjacent to the east side of the canadian malartic property the rand malartic property covers 262 hectares and extends 1 7 kilometres eastward along the cadillac larder lake break within the piché group immediately east of the odyssey project the rand malartic property has the same favourable geological features as the odyssey project with several porphyry intrusions in the southernmost portion of piché group volcanic rocks the 39 and 67 zones are porphyry hosted with similar mineralogy and alteration to odyssey the former appears to be geologically continuous with the odyssey south zone in addition the geological environment is similar to the historical malartic gold fields mine located 3 kilometres to the east on the adjoining midway property a budget of 1 9 million on a 100 interest basis has been allocated for the 2019 exploration program at rand malartic including an initial 10 000 metres of drilling to test the eastern extension of the odyssey project and its possible continuity onto the rand malartic property the near surface potential will also be investigated exploration drilling in the first quarter has focused on defining several internal zones in the odyssey deposit and expanding odyssey towards the property boundary with rand malartic construction development and exploration canadian malartic 50 interest canada the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 ownership interest basis expansionary capital expenditures are expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work continues to focus on the highway 117 road deviation which is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 overburden stripping and rock excavation suyai argentina the company previously completed several studies that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favourable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is a development ready project with significant financial and social benefits to the local community along with the broader provincial and national communities as and when the provincial moratorium on mining lapses and the company has completed favourable engagement with the local community the company would expedite its development plans for the project monument bay canada the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised of three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 billion years gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2019 the focus of exploration is to define drill targets through a thorough re evaluation of the geology and mineralized zones drilling of 5 000 metres is planned as a follow up to the ongoing re log and geological studies other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans on the highly prospective claims surrounding the mine re logging of historical holes and exploratory drilling supported the potential to extend the oxide mineralization as well as potential for copper gold deposits within the joint venture claims agua de la falda has processing capacity and infrastructure already installed exploration continuation of the exploration programs started early in 2019 with the objective of advancing important exploration discoveries at the company s existing operations in the near term the company plans to increase its exploration spending during the year further building mineral reserves and mineral resources at key operations as well as building a pipeline of exploration opportunities to ensure future growth exploration plans will focus on extending mine life at cerro moro el peñón and minera florida while increasing grade mineral resources and mine life at jacobina and canadian malartic to allow increases in production at low costs in particular at jacobina over the course of the year exploration spend will be allocated to support the planned expansion and the program targets new mineral reserves at a grade of 3 0 g t or better health safety environment and corporate responsibility the company s total recordable injury frequency rate was 0 6 for the first quarter of 2019 all yamana operations completed the first month of 2019 with zero lost time injuries this is an improvement from previous years as the first quarter has historically seen higher average rates of health and safety injuries compared with the remainder of the year in conjunction with the local communities and authorities jacobina led an emergency response exercise in february the simulation helps test the preparedness of the mine the community and supporting authorities for serious

the securities laws in effect in canada which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements of united states securities laws contained in industry guide 7 the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with canadian national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum the cim cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves adopted by the cim council as amended these definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the securities and exchange commission the commission contained in industry guide 7 under industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report mineral reserves the three year historical average price is used in any mineral reserve or cash flow analysis to designate mineral reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority in addition the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni 43 101 however these terms are not defined terms under industry guide 7 investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations in contrast issuers reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 report mineralization that does not constitute mineral reserves by commission standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures accordingly information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by u s companies reporting pursuant to industry guide 7 non gaap financial measures and additional line items and subtotals in financial statements the company has included certain non gaap performance measures to supplement its condensed consolidated interim financial statements which are presented in accordance with ifrs including the following cash costs per geo sold and by product basis cash costs per pound of copper sold all in sustaining costs per geo sold and by product basis all in sustaining costs per pound of copper sold net debt net free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold silver sold and average realized price per pound of copper sold adjusted earnings the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable for definitions and descriptions of the non gaap measures other than those noted and reconciled below and additional subtotals in financial statements refer to section 10 non gaap financial measures and additional line items or subtotals in financial statements of the company s md a for the three months ended march 31 2019 geo production and sales production and sales of silver are treated as a gold equivalent in determining a combined precious metal production or sales unit commonly referred to as gold equivalent ounces geo specifically guidance geo produced are calculated by converting silver production to its gold equivalent using relative gold silver metal prices at an assumed ratio and adding the converted silver production expressed in gold ounces to the ounces of gold production actual geo production and sales calculations are based on an average realized gold to silver price ratio for the relevant period cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities the measure of cash costs and all in sustaining costs aisc along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms cash costs per geo sold cash costs per pound of copper sold aisc per geo sold and aisc per pound of copper sold do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs operating profit or cash flows presented under ifrs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about its underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis as follows cash costs per geo sold the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cost of sales excluding dda net of treatment and refining charges the attributable cost is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to geo sold thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal sales these costs are then divided by geo sold cash costs of copper shown on a per pound basis in the case of chapada costs directly attributable to geo and copper will be allocated on that attributable basis non attributable costs will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues for each metal which will be determined annually at the beginning of each year costs attributable to copper sales are divided by commercial copper pounds sold aisc figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the world gold council wgc a non regulatory market development organization for the gold industry adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies aisc per sold seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing and selling geo from current operations the total costs used as the numerator of the unitary calculation represent cash costs defined above and includes cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures including stripping and underground mine development corporate and mine site general and administrative expense sustaining mine site exploration and evaluation expensed and capitalized and accretion and amortization of reclamation and remediation aisc do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments borrowing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of aisc does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods aisc per geo sold reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the geo production and sales activities but net of by product revenue credits from sales of copper and zinc aisc per pound of copper reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to geo or copper production activities net debt the company uses the financial measure net debt which is a non gaap financial measure to supplement information in its consolidated financial statements the company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs the company and certain investors and analysts use this information to evaluate the company s performance the non gaap financial measure of net debt does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore it may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs net debt is calculated as the sum of the current and non current portions of long term debt

the new silk road is the term for an ambitious trade corridor first proposed by the chinese regime under its current president xi jinping in 2013 the grand design also known confusingly as the belt and road initiative bri is a belt of overland corridors and a road of shipping lanes it consists of a vast network of railways pipelines highways and ports that would extend west through the mountainous former soviet republics and south to pakistan india and southeast asia so far over 60 countries containing two thirds of the world s population have either signed onto bri or say they intend to do so according to the center for foreign relations the chinese government has already spent about 200 billion on the growing list of mega projects projects including the 68 billion china pakistan economic corridor morgan stanley predicts china s expenditures on bri could climb as high as 1 3 trillion by 2027 the belt and road initiative is seen by proponents as an economic driver of proportions never seen before in human history it would not only allow asia to relieve its infrastructure bottleneck ie an 800 billion annual shortfall on infrastructure spending but bring less developed neighboring nations into the modern world by providing a growing market of 1 38 billion chinese consumers opponents argue that is naive and the real intent of bri is to carve new chinese spheres of influence in asia that will replace the united states in debt poor nations to china for decades and restore china to its former imperial glory this article leans heavily towards the latter interpretation of bri particularly its linkages between china s industrial and military build up it explains why belt and road is really a dangerous trojan horse hiding behind china s territorial ambitions that should be resisted especially by vulnerable countries that are risking long term debt servitude the new silk road the silk routes connected china india tibet the persian empire the mediterranean countries and parts of north and east africa the 7 000 mile silk road begins at the chinese city of x an formerly chang an when it reaches dunhuang the silk road splits into three routes the southern route central route and and northern route these trade routes spread throughout the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and extended as far as pakistan india and even rome the silk road routes were established during the han dynasty which opened trade to the west in 130 bc and they lasted until 1453 ad when the ottoman empire boycotted trade with china and closed them the han extended the great wall of china to protect the movement of chinese goods along the silk road the maritime silk road was a network of shipping lines from the red sea to east africa india china and southeast asia the network consisted of ship routes in two general directions the east china sea routes and the south china sea routes the east china sea routes connected the chinese mainland to the northeast asian regions of the liaodong peninsula the korean peninsula and the japanese islands the south china sea route heads down then up through the malacca straits into the bay of bengal opening up china to the coasts of the indian ocean the red sea the persian gulf and the african continent these shipping lanes are still in use as mentioned the belt part of the belt and road initiative introduced by president xi jinping in 2013 refers to a network of overland road and rail routes and oil natural gas pipelines planned to run along the major eurasian land bridges china mongolia russia china central and west asia china indochina peninsula china pakistan bangladesh china india myanmar they ll stretch from xi an in central china through central asia reaching as far as moscow rotterdam and venice the road is a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure projects from south and southeast asia to east africa and the northern mediterranean sea china is already the world s largest consumer of commodities why does it need to build a belt and road there are a few reasons the first as mentioned is to construct physical infrastructure such as railways roads and bridges that will help the region to meet its 800 billion annual infrastructure shortfall estimated by the asian development bank china would also build 50 special economic zones modeled after the shenzhen special economic zone first launched in 1980 under economic reformer president deng xiaoping less benevolently bri would allow china to expand the use of the chinese currency the yuan something we have written about as the global influence of the us dollar as the world s reserve currency wanes according to the centre for foreign relations bri is also a central tenet of xi jinping s pushback against obama s pivot to asia contain china by extending us ties to southeast asia and distancing himself from his predecessors who followed deng s philosophy bide your strength bide your time for xi the waiting is over the time for imperialist expansion is now political aspirations an asia geopolitical expert says that while the new silk road satisfies a number of economic goals for china including expanding its supply chains accessing overseas labor and preventing massive layoffs when companies run out of domestic infrastructure to build the over riding goal is regional influence richard javad heydarian author of asia s new battlefield the usa china and the struggle for the western pacific writes above all however it allows china to lock in precious mineral resources and transform nations across the eurasian land mass and indian ocean into long term debtors a leading credit rating agency recently warned that the obor is driven primarily by china s efforts to extend its global influence where genuine infrastructure needs and commercial logic might be secondary to political motivations the result is what one observer aptly described as debt trap diplomacy since some nations end up piling up unsustainable debts to china meanwhile larger nations such as india have raised concerns over china s geopolitical intensions since the project runs through the disputed kashmir region other countries from indonesia to the philippines and nigeria have raised concerns over the quality of chinese infrastructure investments their compliance with good governance and environmental regulations and beijing s tendency to employ not only chinese technology and engineers but also chinese labourers for overseas projects debt trap so far we have learned the 5ws of the belt and road initiative it s easy to see how the trillion dollar infrastructure network benefits china but what about the 60 odd nations who have said they want in what s in it for them the huge projects need to be paid for somehow china s idea is for chinese state owned firms to build the infrastructure paid for by participating countries those who can t afford it and that is most of them would be offered inexpensive loans and credit it s no different from banks offering rock bottom interest rates to homeowners whose incomes are below that needed to support a mortgage chinese state owned banks and china led international financial institutions like the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib would shoulder the debt burden china has set up an initial 40 billion silk road fund while the aiib is allocating an additional 50 billion but the loans come with huge risks in 2017 when sri lanka couldn t pay off its chinese creditors beijing took control of colombo a strategic port through a 99 year lease by the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of sri lanka s foreign debt was owed to china the money accepted for around 8 billion worth of ports and highways planned through bri some countries have scaled back or canceled bri projects due to the specter of unsustainable debt burdens states al jazeera hopefully italy is aware of the risks the southern european country is heavily in debt and went into recession last year it reportedly wants to re balance sino italian trade by exporting more to china it is the 13th eu member country that has signed an mou with china regarding bri but the first g7 nation to do so sparking condemnation from the united states which is engaged in a trade war with china and the eu which earlier this year branded china a systemic rival and wants to restrict chinese investment in europe al jazeera said military buildup is it a coincidence that the chinese president xi jingping is racing around trying to sign countries onto bri while at the same time posing for photos in full military uniform saluting chinese soldiers we don t think so tuesday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s liberation army pla and the chinese navy did not squander the opportunity to show its latest show of power a stealth destroyer according to a reuters story the combat ready 10 000 ton nanchang 101 is armed with 113 vertical launch sales able to fire hhq 0 surface to air missiles yj 18 anti cruise missiles and cj 10 land attack cruise missiles we have written extensively on the escalating tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei ongoing maneuvers demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china is increasing its military drills around japan with japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times within a year against chinese aircraft according to japan s annual military white paper there are also frequent tensions in the taiwan strait the body of water separating china and taiwan a us ally the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced reunification between china and taiwan would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us meanwhile china continues to expand its military a year ago it was reported that china planned to boost military spending by 8 1 in 2018 compared to a 7 increase in 2017 a reuters in depth report on how china is displacing america as the world s predominant military power in asia is required reading for anyone interested in how the geopolitical balance of power in the north pacific is shifting it details how xi jinping is overhauling the pla which includes the navy by pouring more resources into the navy and ridding the pla s ranks of corruption in just over two decades china has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the u s armory china s shipyards have spawned the world s biggest navy which now rules the waves in east asia beijing can now launch nuclear armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines giving it a powerful second strike capability and the pla is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the south china sea while stepping up preparations to recover taiwan by force if necessary for the first time since portuguese traders reached the chinese coast five centuries ago china has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast conflict between china and the united states in these waters would be destructive and bloody particularly a clash over taiwan according to serving and retired senior american officers and despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the cold war there would be no guarantee america would prevail the u s could lose said gary roughead co chair of a bipartisan review of the trump administration s defense strategy published in november we really are at a significant inflection point in history industry military connection we know that china is planning a huge infrastructure buildout in its trillion dollar bri involving some 60 odd countries and we know that beijing is at the same time bulking up its military what we don t know is if the two are related is china covertly funneling money from bri into its military in december 2018 the new york times reported on a secret proposal to expand a program by the pakistani air force by building chinese military jets weaponry and other hardware there would also be increased cooperation between china and pakistan in space where rocket propelled technology often overlaps with the military according to the article the military projects were designated as part of china s belt and road initiative in response to that claim cnbc quoted michael fuchs a senior fellow at the center for american progress and a former u s deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs from 2013 to 2016 that doesn t necessarily mean the chinese military will use the entire bri to its advantage but it will certainly tap into a number of projects he added bri infrastructure schemes in member countries such as pakistan sri lanka and djibouti are all about giving access to china s military he said a 2018 report by c4ads a us based research group sought to tease out whether china s portrayal of bri as strictly economic is true as explained by south china morning post the report looked at 15 chinese funded port projects in bangladesh sri lanka cambodia australia oman malaysia indonesia djibouti and elsewhere in the indo pacific region it found that the projects were not win win for china and the host countries as china claimed rather the investments appear to generate political influence stealthily expand china s military presence and create an advantageous strategic environment in the region the report stated resource raids of course none of this should come as a shock if we look at how china has repeatedly sought raw materials necessary to feed its resource ravenous economy we ve covered how china is locking up critical resources in the us s own backyard we also know that bri whatever china s motivations is going to require a hell of a lot more mined commodities it doesn t have an abundance of like copper zinc iron ore etc mining com reported in under 10 years the number of china headquartered mining companies with assets in africa went from just a handful in 2006 to 120 in 2015 two high profile examples are the acquisition by china general nuclear power corporation of the husab uranium project in namibia and zijin mining s involvement 39 6 in the massive kamoa kakula copper deposit in the drc while iron ore and copper have been the hot targets of overseas acquisitions by chinese firms the chinese have also gone after gold nickel tin and coking coal more recently the most desired metals are those that feed into the tectonic global shift from fossil fuels to the electrification of vehicles china molybdenum bought the tenke copper and cobalt mine in the democratic republic of congo for 2 65 billion in an effort to secure a supply of cobalt for ev batteries last summer china s ganfeng lithium paid chilean state lithium miner 87 5 million for sqm s 50 stake in the cauchari olaroz lithium project in argentina the purchase means china now effectively controls half of the world s lithium production necessary for lithium ion batteries conclusion china s ascent from an economic backwater to a 21st century superpower is nothing short of incredible within 30 years the country whose citizenry was oppressed impoverished and riding around on bicycles is now the world s biggest consumer of mined commodities influences real estate markets worldwide just look at vancouver and has obscenely rich people driving 100 000 luxury cars except for its horrible air quality china is now the envy of many poorer countries but that doesn t mean they should roll over and let china take advantage of its weaker brethren the belt and road initiative is not some modern day asian version of the marshall plan the united states had obvious economic motivations in giving 12 billion to help rebuild western europe but there was also the strategic imperative of helping europe to get back on its feet in order to contain a rising ussr no such threat exists with bri china has no reason to come to its neighbors aid with multi billion dollar infrastructure loans other than to gain economic and political influence over them sure there may be some programs where it s a win win but it appears the deck is way stacked against bri host nations where the outcome will almost certainly leave china the clear winner as uncle ben in spider man said with great power comes great responsibility that assumes that the one wielding the power doesn t have an ulterior motive with china though we can be pretty much certain it does by richard mills

earnings per share net debt and free cash flow are measures not recognized under u s gaap and which exclude certain non cash and special items that may obscure trends and operating performance not indicative of the company s core financial activities management considers ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and free cash flow to be key indicators of the company s operating performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the company s performance in addition similar measures are utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants and ratios contained in the company s financing arrangements and management uses these measures for developing internal budgets and forecasting purposes ebitda is defined as net income adjusted to reflect income tax expense interest expense net of interest income depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the company s core operating performance adjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted to reflect certain items that management does not consider to be reflective of the company s core operating performance adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares respectively outstanding during the period net debt is defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and is useful to both management and investors in evaluating the company s ability to service and repay its debt when analyzing the company s operating performance investors should use ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and free cash flow as supplements to and not as alternatives for net income operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with u s gaap and not as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the company s results of operations as reported under u s gaap other companies may report ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and free cash flow differently and therefore the company s results may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in addition in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income it should be noted that in the future the company may incur expenses similar to or in excess of the adjustments in the below presentation this presentation of adjusted ebitda

with just a little more than two years of president trump being in office it should be clear to everyone that the left will engage in its scorched earth battle tactics to destroy almost anyone that he will nominate for anything that obviously includes me so i do not take it personally however it does matter who is on the board of the federal reserve and who influences the internal debate about how it exercises its enormous government power i have been right a lot more than i have been wrong on monetary policy the most recent vindication has been my harsh criticism of the federal reserve decision to raise interest rates last fall when there was no inflation anywhere to be seen and commodity prices had been suffering a severe deflation even the federal reserve itself acknowledged at the start of this year after a near 4 000 point decline in the dow jones industrial average from september through december that it had indeed made a terrible mistake since reversing course in january the economy and the stock market have been on a tear and there is still no inflation i rest my case paul krugman of the new york times attacked me for speaking positively about the gold standard in the past the sheer truth is that the monetary stability provided by the bretton woods gold standard helped to make the period of 1948 to 1971 into the american golden age of economic growth and middle class prosperity the left likes to point this out all the time my view is that ending the bretton woods gold standard in 1971 was a huge mistake and a major factor in the catastrophic tidal wave of inflation that squashed real take home pay for middle class workers in that decade mosads however i do not advocate a return to the gold standard today i now support basing monetary policy upon general commodity prices for oil wheat cotton copper and so on i also look at asset prices and other measures of price changes such as the consumer price index the federal reserve should foster maximum prosperity by holding prices constant and keeping the dollar strong combined with tax cuts and deregulatory initiatives that could give us growth of 3 percent and above along with rising wages without inflation for years to come i have also been asked why i along with many others falsely predicted high inflation in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the frantic rounds of quantitative easing by the federal reserve which added trillions of dollars to its balance sheet what i did not appreciate at the time was the deflationary impact of the interest on reserves policy which sucked money out of the economy at the same time the federal reserve was trying to pour it in by buying bonds and mortgage backed securities i believe that the commencement of the interest on reserves policy in october 2008 was a total blunder it eliminated the ability of the federal reserve to inject dollar liquidity into the economy the federal reserve seemed to think that paying big banks nearly 40 billion a year to sit on money with the interest on reserves policy was a good idea i disagree the larger lesson from the failed period following the recession was that almost all of the government interventions from tax increases to massive bailouts to the 830 billion stimulus plan to obamacare and dodd frank regulations were wrongheaded and contributed to a very weak recovery they delivered half of the 4 percent annual growth that the keynesian analysts expected even the forecasts of president obama showed that the economy would have grown faster without these policies no amount of money creation would have reversed the curse of these bad policies another criticism by professor krugman and others is for my claim that federal reserve economists have the wrong model in mind when i get to the federal reserve i will challenge the phillips curve austerity model that too much growth causes inflation a corollary is the false belief that the economy can only grow at 2 percent because of secular stagnation this is just an excuse for the lousy performance before trump from 2001 to 2016 the economy grew at barely 2 percent trump has since brought us up to 3 percent when president reagan instituted supply side tax cuts with the sound monetary policy of paul volcker the economy surged by well over 3 percent each year from 1983 to 2000 with controlled inflation that is the beautiful picture i want to help recreate at the federal reserve think rising wages lower taxes less regulatory drag and rapid growth in take home pay all with no inflation true growth reduces inflation rather than ignites it the academic economists may not like this challenge to their limits to growth orthodoxy but i think most american workers and businesses will say it is about time that someone bring this prosperity maximizing philosophy to those hallowed halls of the federal reserve stephen moore a longtime contributor to the hill and a nominee to the federal reserve board of governors is a visiting fellow at the heritage foundation and a consultant with freedomworks he was an economic adviser to the donald trump campaign his book with arthur laffer is trumponomics inside the america

internal budgets and forecasting purposes ebitda is defined as net income adjusted to reflect income tax expense interest expense net of interest income depreciation and amortization and adjusted

adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares respectively outstanding during the period net debt is defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and is useful to both management and investors in evaluating the company s ability to service and repay its debt when analyzing the company s operating performance investors should use ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and free cash flow as supplements to and not as alternatives for net income operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with u s gaap and not as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted net income adjusted earnings per share net debt and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in

alberta oil sands operations achieved 98 upgrader utilization and synthetic crude oil sco production of 341 200 bbls d despite the impact of mandatory production curtailments on bitumen production hebron production in the first quarter increased to 18 300 bbls d net to the company and is continuing to ramp up following the completion of the fifth production well during the quarter first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 the company distributed 662 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 514 million of common shares in the first quarter of 2019 financial results operating earnings suncor s first quarter 2019 operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share compared to 985 million 0 60 per common share in the prior year quarter and included the impact of the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailments as well as after tax insurance proceeds of 264 million related to the company s assets in libya operating earnings were also favourably influenced by an inventory valuation gain associated with improving crude prices increased overall upstream production and sales volumes narrower heavy crude oil differentials and strong sales from the company s refining assets these factors were offset by lower wti benchmark crude pricing and higher overall operating and transportation costs predominantly attributed to the production ramp up at fort hills an increase in share based compensation costs and an additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired partway through the first quarter of 2018 operating earnings were also unfavourably impacted by higher royalties associated with the improvement in both bitumen pricing and production the overall impact of crude oil and refined product inventory valuation had a net positive impact on operating earnings of 288 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 86 million net positive impact in the prior year quarter the increase was due to a favourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment associated with the consumption of less expensive crude feedstock in r m partially offset by a deferral of profit on intersegment sales from oil sands to r m remaining in inventory recorded in the corporate and eliminations segment net earnings net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the first quarter of 2019 included a 261 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt net earnings in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 329 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a 133 million non cash after tax gain in the exploration and production e p segment associated with the exchange of the company s mineral landholdings in northeast british columbia with canbriam energy inc canbriam the company s investment in canbriam was subsequently written down to nil in the fourth quarter of 2018 following an assessment of forward natural gas prices and the impact on estimated future cash flows funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the first quarter of 2018 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share for the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory in addition to the items noted with respect to funds from operations cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by the use of less cash in the company s working capital balances in the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter this was due to a decrease in taxes paid and a smaller increase in the company s inventory value with the prior year quarter including a substantial build of product inventory in preparation for the full turnaround at the edmonton refinery in the second quarter of 2018 operating results suncor s total upstream production was 764 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 689 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the ramp up of fort hills production improved asset reliability at syncrude and the hebron ramp up this was partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta which took effect at the beginning of the year our upgraders achieved strong reliability throughout the first quarter and our refining business generated record funds from operations illustrating the resiliency of suncor s cash flow and operational flexibility when broader industry challenges exist said mark little oil sands operations production was 396 600 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 404 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was due to mandatory production curtailments which primarily affected the company s non upgraded bitumen sales as the company maximized the production of higher value sco barrels upgrader utilization improved to 98 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80 in the prior year quarter with the prior year quarter being impacted by a weather related outage higher upgrader utilization resulted in a decrease to total oil sands operations production due to the approximate 20 yield loss associated with the bitumen upgrading process oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 29 95 in the first quarter of 2019 an increase from 26 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of mandatory production curtailments and the change in production mix associated with a higher proportion of sco production and lower bitumen volumes in addition to an increase in operating selling and general os g costs oil sands operations os g costs in the first quarter of 2019 included an increase in overburden stripping expenses during the optimal time of the year to complete this work the company expects the increase in this activity in the current period to partially offset oil sands operations cash operating costs in subsequent periods bringing oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel in line with guidance for 2019 total oil sands operations cash operating costs were 1 074 billion compared to 982 million in the prior year quarter and were also impacted by higher natural gas pricing suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 78 400 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase in production attributed to the ramp up of operations throughout the past year partially offset by mandatory production curtailments fort hills cash operating costs per barrel were 29 60 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 53 65 in the prior year quarter with the improvement primarily attributed to the increase in production despite the mandatory production curtailments suncor s share of syncrude production was 182 200 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 142 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to stronger asset reliability with the prior year quarter impacted by a constrained bitumen feed line and the advancement of upgrader maintenance partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments upgrader utilization at syncrude improved to 90 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 71 in the prior year quarter to help achieve this suncor allocated a portion of its mandated production limit by the alberta government to syncrude which reduced lower value bitumen sales at oil sands operations syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 37 05 in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 50 75 in the prior year quarter due to the combination of higher production and lower os g costs resulting from a decrease in maintenance expenses partially offset by the increase in natural gas prices production volumes at e p were 107 100 boe d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 117 700 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to the continuing staged return of white rose to full operations as well as natural declines in the united kingdom partially offset by the increase in production from hebron during the first quarter of 2019 the company received 363 million in insurance proceeds for its libyan assets 264 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment that may be dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to ramp up to an estimated peak of 10 500 bbls d net to suncor in 2020 suncor is a 30 partner in the project refinery crude throughput was 444 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 96 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 453 500 bbls d and a utilization rate of 98 in the prior year quarter with solid reliability achieved in both quarters refined products sales increased in the first quarter of 2019 to 542 800 bbls d compared to 512 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase attributed to record canadian wholesale sales volumes and higher retail sales volumes strategy update suncor s 2019 capital program is focused on the enhancement and optimization of the company s operating asset performance safety and reliability including projects focused on delivering increased earnings and funds from operations through further cost savings and structural margin improvements in addition the company is developing step out opportunities and asset extensions within the offshore business in e p excluding capitalized interest the company invested 875 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 1 214 billion in the prior year quarter this was due primarily to the decrease in capital associated with the staged completion and commissioning of the fort hills extraction plants in the first half of 2018 as well as a decrease in asset sustainment and maintenance capital associated with lower overall planned maintenance preparation expenditures following the execution of a more significant maintenance program in the spring of 2018 at both oil sands and r m although capital spending was lower in the first quarter of 2019 the company s capital guidance range of 4 9 billion to 5 6 billion remains unchanged drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up ahead of schedule other e p activity in the first quarter included development drilling at hibernia white rose and buzzard

akin morakinyo in a recent paper by brookings on the danger of accumulation of debt by african countries he expressed concerns for african countries racking up debts sadly nigeria came to mind while putting finishing touches to this article this morning the news broke that the nigerian debt has risen by n2 66trillion in one year this translates to about 8 7 it is a common prayer in nigeria that may we not leave debt for our children you will gauge from the chorus amen that that is seen as an important prayer but is debt bequest a bad thing can we avoid it if not what sort of debt and how much of it can be left for the children finally is nigeria moving towards a debt overhang answering all these questions leads us to starting from understanding the concept of debt overhang debt overhang a phenomenon that applies to individuals households business entities and government alike refers to a situation whereby even though new debt will improve the profile of an entity it is unable to access it because the present level of debt is such that the benefits of additional debt is deemed to be subject to partial appropriation by the existing debt holders a structural macroeconomic debt overhang is a condition where additional credit creation measures are engaged in to address an underemployment or output gap the build up of which leads to a debt overhang it so happens that in most scenarios the debt overhang is preserved by substituting one form of public debt for another and it keeps growing debt overhang has various negative consequences in the literature its major consequence of serving as a disincentive for investment attracts my attention as a perspective the importance of investment as a factor of economic growth is emphasized by the employment channel through the employment channel investment enhances not only productivity but also the general welfare of the citizenry thereby leading to economic development but debt overhang hinders investments for instance an economic entity is forced to pass up investments that yield positive net present value npv a positive npv is a selection criterion for some projects and when profit oriented entities have to pass up investment alternatives just because it does not have additional capacity to take up debts to execute such alternatives opportunities to add value is lost for a nation this ultimately leads to a gdp growth that is less than its potential the concern in this instance is nigeria not only is nigeria the most populous black nation in the world but also one of the world s fastest growing countries in terms of population indeed it is projected that we will have a population of about 400million by 2050 this growth is not peculiar to nigeria the whole of africa which has roughly 1 billion in population today is expected to have grown to 4 billion by that time with nigeria contributing its own quota of 10 recently nigeria added 2 86b to its debt stock november 2018 thereby moving our total debt stock to about 76b this is inclusive of states 11b portion of the debt the tenor of this new debt are 7years 12 years and 30years with the life expectancy at birth in nigeria ranked at 178th in the world by the world health organization in 2018 currently at about 55 years for male and 56 years for female most of the current actors in consummating this loan will not be alive by the time the last tranche is paid in 2048 that is if there are no restructuring the truth is more are on the way when you project our debt profile for instance from a foreign denominated loan portfolio of below 1b up till 1993 when we joined the loan billionaire club we have gradually trended upwards to around 76billion the current foreign domestic borrowing ratio profile is 86 14 the dmo has the mandate to tilt the ratio to 60 40 the idea behind this is to free up domestic funds available from competition between the private sector and the government apparently the availability of government debt instruments which is almost always well over subscribe tends to stifle the potential growth of the private sector with its pivotal growth implication on the economy when funds they can use are equally competed for by the government the flipside to this mission is that rejigging the combination imposes more attention to dollar receivables over a long period as shortfalls may portend danger the concern for accumulation of debt is valid if you review the trend it is going up perpetually even when oil prices go up secondly the debt to income ratio which measures the tendency for revenue to cover debt is also going up and it is projected that in about 5 years revenue will no longer be able to service debt this if it crystalizes is a dire situation as the international rating agencies will write our ratings down thirdly there are some doubts about the total capture of our debt stock what that means is that the debt gdp ratio of about 18 which we currently refer to as a healthy level when compared to the estimated headroom of about 56 for countries of our development status may be incorrect if this is so and some local government debts and other uncollateralized debts have been excluded then our current debt gdp ratio may be incorrect and we may actually be nearer debt trap than we think lastly there is a concern over our foreign exchange receivables over that length of time considering that over 80 of our current foreign exchange receipts come from oil and developments in the oil markets particularly as it relates to transition to renewable energy the implication on price in the future is anything but heart warming in order to address our concerns we need to note that the source of debt is budget deficit for budget deficit to be bridged there is the need for borrowing according to the dmo in the 2018 budget there is a funding gap of over n2 1trillion of which n1 6t is to be met with domestic and foreign debts of n750b and n850b respectively sovereign debt is an equivalent of financial leverage for a company just as this leads to growth for some institutions which think through it can be an albatross for others who spend loans on frivolous things therefore debt is not necessarily bad if it leads to development conversely a low level of debt debt gdp ratio such as 21 3 for nigeria in 2017 is not necessarily good if the debt make up is not justifiable after all since 1990 our highest point was at 75 in 1991 and lowest was 7 3 in 2008 for some countries debt appears linked to economic growth and development cases in point are the us which has 19t in debt and is the largest economy in the world and japan the third biggest economy in the world have debt gdp ratio in excess of 250 but the ownership of the public debt gives another dimension to the issue as seemingly alarming the debt gdp ratio of japan is less than 5 of that portfolio is owned by foreigners while only one third of the american debt is owned by foreign countries curiously our current budget deficit looks like the subsidy for fuel whether we should and what level of subsidy the country can provide on fuel and the management of oil subsidy is a discussion for another day to make debt worth while we need to do a number of things firstly it needs to be channeled towards investment as debt that are obtained to fund life style or towards crass expenses or spending can be akin to smoking a stick of cigarette which gives satisfaction while smoking it but cannot be relied upon to give such satisfaction in medium time soon after you feel like smoking another stick and the remnant you can see is the stub snugly tied to this point is that debts should also be project targeted for instance the sum of 350m was specifically borrowed to enhance the port harcourt refinery in 1988 this involved the enhancement of production from 60 000 barrel per stream day bpsd to 210 000 bpsd this approach allows for ascertaining in specific terms the purpose of debts the process should not only be transparent debts should be taken to build capacity the return on investment should be undertaken only when the return is justifiable should such loans be taken in order words debts should be tied to project that are not only self liquidating but also such that will have multiplier effects on the economy for instance a 1995 study of the effect of software producer microsoft on the local economy revealed that each job at microsoft created 6 7 new jobs in washington state whereas a job at boeing created 3 8 jobs targeting such multiplier effects are critical a rigorous cost benefit analysis and link to economic growth should be a pre requisite for obtaining loans for instance it seems that over time for us in nigeria there is a correlation between debt pile up and poverty poverty seems to be perpetually increasing with these debts in comparison countries like china who had over 750 million poor people years ago now have just about 10 million in that category this is in contrast with nigeria with the number of poor people seemingly increasing on a yearly basis and now on the world poverty clock 86 9million people live in extreme poverty putting nigeria as the number one nation usurping india with a population that is more than 6 times nigeria s this will continue to be so for as long as our gdp growth rate currently below 2 falls short of population growth rate which is currently just below 3 per year which should put nigeria as the third most populous country in the world by 2050 these two growth rates directly affect the per capita income of a country allowance should be given for maintenance of projects currently in nigeria such allowances are either not given not adequately given or consumed altogether with corruption the maintenance culture is important for us to continue to reap the full benefits of our investment all our refineries now operate below installed capacity because of this problem and we now find ourselves in the trap of importing what we have the capacity to produce a comprehensive plan is critical good projection about national budget deficit and projects will give option on timing of debts for instance the cost of debt for sa obtained earlier in the year is cheaper than ours an important integral part of this is the institutionalization of a capital budget plan and framework which a new government should put in place within its first 6 months which will run for 3 years with serious accountability responsibility up to the highest level of the national assembly in this new age of knowledge economy know where and know when are increasingly becoming more important than know how and know what mere facts the different timings for nigeria s foreign debt as well as that of south africa this same year comes to mind whereas south africa obtained loan at 6 in may nigeria obtained loan at 9 75 in october in the space of few months there has been about 33 increase in the cost of debt by implication nigeria has started a catch up race with south africa from day one in terms of putting the project to use and should then have the potential of earning more in order to compete with the equivalent south african project this scenario is needless if our administration has a better know when appreciation tied to this penultimate issue is the growth rate of the economy comparing our cost of debt with economic growth rate gives a gloomy scenario if we compare our economy that is expected to grow at 2 by year end with 9 75 cost of debt literarily means that whereas the nigerian economy to which the funds is applied will grow at 2 we will add 9 75 in value to the lender of the funds whether country or institution the engagement of the federal legislators by the populace is critical the truth is that the total number of legislators in both houses of 469 in conjunction with the executive consummate this debts on our behalf once the budget is approved it implies that the 200 million nigerians have approved it we need to see representation as a very serious business the consciousness on the part of the electorates is currently missing by some of the actions of the federal legislatures on budgeting you find it difficult to argue that the consciousness on issues of debt is not also lost on the majority of them we deserve the best people to take decisions at the highest level of consciousness and responsibility waste and cost of governance are also too high in nigeria when we engage in needless debate about infrastructure as a major driver of growth which creates an enabling environment for businesses to thrive we need to acknowledge that the level of waste and cost of governance is too high this can be attested to by the mind boggling level of appointments at all levels of executive and a wanton waste of resources eradicating waste and drastically reducing cost of governance will unarguably create a healthy headroom to allocate resources to enhance the level of infrastructure expanding our revenue base is of importance in alliance with the position of the imf our tax base may currently be adequate but not efficient as there are loopholes still to be blocked this concern for an inadequate revenue base is founded in the fact that a budget deficit is inseparably attached to deficit budgeting arising from insufficient revenue to meet budgeted expenditure for instance as of may 2017 only 14mio people of 70million taxable nigerians pay taxes this means 80 of economically active and taxable nigerians still evade taxes of the big five economies in africa nigeria with the biggest economy has by far the least tax revenue to gdp of 6 1 this compares with 26 9 for south africa and 10 33 11 6 and 18 4 for angola ethiopia and kenya respectively even though this may be a reflection of poverty spread the 80 of economically active nigerians which are currently evading taxes shows that there is a huge room for improvement this leakage adds to the leakage from the grossly under taxed nigerians again to compound the situation corruption cannot be taxed the issue of tax structure is indeed a discussion for another day when these tax leakages which have multiplier effect are combined with the unjustifiable economic rent driven government concessions there comes the inevitable realization that some of our sovereign debts are probably needless as a proper revenue capture would have made these debts unnecessary in conclusion whereas an accumulated public debt in itself and a high debt gdp ratio is not necessarily bad the structure of ownership between domestic and foreign should be watched most importantly how transparent the process is in addition to the economic justification of the debt debt planning the timing of the debt paying attention to the revenue base of the country as well as dogged implementation of projects are of utmost importance the rising debt service as a percentage of revenue which the dmo warned against in its recent debt sustainability analysis dsa and which imf warned as being extremely high at 63 before the last foreign debt can only be reined in if in addition to the mentioned palliatives our currency does not suffer depreciation this looks like a tall order considering the current macroeconomic situation and outlook morakinyo lectures

release references to oil sands operations exclude suncor s interests in fort hills and syncrude calgary alberta may 01 2019 globe newswire suncor s integrated model has consistently generated positive results through changing market conditions including mandatory production curtailments in alberta and the first quarter of 2019 was no different said mark little president and chief operating officer funds from operations increased to 2 6 billion in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to execute on our long term strategy funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the prior year quarter cash flow provided by operating activities which includes changes in non cash working capital was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share and net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to operating earnings of 985 million 0 60 per common share and net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter refining and marketing r m delivered record quarterly funds from operations and operating earnings of 1 253 billion and 1 009 billion respectively total oil sands production was 657 200 barrels per day bbls d compared to 571 700 bbls d in the prior year quarter increased production from the ramp up at fort hills and improved syncrude asset utilization of 90 more than offset the impact of mandatory production curtailments implemented by the government of alberta oil sands operations achieved 98 upgrader utilization and synthetic crude oil sco production of 341 200 bbls d despite the impact of mandatory production curtailments on bitumen production hebron production in the first quarter increased to 18 300 bbls d net to the company and is continuing to ramp up following the completion of the fifth production well during the quarter first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 the company distributed 662 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 514 million of common shares in the first quarter of 2019 financial results operating earnings suncor s first quarter 2019 operating earnings were 1 209 billion 0 77 per common share compared to 985 million 0 60 per common share in the prior year quarter and included the impact of the government of alberta s mandatory production curtailments as well as after tax insurance proceeds of 264 million related to the company s assets in libya operating earnings were also favourably influenced by an inventory valuation gain associated with improving crude prices increased overall upstream production and sales volumes narrower heavy crude oil differentials and strong sales from the company s refining assets these factors were offset by lower wti benchmark crude pricing and higher overall operating and transportation costs predominantly attributed to the production ramp up at fort hills an increase in share based compensation costs and an additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired partway through the first quarter of 2018 operating earnings were also unfavourably impacted by higher royalties associated with the improvement in both bitumen pricing and production the overall impact of crude oil and refined product inventory valuation had a net positive impact on operating earnings of 288 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 86 million net positive impact in the prior year quarter the increase was due to a favourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment associated with the consumption of less expensive crude feedstock in r m partially offset by a deferral of profit on intersegment sales from oil sands to r m remaining in inventory recorded in the corporate and eliminations segment net earnings net earnings were 1 470 billion 0 93 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net earnings of 789 million 0 48 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the first quarter of 2019 included a 261 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange gain on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt net earnings in the prior year quarter included an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 329 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt and a 133 million non cash after tax gain in the exploration and production e p segment associated with the exchange of the company s mineral landholdings in northeast british columbia with canbriam energy inc canbriam the company s investment in canbriam was subsequently written down to nil in the fourth quarter of 2018 following an assessment of forward natural gas prices and the impact on estimated future cash flows funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 585 billion 1 64 per common share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 2 164 billion 1 32 per common share in the first quarter of 2018 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above cash flow provided by operating activities was 1 548 billion 0 98 per common share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 724 million 0 44 per common share for the first quarter of 2018 reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable and inventory in addition to the items noted with respect to funds from operations cash flow provided by operating activities was further impacted by the use of less cash in the company s working capital balances in the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter this was due to a decrease in taxes paid and a smaller increase in the company s inventory value with the prior year quarter including a substantial build of product inventory in preparation for the full turnaround at the edmonton refinery in the second quarter of 2018 operating results suncor s total upstream production was 764 300 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 689 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the ramp up of fort hills production improved asset reliability at syncrude and the hebron ramp up this was partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments in the province of alberta which took effect at the beginning of the year our upgraders achieved strong reliability throughout the first quarter and our refining business generated record funds from operations illustrating the resiliency of suncor s cash flow and operational flexibility when broader industry challenges exist said mark little oil sands operations production was 396 600 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 404 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was due to mandatory production curtailments which primarily affected the company s non upgraded bitumen sales as the company maximized the production of higher value sco barrels upgrader utilization improved to 98 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 80 in the prior year quarter with the prior year quarter being impacted by a weather related outage higher upgrader utilization resulted in a decrease to total oil sands operations production due to the approximate 20 yield loss associated with the bitumen upgrading process oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 29 95 in the first quarter of 2019 an increase from 26 85 in the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of mandatory production curtailments and the change in production mix associated with a higher proportion of sco production and lower bitumen volumes in addition to an increase in operating selling and general os g costs oil sands operations os g costs in the first quarter of 2019 included an increase in overburden stripping expenses during the optimal time of the year to complete this work the company expects the increase in this activity in the current period to partially offset oil sands operations cash operating costs in subsequent periods bringing oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel in line with guidance for 2019 total oil sands operations cash operating costs were 1 074 billion compared to 982 million in the prior year quarter and were also impacted by higher natural gas pricing suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 78 400 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 24 600 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase in production attributed to the ramp up of operations throughout the past year partially offset by mandatory production curtailments fort hills cash operating costs per barrel were 29 60 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 53 65 in the prior year quarter with the improvement primarily attributed to the increase in production despite the mandatory production curtailments suncor s share of syncrude production was 182 200 bbls d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 142 300 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to stronger asset reliability with the prior year quarter impacted by a constrained bitumen feed line and the advancement of upgrader maintenance partially offset by the impact of mandatory production curtailments upgrader utilization at syncrude improved to 90 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 71 in the prior year quarter to help achieve this suncor allocated a portion of its mandated production limit by the alberta government to syncrude which reduced lower value bitumen sales at oil sands operations syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 37 05 in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 50 75 in the prior year quarter due to the combination of higher production and lower os g costs resulting from a decrease in maintenance expenses partially offset by the increase in natural gas prices production volumes at e p were 107 100 boe d in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 117 700 boe d in the prior year quarter the decrease in production was primarily due to the continuing staged return of white rose to full operations as well as natural declines in the united kingdom partially offset by the increase in production from hebron during the first quarter of 2019 the company received 363 million in insurance proceeds for its libyan assets 264 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment that may be dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets first oil was achieved ahead of schedule at the oda project offshore norway in the first quarter of 2019 and is expected to ramp up to an estimated peak of 10 500 bbls d net to suncor in 2020 suncor is a 30 partner in the project refinery crude throughput was 444 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 96 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 453 500 bbls d and a utilization rate of 98 in the prior year quarter with solid reliability achieved in both quarters refined products sales increased in the first quarter of 2019 to 542 800 bbls d compared to 512 900 bbls d in the prior year quarter with the increase attributed to record canadian wholesale sales volumes and higher retail sales volumes strategy update suncor s 2019 capital program is focused on the enhancement and optimization of the company s operating asset performance safety and reliability including projects focused on delivering increased earnings and funds from operations through further cost savings and structural margin improvements in addition the company is developing step out opportunities and asset extensions within the offshore business in e p excluding capitalized interest the company invested 875 million on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 a decrease from 1 214 billion in the prior year quarter this was due primarily to the decrease in capital associated with the staged completion and commissioning of the fort hills extraction plants in the first half of 2018 as well as a decrease in asset sustainment and maintenance capital associated with lower overall planned maintenance preparation expenditures following the execution of a more significant maintenance program in the spring of 2018 at both oil sands and r m although capital spending was lower in the first quarter of 2019 the company s capital guidance range of 4 9 billion to 5 6 billion remains unchanged drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up ahead of schedule other e p activity in the first quarter included development drilling at hibernia white rose and buzzard and development work on the west white rose project and the norwegian oda and fenja projects during the first quarter of 2019 suncor s board of directors approved a 17 dividend increase and up to an

the u s federal debt has more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis shooting up from 9 4 trillion in mid 2008 to over 21 trillion in mid 2018 and in excess of 22 trillion in april 2019 this debt is never paid off the government just keeps paying the interest on it and interest rates are rising the fed has announced plans to raise rates by 2020 to normal levels a fed funds target of 3 5 percent and to sell about 1 5 trillion in federal securities at the rate of 50 billion monthly this will further grow the mountain of federal debt on the market and unlike the fed which rebates the interest to the government after deducting its costs the new buyers of these securities will be pocketing the interest adding to the taxpayers bill if the fed follows through with its plans projections are that by 2027 u s taxpayers will owe 1 trillion annually just in interest on the federal debt that is enough to fund president donald trump s trillion dollar infrastructure plan every year and it is a direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy investors holding most of the bonds where will this money come from crippling taxes wholesale privatization of public assets and elimination of social services will not be sufficient to cover the bill bondholder debt is unnecessary the irony is that the united states does not need to carry a debt to bondholders at all it has been financially sovereign ever since president franklin d roosevelt took the dollar off the gold standard domestically in 1933 this was recognized by beardsley ruml chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york in a 1945 presentation before the american bar association titled taxes for revenue are obsolete the necessity for government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments he said but it is not true for a national government the government was now at liberty to spend as needed to meet its budget drawing on credit issued by its own central bank it could do this until price inflation indicated a weakened purchasing power of the currency then and only then would the government need to levy taxes not to fund the budget but to counteract inflation by contracting the money supply the principal purpose of taxes said ruml was the maintenance of a dollar which has stable purchasing power over the years sometimes this purpose is stated as the avoidance of inflation the government could be funded without taxes by drawing on credit from its own central bank and since there was no longer a need for gold to cover the loan the central bank would not have to borrow it could just create the money on its books this insight is a basic tenet of modern monetary theory the government does not need to borrow or tax at least until prices shoot up it can just create the money it needs by writing an overdraft on its account at the fed the bankers power revolution it could do that in theory but some laws would need to be changed currently the federal government is required to have the money in its account before spending it after the dollar went off the gold standard in 1933 congress could have had the fed just print money and lend it to the government cutting the banks out but wall street lobbied for an amendment to the federal reserve act forbidding the fed to buy bonds directly from the treasury as it had done in the past the treasury can borrow from itself by transferring money from intragovernmental accounts social security and other trust funds that are under the auspices of the treasury and have a surplus but these funds do not include the federal reserve which can lend to the government only by buying federal securities from bond dealers the fed s website states the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities are categorized as held by the public because they are not in government accounts further evidence that the fed is considered independent of the government according to marriner eccles chairman of the federal reserve from 1934 to 1948 the prohibition against allowing the government to borrow from its own central bank was written into the banking act of 1935 at the behest of the securities dealers a historical review on the website of the new york federal reserve quotes eccles as stating i think the real reasons for writing the prohibition into the can be traced to certain government bond dealers who quite naturally had their eyes on business that might be lost to them if direct purchasing were permitted the government was required to sell bonds through wall street middlemen which the fed could buy only through open market operations conducted by the open market committee rep wright patman chairman of the house committee on banking and currency from 1963 to 1975 called the official sanctioning of the federal open market committee in the banking laws of 1933 and 1935 the power revolution the transfer of the money power to the banks the fomc established a mechanism by which money was created through bond sales in what was essentially a rigged market patman said the open market is in reality a tightly closed market only a selected few bond dealers were entitled to bid on the bonds the treasury made available for auction each week the practical effect he said was to take money from the taxpayer and give it to these dealers feeding off the real economy that massive wall street subsidy was the subject of testimony by eccles to the house committee on banking and currency on march 3 5 1947 patman asked eccles now since 1935 in order for the federal reserve banks to buy government bonds they had to go through a middleman is that correct eccles replied in the affirmative patman then launched into a prophetic warning stating i am opposed to the united states government which possesses the sovereign and exclusive privilege of creating money paying private bankers for the use of its own money i insist it is absolutely wrong for this committee to permit this condition to continue and saddle the taxpayers of this nation with a burden of debt that they will not be able to liquidate in a hundred years or two hundred years the truth of that statement is painfully evident today when we have a 21 trillion debt that cannot possibly be repaid the government just keeps rolling it over and paying the interest to banks and bondholders feeding the financialized economy in which money makes money without producing new goods and services the financialized economy has become a parasite feeding off the real economy driving producers and workers further and further into debt in the 1960s patman attempted to have the fed nationalized the effort failed but his committee did succeed in forcing the central bank to rebate its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the prohibition against direct lending by the central bank to the government however remains in force the money power is still with the fomc and the banks a model we can no longer afford today the debt growth model has reached its limits as even the bank for international settlements the central bankers bank in switzerland acknowledges in its june 2016 annual report the bis said that debt levels were too high productivity growth was too low and the room for policy maneuver was too narrow the global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the debt fueled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture the bis warned but the solutions it proposed would continue the austerity policies long imposed on countries that cannot pay their debts it prescribed prudential fiscal and above all structural policies structural readjustment that means privatizing public assets slashing services and raising taxes choking off the very productivity needed to pay the nations debts that approach has repeatedly been tried and has failed as witnessed most recently in the devastated economy of greece meanwhile according to minneapolis fed president neel kashkari financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government bailout only modestly from 84 percent to 67 percent that means there is still a 67 percent chance of another major systemwide crisis and this one could be worse than the last the biggest banks are bigger local banks are fewer and global debt levels are higher the economy has farther to fall the regulators models are obsolete aimed at a form of old fashioned banking that has long since been abandoned we need a new model one designed to serve the needs of the public and the economy rather than to maximize shareholder profits at their expense before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of publishing truthout has been a stalwart independent news publication for over two

entitled adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share adjusted operating income loss per share is derived from adjusted operating income loss the chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income loss the company defines adjusted operating income loss as income loss from continuing operations excluding the after tax effects of income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net investment gains losses goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses

defined as gains losses on the early extinguishment of non recourse funding obligations early termination fees for other financing restructuring and or resulting gains losses on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business the company excludes net investment gains losses and infrequent or unusual non operating items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the company s segments and corporate and other activities a component of the company s net investment gains losses is the result of impairments the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles in addition the size and timing of other investment gains losses can be subject to the company s discretion and are influenced by market

block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss because in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends infrequent or unusual non operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss if in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends while some of these items may be significant components of net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders in accordance with u s gaap the company believes that adjusted operating income loss and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income loss including adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income loss attributable to the ongoing operations of the business management also uses adjusted operating income loss as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts however the items excluded from adjusted operating income loss have occurred in the past and could and in some cases will recur in the future adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders or net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of adjusted operating income loss may differ from the definitions used by other companies in the first quarter of 2019 the company revised how it taxes the adjustments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders to adjusted operating income loss to align the tax rate used in the reconciliation to each segment s local jurisdictional tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2019 the company used a tax rate of 27 percent and 30 percent for its canada and australia mortgage insurance segments respectively to tax effect their adjustments its domestic segments remain at a 21 percent tax rate in 2018 the company assumed a flat 21 percent tax rate on adjustments for all of its segments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders and adjusted operating income loss these adjustments are also net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests and net investment gains losses are adjusted for dac and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves prior year amounts have not been re presented to reflect this revised presentation however the previous methodology would not have resulted in a materially different segment level adjusted operating income loss the company recorded a pre tax expense of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 related to restructuring costs as it continues to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses there were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from

accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting this press release includes the non gaap financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and its domestic businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent the company s tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pretax income loss of each segment which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between u s gaap and local tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of the company s revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force insurance in force for the company s mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date risk in force for the company s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance for risk in force in the mortgage insurance businesses in canada and australia the company has computed an effective risk in force amount which recognizes that the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor of 35 that represents the highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of the mortgage insurance businesses in canada and australia in australia the company has certain risk share arrangements where it provides pro rata coverage of certain loans rather than 100 coverage as a result for loans with these risk share arrangements the applicable pro rata coverage amount provided is used when applying the factor the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the understanding of the operating performance of the businesses these operating performance measures enable the company to compare its operating performance across periods without regard to revenues or profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources cautionary note regarding forward

investments enhance the service we provide to our customers with an eye on delivering cleaner energy in a safe reliable and affordable manner we remain on track to invest cad 3 7 billion in 2019 and approximately cad 17 billion over the next five years in arizona tucson electric power or tep filed a rate case on april 1st using a 2018 historical test year tep is seeking to recover its investments made since its last rate case supporting customers in the transition to a cleaner energy future including expansion of its wind solar and natural gas generation resources earlier this year we announced that we had entered into an agreement with columbia power corporation and columbia basin trust to sell our 51 interest in the waneta expansion for approximately cad 1 billion during the quarter we progressed through the sale process and we successfully closed the transaction on april 16 lastly in conjunction with the waneta expansion sale we successfully settled a tender offer to repurchase us 400 million of the corporation s outstanding notes due to 2026 at fortis we are committed to reducing our environmental footprint during the quarter three significant milestones were achieved to support this commitment in march tep finalized its plans for construction of the us 370 million oso grande wind project construction of the 247 megawatt wind farm is expected to commence later this year and be online by the end of next year once completed it will become tep s largest renewable energy resource and generate enough power to supply nearly 100 000 homes this project is expected to increase tep s renewable energy production to approximately 28 in 2021 well ahead of the existing state renewable goal of 15 by 2025 and bringing the utility close to a 30 goal planned to be achieved by 2030 although we expect to meet our target well ahead of 2030 we are not stopping there we will continue to pursue new initiatives to support the shift to a lower carbon economy for our customers and we expect to be able to grow beyond the 30 previously targeted for 2030 turning to british columbia fortisbc announced a significant increase it its energy conservation and efficiency program over the next four years the nearly cad 370 million program will be focused on customer initiatives to lower energy use emissions and reduced energy bills these expenditures will increase fortisbc s rate base over the four years these conservation and efficiency enhancements are expected to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 50 000 tons annually which equates to taking close to 11 000 gasoline powered cars off the road a significant milestone was achieved in the wataynikaneyap power project last month when the leave to construct was obtained from the ontario energy board remaining milestones include finalization of environmental approvals which are expected to be received later this year the project is targeted to be completed in 2023 and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the diesel generation currently used by the communities we are confident in our ability to deliver on our cad 17 3 billion capital plan for the period 2019 2023 99 of our planned capital investments are in our regulated businesses the plan consists of a diverse mix of highly executable low risk projects needed to maintain an upgrade our existing infrastructure this capital plan supports our 6 7 average annual rate based growth and translates to over cad 35 billion in rate base in 2023 we remain optimistic in our ability to grow our portfolio of utility businesses our 45 years of dividend increases makes us a leader in dividend growth our strong growth profile coupled with our highly regulated businesses gives us confidence that we will continue this record and grow the dividend at an average annual growth rate of 6 through 2023 i ll now turn the call over to jocelyn for an update on our first quarter results jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer thank you barry and good morning everyone for the first quarter reported eps of cad 0 72 was cad 0 05 lower than last year this was largely due to a one time cad 30 million positive us tax adjustment in 2018 related to our filing of a consolidated state income tax return excluding one time items adjusted eps of cad 0 74 for the quarter was up cad 0 04 compared to the previous year reflecting a 4 7 eps increase our utilities continued to execute on their capital plans with cad 740 million invested during the first quarter now turning to slide 10 i ll take a look at the eps growth on a segmented basis first strong performance at uns and central hudson resulted in a cad 0 03 eps increase during the quarter higher sales at uns energy as a result of colder temperatures and the new rate order at central hudson were the key drivers of this increase central hudson s results were also positive impacted by timing differences associated with the rate order and operating costs these increases were partially offset by planned outage costs at uns a higher us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate favorably impacted the quarter the average rate was cad 1 33 this quarter compared to cad 1 26 in the first quarter last year this increase resulted in a cad 0 02 eps increase itc contributed a cad 0 01 increase to eps during the quarter this was driven by rate based growth partially offset by the reduced roe independence incentive adder our canadian and caribbean utilities increased eps by cad 0 01 driven mainly by rate based growth and higher electricity sales at turks and caicos sales at turks and caicos last year were impacted by hurricane irma offsetting growth at our regulated utilities was a cad 0 02 eps decrease associated with our nonregulated energy infrastructure businesses realized margins were lower at aitken creek and lower rainfall decreased production in belize lastly there was a cad 0 01 eps decrease during the quarter due to a higher number of weighted average common shares as a result of our dividends reinvestment plan the funding plan outlined at investor day this past fall remains intact the majority of the funding required to execute the five year capital plan will come from cash flow our operating cash flows drip proceeds and debt financing at the regulated utilities the atm program remains available to provide additional financing flexibility as barry discussed our recent sale of the waneta hydro plant for approximately cad 1 billion completed the asset sale components of our current capital funding plan net proceeds were used to pay down corporate short term borrowings as well as repurchase a portion of the corporation s outstanding 3 055 note due in 2026 the repayment of holding company debt strengthens our balance sheet improve our credit metrics and further supports our investment grade credit ratings overall we are pleased with the waneta sale we estimate our gain to be approximately cad 415 million and this gain is expected to recognized in the second quarter turning to our 2019 regulatory outlook there was a fair amount of regulatory activity during the first quarter in march ferc issued two notices of inquiry which seek comment on its policies for determining the roe used in setting rates and how to improve its transmission incentive policies to appropriately encourage the development of needed infrastructure to the benefit of our customers itc views the process as an opportunity to demonstrate the value of the independent transmission model as well as advocate for the appropriate incentives to drive needed investments with respect to the roe inquiry ferc is providing an opportunity for all stakeholders beyond those currently involved in new england or miso transmission roe litigations to comment on the new roe methodology we don t expect this will materially impact the miso based roe complaint process and we anticipate that ferc will issue and order later this year fortisbc filed its multiyear rate plan in march as the current term expires at the end of this year the proposed plan seeks approval for a rate setting framework for 2020 through to 2024 cost of capital is not included in its filing and we anticipate a decision in 2020 as barry mentioned tucson electric power filed its rate case april 1st and turning to slide 13 we wanted to spend some time on this filing current rates at tep are based on a mid 2015 test year and do not include approximately us 700 million of rate based investments at the utility since rates were last set these investments were made to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers meet increasing demand and improve the sustainability of our generation portfolio including the integration of over 1 000 megawatts of renewable resources scheduled to be on tep s system by the end of 2020 additional requests include an roe increase of 60 basis points to 10 35 and an equity thickness increase to 53 this equates to a non fuel revenue increase of us 115 million or us 76 million net revenue increase after considering a reduction in fuel costs the reduction in fuel cost is driven by our migration to a cleaner and more balanced resource portfolio tep s proposal translates into an average residential customer bill increase of approximately us 7 61 per month over the past 10 years tep has seen its rate base grow from us 1 billion to us 2 7 billion while keeping average customer rate increases consistently below inflation each year we await a procedural schedule from the arizona corporations commission to determine the timing of proceedings this concludes my remarks i ll now turn the call back to barry barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you jocelyn fortis consists of well run utilities we are now 99 regulated and we are one of the most diversified utility businesses in north america looking ahead our growth profile is strong with over 7 rate based growth expected over the next three years and 6 rate based growth over the next five years this supports our 6 average annual dividend growth guidance to 2023 we continue to focus on growing our utility businesses to summarize through the first quarter the following accomplishments positions us well for the remainder of 2019 we closed the waneta expansion sale for approximately cad 1 billion improved our credit metric outlook by using the waneta proceeds to pay down corporate debt including the cad 400 million us repurchase of notes due in 2026 advanced the wataynikaneyap power project by obtaining the leave to construct from the oeb progressed our commitment to reduce our environmental footprint with the announcement of the oso grande wind project and the fortisbc energy conservation efficiency program filed rate cases at tep and fortisbc and delivered strong eps growth in the quarter i ll now turn the call back over to stephanie stephanie amaimo vice president investor relations thank you barry this concludes the presentation at this time we d like to open the call to address questions from the investment community questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct a question and answer period if you would like to now register a question please press followed by the no 1 on your telephone if your question has been answered and you d like to withdraw your registration please press the sign if you are using a speakerphone please lift your handset before entering your request one moment please for the first question your first question comes from the line of robert kwan from rbc capital markets please go ahead robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst good morning maybe just barry v perry president chief executive officer good morning robert jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer good morning robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst morning maybe just to start with some of the opportunities that are potentially in front of you in bc and just wondering if there s an update on woodfibre lng and i guess generally just thoughts given the gas supply issues we had this past winter barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you robert for your question we continue to work with woodfibre they obviously have asked us to build a pipeline to sell them to get them some gas for their facility they re providing us some funds to do permitting procurement design of the pipeline so we continue to work with them on that and frankly i m probably anxious for them to make a final investment decisions but that s not yet been done so we re hopeful that will come soon and robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst i guess barry v perry president chief executive officer in terms of the i guess resilience and reliability of the gas network i m roger dall antonia is here our ceo of fortisbc he was a fellow that handled that crisis as a result of the enbridge pipeline rupture late last year did a great job for us so he s here for our annual meeting tomorrow and i ll let roger comment on that roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc thanks barry morning robert as far as woodfibre and the enbridge situation woodfibre holds their capacity and they haven t raised any issues with that so we don t see that as a concern and we are working with enbridge just generally on how we re addressing resiliency going forward robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay i guess just with that i m also wondering if woodfibre went ahead are there any discussions with the province or the bcuc and really upside i guess with strengthening whether that s actually getting something done additionally at tilbury or something around southern crossing roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc we re looking at both opportunities it s too early to discuss those plans in front of the bcuc and the government in the next little while as we look at both options robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst got it i can just finish with financing with the waneta divesture squaring up the funding plan i m just wondering what you might be thinking about though past that whether that s funding and making room for new assets or future step up in capital projects as it seems like there s a lot of things in front of you right now or even just streamlining the asset base barry v perry president chief executive officer robert maybe i ll wade in and jocelyn can follow up here but we ve been pretty clear that the cad 17 billion program required us to raise certain proceeds from asset sales and we ve now said the waneta transaction completes that we ve also been clear if our capital does go up that we have our atm program which s cad 500 million currently approved that we would turn that on and that would be we would that is our plan basically clearly if capex went well beyond levels that one could think about we would have to consider other opportunities to raise capital to be clear we are committed to our investment grade credit ratings we would do nothing that would harm those ratings robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst got it so that stands that atm is really the first option here barry v perry president chief executive officer that s correct robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay that s great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ben pham from bmo please go ahead ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay thanks good morning just going back to the waneta sale and you think what divestiture is does your holdco debts outlook that you highlighted at investor day is that are you well ahead of that spot that you presented or is it more of a gradual reduction jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so ben this is jocelyn so at investor day we actually had waneta included in our projections for holdco debt so i think we showed at investor day that holdco was going from 38 down to around 33 32 so we re on track with that plan with the close of the waneta sale ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay so the graphs are still in terms of the timing of waneta it s still more of a gradual reduction that jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yes ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst you bring forward the hold ok all right just wanted to check on that and then the on the just going back to some of the questions on future growth prospects there s a on some of the transmissions stuff in ontario there is a press release mentioning ontario capacity markets could drive your transmission initiatives can you comment a bit on that on why that could increase the probability of erie happening barry v perry president chief executive officer linda apsey s here with us from itc i would just comment obviously ben that we saw that developments in ontario were positive toward making projects like erie connector make more economic sense and we felt it would make some sense for us to come out in support of the initiatives that were occurring there the project still obviously does require a contract a long term contract for it to go ahead and we are not there on that at this point in time but overall the backdrop to some of the changes that are occurring in ontario are positive for the project linda apsey president chief executive officer itc holdings yeah absolutely good morning ben this is linda apsey yeah as barry mentioned certainly with the energy market capacity in market in pjm as well as obviously directional capacity interest in ontario obviously from a bc type project obviously we re trying to bring more attention to the benefits that can be created if you will both in terms of ontario through that transmission line just in the differentials that occurs in terms of capacity pricing in both those different markets so from our perspective capacity market was not something that ontario has i would say a lot of experience in and so bringing more attention to the benefits of a capacity market and the value of a project like the lake erie connector brings we re just really obviously trying to highlight that to continue to be part of the conversation and to continue to advance that project and highlighting the benefits and the need for the projects and continue to drive value for ontario customers ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay that s great and maybe to finish off some of the capex changes on the oso grande wind farm in arizona i m just more curious as the reiteration of the rate base at uns is that just because tax equity is going to pick up a greater share of that debt increase in capex that your rate base isn t changing barry v perry president chief executive officer i don t know if i understand your question ben i don t think that s part of it the are you referring to the cad 700 million rate based growth since the last historical test year in arizona ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst i was thinking more this was the higher megawatts on the oso grande wind farm it s going up by 200 million from previous disclosures and so it s cad 0 2 billion in capex and i m nitpicking a little bit on the numbers but is that you ve opted not to raise or change a rate base with that change so is it because the 200 million a big portion of those tax equity doesn t go to your rate base is that barry v perry president chief executive officer no that s not it ben ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst no okay barry v perry president chief executive officer we just obviously we weren t ready to update our overall program for the year a lot of projects in the cad 17 3 billion so i would say stay tuned for that but this is definitely an increased amount of capital but we haven t yet updated our overall program ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay got it okay thanks everybody operator your next question comes from the line of nicholas campanella from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey congrats on the quarter good morning barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey just looking at the regulatory items i was just curious if you could provide a timeframe if you haven t already on when you think we ll have a resolution for the itc complaints as well as the notice of inquiry barry v perry president chief executive officer linda you want to provide your perspective you re the closest to it so linda apsey president chief executive officer itc holdings good morning nick i mean yeah certainly our view is particularly on the roe the pending roe base complaint we still believe we will see a decision on that yet this year in terms of the notice of inquiries i think those are a little less certain in terms of what ferc will do once they ve received all of the various comments and reply comments i think that s less clear as to what their next steps might be or what their timeline might be but i think clearly we feel as though we will continue to see a decision yet this year on the miso based roe complaints i think we ll have to just wait and see based on the comments and the ferc and the composition of ferc what they might do on those nois nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks i guess just shifting to arizona we all saw the hudbay mine and it sounds like that s going to be your largest customer in the jurisdiction is there any way to quantify how meaningful that is to your top line sales and then if you could just remind us how that reconciles with your longer term forecasts and then perhaps we can talk about incremental opportunities in arizona as well barry v perry president chief executive officer well nick all i can say is that arizona s a pretty big business and we re bringing on a new customer that s going to be our largest customer that s got to be positive right so david s here david do you want to add some other color david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations yeah so our current largest customer is 80 megawatts so it s going to be north of that they re still trying to figure out what equipment they re going to have in their mine design we re working with them through that process over the balance of this year so don t really have a firm estimate of what that top line revenue impact would be but you could probably calculate pretty close yourself if you re looking at that above 80 megawatt type load and a typical capacity factor of a mine so you could probably get pretty close so yeah we re expecting them to start building early next year the transmission line that will serve them we expect that to start later this year and as hudbay has put out for this mine they re expecting that full production to be in by the end of 2022 so that is in our longer term forecast now it s moved around quite a bit over the last two years but that s the timeline that we currently have nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst appreciate it that s it for me thanks again barry v perry president chief executive officer thanks nick operator your next question comes from the line of robert catellier from cibc please go ahead robert catellier cibc world markets analyst hey good morning i was wondering if you could characterize what type of run rate you have to increase renewables at tep and uns given that you re bumping up against some of the renewable portfolio standards there barry v perry president chief executive officer david david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations so the obviously putting in the 250 megwatt oso grande project is going to be a big one for us that s the one that we currently have on our time horizon we expect that to be done by the end of next year that with a couple purchase power agreements that also come in next year will bring our portfolio to over 1 000 megawatts so we ve got we re doing all the plans for integrating not only that 1 000 megawatts but making room for a little more so we don t have a firm number for additional renewable resources that we will build over that near term but just to keep your eye out for our preliminary integrated resource plan that we re going to be filing here in the next couple weeks will show you what those resources look like now and then we re going to go through about a year long stakeholder process get input from our commission other stakeholders and develop a final integrated resource plan that will lay that out in a little bit more detail that won t be finished until about a year form now but it ll give you a pretty good heads up we plan on our current plan is owning any additional renewable energy that we put in the ground for our customers on a going forward basis because the vast majority other than this big wind project has been ppas so that s how you could look at it robert catellier cibc world markets analyst okay and then barry i wanted you to help me with the rate cases in bc you ve been an advocate for canadian regulators to improve the competitiveness of the cost of capital and the roes and the equity thicknesses basically i wondered if you could tell us how the rate applications in bc address that and help make the returns more competitive barry v perry president chief executive officer well this case that we ve field does not include cost of capital so costs of capital in bc it s a separate process rob so we ll obviously once we get to that we will be incorporating our thoughts in that filing i will just be clear to say that the canadian regulatory landscape is inferior to the us landscape our equity thickness is a full 10 points lower than our american businesses and that over the long term is a major competitive issue for canadian companies and it has to be fixed so we but we have to make a case of why it s good for our customers to fix that and we ll be doing that and that is a challenge that fortis is taking on and we re going to work transparently with respect with our regulators in canada to try to improve that situation robert catellier cibc world markets analyst if barry the question was actually in the context of the fact that this rate case doesn t address cost of capital i was wondering if there s any other items in there that help make it more balanced on a risk adjusted basis that might not meet the eye because they re not capital items barry v perry president chief executive officer roger s here to make a comment roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc morning robert just on the application itself traditionally in bc going back to the 90s cost of capital has been set separately that s rate of return as well as equity thickness from rate application so it s not unusual that our multiyear rate plan does not include a specific filing for cost of capital our last decision on cost of capital was 2016 so we do look time to time at financial situations to determine whether we ll be bringing forth a new cost of capital allocation we ve just filed this multiyear rate application as this application rolls forward we ll make another decision on when we think the right time is to bring forth a new cost of capital application as far as the application itself it s really an extension of the existing pvr they have a different focus the current pvr was really rooted in productivity efficiency on both o m and capital this program maintains this application maintains many of the same elements but it s more of a focus on targeted incentives around low carbon energy on demand side management and innovation so it s not directly changing in our view it s more of an extension of our current regulatory construct not a large departure so we don t see it having an impact right now on our view of cost of capital robert catellier cibc world markets analyst okay thank you very much barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you rob operator your next question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank please go ahead robert hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone want to circle back with rosemont just want to get a sense of when the relatively short transmission line to the mine would be completed as well as appreciate david s comments on load but just want to get a sense of how much load do you think you re going to get that project during the construction of it barry v perry president chief executive officer so rob you re peeling you want to peel the onion robert hope scotiabank analyst a little bit david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations i guess i was a little too vague purposely so because they still are developing their mining plan as far as the construction goes we should have that line built by the end of next year it s only a 13 mile route so the engineering is mostly done we have been doing prep work for that for years so it s all permitted and ready to go we just need to get it in time for them to start their operations but yeah i really can t say much more about the expected load there robert hope scotiabank analyst all right so let s do a broader question then so barry when you look at the overall market and the very strong valuations we re seeing on energy infrastructure items either majority or minority interests how do you weigh further strengthening the balance sheet versus your existing asset suite barry v perry president chief executive officer well first of all rob i take you back to the fact that we laid out a strong funding plan for the existing capital program and we re executing well on that plan and that does see our credit metrics improve over time so we ll start there but i would say frankly any offers we would receive on assets that would be similar to or better than what we got for waneta everything is for sale at those levels any ceo of a large public company would have to entertain those kinds of offers and i don t see those showing up but if they did appear for certain of our assets we would have to look at them david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations barry i could add a little color related to rosemont because one of the things that you re talking about the transmission line i think it s important to point out that we don t pay for that transmission line rosemont is paying the cad 30 million it ll take to construct that so when you look at from a customer perspective and that cash flow versus investment we have to make absolutely zero investment in order to serve rosemont so that s a really nice asset to have joining our company with a customer that size zero additional infrastructure need and obviously a big customer so that might provide a little bit of color for that later period cash topic robert hope scotiabank analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david quezada from raymond james please go ahead david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst thanks morning everyone my first question here just on wataynikaneyap just curious if there s any color you can provide on the permitting process and just if you could comment at all on whether or not that s going as expected barry v perry president chief executive officer it s going very well and gary smith who heads up that project for us is here gary you want to give an update gary j smith executive vice president eastern canadian and caribbean operations yeah we ve been at the permitting process for for sure pretty hard now for a couple of years and we ve met all the requirements in the permitting process the file now is in front of the minister to make a decision we just think there s a little bit more time required for them to digest the information we ve provided but we don t see any critical hurdles in our way to stop the project from moving forward so we do expect to get a decision soon but again exactly when that will be later this year is undetermined david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst okay that s good color thank you and maybe just one other one i realize this is a longer term opportunity but just on big chino if you had any early consultations with stakeholders there and how that process has been going barry v perry president chief executive officer well big chino is an interesting project obviously theoretically it s a great project for the region to have long durations of pump storage it would greatly enhance the ability of the region southwest region to bring more renewables onto the grid solar wind that being said it is a big project that would take seven eight years to complete and so we re evaluating our involvement in that project at this point in time and continuing to do certain initiatives there but i would say that it s a project we ll be making a decision on this year whether we continue to put development dollars into it going forward david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst okay fair enough thank you for that that s all for me operator your next question comes from the line of linda ezergailis with td securities please go ahead linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you i m wondering if you could help us understand whether your current funding plan addresses or should eliminate the negative outlook that s p has or how you feel about defending your s p rating versus potentially a downgrade barry v perry president chief executive officer well i would hope that they would remove it related to our strong execution in investing in our regulated businesses linda we re continuing to have good dialogue with s p i would not expect any immediate actions from them jocelyn you want to add jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i just i would say that the negative outlook stems from obviously post us tax reform and so any us tax reform was as expected for us and we do expect to get back to a metric similar to pre us tax reform in a few years so i suspect that that will create even better dialogue with s p barry v perry president chief executive officer yeah and linda to be clear i d like bbb unsecured debt rating with s p linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you that s helpful and maybe we can move on to aitken creek i realize that it s hard to predict that earnings stream but maybe you can help us see year to date what you re seeing both from a volume and margin perspective and beyond just help and deleveraging or funding would maybe moving that asset to rate based or for the right price exiting help your risk profile from a business risk perspective with rating agencies or some other strategic benefit barry v perry president chief executive officer i would say in a perfect world linda roger is sitting right next to me here so i would like to see that asset in regulated operations it is a critical asset for the management of the gas network in western canada and our utility fortisbc uses a lot of the capacity of the plant that s something we ll be thinking about in the future in terms of performance in the quarter and longer term performance i think since we bought it the asset has done very well it s actually i would say outperformed our expectations there s some potential to also expand the asset a little bit so roger maybe you can add some color on where we are in the quarter and some of the reasons why that we had a light quarter roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc yeah thanks barry morning linda i think the main driver is q1 2018 there s a couple of things happening that were not prevalent in 2019 so we had a colder regional winter q4 17 q1 18 relative to what we experienced in 2019 we had a very mild winter in the region pacific northwest and we experienced winter more into february and into march than the previous year so we had a greater demand for gas power storage q1 2018 we also had some maintenance constraints so gas prices were generally higher so there was a significant amount of gas pulled out of the ground in 2018 we are closing off deals and realizing the value of the market at the time 2019 partly because of weather and the enbridge situation there was lower prices so we were injecting more than withdrawing in the quarter that s really the driver we feel that q1 2019 was a good quarter but not as strong as 18 because of those factors linda ezergailis td securities analyst and can you comment on the scale of a potential expansion and the timing what factors need to be in place to expand that asset roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc we are just connecting to the north artery which is a small expansion of the system we are looking at development of the north aitken field that would be a few years away we don t have specific capital estimates yet it s really going to be determinant on market factors in the next two to three years so more to come on that one barry v perry president chief executive officer but fairly small in terms of capital roger roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc yeah less maybe cad 100 million linda ezergailis td securities analyst and what factors would need to be in place to move it to rate based roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc just lng development natural gas expansion in the pacific northwest ongoing increased demand for natural gas which we think is positive but those things will develop over time linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you and maybe just a final high level strategic question i guess for barry given some of the recent changes in provincial governments how has that affected your strategic lens and outlook on those geographies and does that increase the urgency to address some of your cost of capital issues you have with canada or might there be some opportunities to potentially to nonregulated assets in those geographies can you comment on i guess alberta and to a lesser extent ontario and anywhere else specifically that you think there s been a change in policy that might help or affect your business barry v perry president chief executive officer that s a big question linda i ll try to address it we re not overly interested in nonregulated assets other than i would say things like lng tolling or the contracted transmission that the erie connector would be involved in so things that look and feel like regulated items i would say in terms of the region we have a very positive relationship with the government in british columbia our natural gas business is doing well there a fair amount of investment going into our pipeline network we added 22 000 customers in british columbia last year 2 customer growth was probably one of the strongest growing natural gas franchises in all of north america and so we re very positive on that business and we re aligning reducing carbon intensity of our product there focusing on renewable natural gas gas for transportation all of these things that are obviously consistent with government policy in alberta across the border we have an electric franchise distribution only alberta still grows our business there by 5 6 a year it s a strong business and we re working obviously through the regulatory regime in alberta it has the thinnest equity in all of canada 37 that s a significant issue and we need to see some improvement there but the distribution network that s comprised of over a million poles is a very strong franchise and we continue to have a good relationship with the previous government and i expect it will be the case with this government and i think that s the benefit of what you get with fortis we have these local teams who are running the business with their local independent boards dealing with the matters that they face within their territories and it s been a pretty successful model for our company and i would expect that that would continue going forward linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you barry v perry president chief executive officer thanks linda operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kuske from credit suisse please go ahead andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst good morning i guess the question starts off with barry and it s just on energy conservation and the efforts behind that how do you think about returns on that business activity this the quirky thing with regulated utilities it s probably the only industry in the world where you re effectively trying to incent people to use less of your product and service barry v perry president chief executive officer well andrew i would just say that we need to keep doing the things that reduce the company s environmental footprint our customers are demanding cleaner energy be delivered obviously always with an eye of affordability i think jurisdictions that go too far too quick run into some trouble and i always use arizona for the poster child for the way to do it they ve gotten greener incrementally every year for the last number of years but yet have kept rates very economic and affordable in that jurisdiction so they re the jurisdiction i think that people should look to so i would say regulators that are progressive enough to think that their utilities can play a major role in improving the portfolio of supply becoming more energy efficient are very progressive because utilities know how to do this and fortis knows how to do it and we can get it done quickly so i think that clearly we are looking for that and when we interact with our regulators we re looking for those opportunities and i would commend the bcuc for being very progressive in terms of this new program that we have in place in british columbia that we get to invest cad 370 million i think over the next four years it does go into rate based but it accelerates these programs very quickly and we will see results from that andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst okay appreciate that and then just maybe an extension on some of the activities you ve got going on in the portfolio and to the first question do you see any broader need to pivot into renewables to a greater degree and directly if you can do rate based renewables and then anything outside of rate based if it s in a contractual framework barry v perry president chief executive officer where we can do renewables within our utilities we would definitely pursue those but i always remind folks that most of our business is just wires and gas pipes so our we re not that involved in the generation side of the business except for arizona and david and his team there working with the corporations commission have done a really good job of improving their portfolio of supply and will continue to do so i think in america obviously renewables have become very attractive in terms of price and this oso grande wind regime david i think we re at 45 capacity factor i think something like that so these are 4 5 megawatt turbines these are great assets and so where we can do more of that we will but you have to remember fortis is more of a t d business without that i don t see us frankly we can try and we will try here and there but competing against the big renewables businesses that are non regulated that s a tough spot to go to and it s hard to make money in that area so really our core focus will be investing in our grid our energy networks as well as improving our portfolio of supply in arizona andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst okay that s great thank you barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you operator if there are any additional questions at this time please press followed by the no you re your telephone keypad your next question comes from the line of patrick kenny from national bank please go ahead patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst hey good morning just a follow up on the question around credit ratings now with the waneta proceeds in the door i m wondering if you could update us on any discussion you might be having with moody s and if there s any visibility or a roadmap to get off of the aa industry rating jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah patrick this is jocelyn yeah i think i can echo barry on this one that we re not happy with the baa3 rating and we do work with moody s to understand it better and we have worked to improve it but we re having normal discussions with moody s and certainly we shared with them our funding plan out of the fall and we updated them even within this past quarter so we re having good discussions with them and they ll go through their normal ratings process but we are looking to improve this rating over the planning period yes barry v perry president chief executive officer and i ll sound defensive on this but i want to remind everyone on the call that we re bbb with dbrs we re bbb with s p and we yes we re baa3 with moody s but a lot of folks forget the other two agencies who rates us very attractively patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst thanks and jocelyn can you just remind us what the target holdco debt to total debt ratio would be for moody s jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer the moody s doesn t actually provide a target i expect it s 30 or lower patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst okay great and then just back to alberta and the regulatory outlook there how should we be thinking about the auc potentially moving to a formula based roe by 2022 i know it s still a ways off but i guess based on the shape of the interest rate curve today i m wondering if you think this represents upside or downside to the 8 5 barry v perry president chief executive officer i can only hope that it represents upside since i can t imagine we can go much lower than where we are but that clearly we patrick we ll be in that process making sure that we put good evidence forward to make sure that those any outcome that would suggest it should be lower than that would not be appropriate clearly regulators will do what they do but i would hope that we could put forward strong evidence to suggest that any outcome that would generate an roe even where we are today is not appropriate patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst okay that s great thanks barry thanks jocelyn operator thank you there are no further questions i would now like

everyone before getting into the quarter results i wanted to take a moment to thank itc s team for quickly and safely restoring power after blizzard conditions brought heavy snowfall ice and high winds to the midwest the storm damaged over 400 poles in southern minnesota and northern iowa last month fortunately itc was able to restore service to its customers within a few days 2019 is off to a strong start we continue to see strong growth in our regulated utility businesses financially and operationally we ve made strides positioning us well to execute on our goals for the year financially adjusted eps was cad 0 74 for the quarter and was up cad 0 04 compared to the previous year reflecting 5 7 eps growth operationally in the quarter we invested cad 740 million at our utilities these investments enhance the service we provide to our customers with an eye on delivering cleaner energy in a safe reliable and affordable manner we remain on track to invest cad 3 7 billion in 2019 and approximately cad 17 billion over the next five years in arizona tucson electric power or tep filed a rate case on april 1st using a 2018 historical test year tep is seeking to recover its investments made since its last rate case supporting customers in the transition to a cleaner energy future including expansion of its wind solar and natural gas generation resources earlier this year we announced that we had entered into an agreement with columbia power corporation and columbia basin trust to sell our 51 interest in the waneta expansion for approximately cad 1 billion during the quarter we progressed through the sale process and we successfully closed the transaction on april 16 lastly in conjunction with the waneta expansion sale we successfully settled a tender offer to repurchase us 400 million of the corporation s outstanding notes due to 2026 at fortis we are committed to reducing our environmental footprint during the quarter three significant milestones were achieved to support this commitment in march tep finalized its plans for construction of the us 370 million oso grande wind project construction of the 247 megawatt wind farm is expected to commence later this year and be online by the end of next year once completed it will become tep s largest renewable energy resource and generate enough power to supply nearly 100 000 homes this project is expected to increase tep s renewable energy production to approximately 28 in 2021 well ahead of the existing state renewable goal of 15 by 2025 and bringing the utility close to a 30 goal planned to be achieved by 2030 although we expect to meet our target well ahead of 2030 we are not stopping there we will continue to pursue new initiatives to support the shift to a lower carbon economy for our customers and we expect to be able to grow beyond the 30 previously targeted for 2030 turning to british columbia fortisbc announced a significant increase it its energy conservation and efficiency program over the next four years the nearly cad 370 million program will be focused on customer initiatives to lower energy use emissions and reduced energy bills these expenditures will increase fortisbc s rate base over the four years these conservation and efficiency enhancements are expected to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 50 000 tons annually which equates to taking close to 11 000 gasoline powered cars off the road a significant milestone was achieved in the wataynikaneyap power project last month when the leave to construct was obtained from the ontario energy board remaining milestones include finalization of environmental approvals which are expected to be received later this year the project is targeted to be completed in 2023 and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the diesel generation currently used by the communities we are confident in our ability to deliver on our cad 17 3 billion capital plan for the period 2019 2023 99 of our planned capital investments are in our regulated businesses the plan consists of a diverse mix of highly executable low risk projects needed to maintain an upgrade our existing infrastructure this capital plan supports our 6 7 average annual rate based growth and translates to over cad 35 billion in rate base in 2023 we remain optimistic in our ability to grow our portfolio of utility businesses our 45 years of dividend increases makes us a leader in dividend growth our strong growth profile coupled with our highly regulated businesses gives us confidence that we will continue this record and grow the dividend at an average annual growth rate of 6 through 2023 i ll now turn the call over to jocelyn for an update on our first quarter results jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer thank you barry and good morning everyone for the first quarter reported eps of cad 0 72 was cad 0 05 lower than last year this was largely due to a one time cad 30 million positive us tax adjustment in 2018 related to our filing of a consolidated state income tax return excluding one time items adjusted eps of cad 0 74 for the quarter was up cad 0 04 compared to the previous year reflecting a 4 7 eps increase our utilities continued to execute on their capital plans with cad 740 million invested during the first quarter now turning to slide 10 i ll take a look at the eps growth on a segmented basis first strong performance at uns and central hudson resulted in a cad 0 03 eps increase during the quarter higher sales at uns energy as a result of colder temperatures and the new rate order at central hudson were the key drivers of this increase central hudson s results were also positive impacted by timing differences associated with the rate order and operating costs these increases were partially offset by planned outage costs at uns a higher us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate favorably impacted the quarter the average rate was cad 1 33 this quarter compared to cad 1 26 in the first quarter last year this increase resulted in a cad 0 02 eps increase itc contributed a cad 0 01 increase to eps during the quarter this was driven by rate based growth partially offset by the reduced roe independence incentive adder our canadian and caribbean utilities increased eps by cad 0 01 driven mainly by rate based growth and higher electricity sales at turks and caicos sales at turks and caicos last year were impacted by hurricane irma offsetting growth at our regulated utilities was a cad 0 02 eps decrease associated with our nonregulated energy infrastructure businesses realized margins were lower at aitken creek and lower rainfall decreased production in belize lastly there was a cad 0 01 eps decrease during the quarter due to a higher number of weighted average common shares as a result of our dividends reinvestment plan the funding plan outlined at investor day this past fall remains intact the majority of the funding required to execute the five year capital plan will come from cash flow our operating cash flows drip proceeds and debt financing at the regulated utilities the atm program remains available to provide additional financing flexibility as barry discussed our recent sale of the waneta hydro plant for approximately cad 1 billion completed the asset sale components of our current capital funding plan net proceeds were used to pay down corporate short term borrowings as well as repurchase a portion of the corporation s outstanding 3 055 note due in 2026 the repayment of holding company debt strengthens our balance sheet improve our credit metrics and further supports our investment grade credit ratings overall we are pleased with the waneta sale we estimate our gain to be approximately cad 415 million and this gain is expected to recognized in the second quarter turning to our 2019 regulatory outlook there was a fair amount of regulatory activity during the first quarter in march ferc issued two notices of inquiry which seek comment on its policies for determining the roe used in setting rates and how to improve its transmission incentive policies to appropriately encourage the development of needed infrastructure to the benefit of our customers itc views the process as an opportunity to demonstrate the value of the independent transmission model as well as advocate for the appropriate incentives to drive needed investments with respect to the roe inquiry ferc is providing an opportunity for all stakeholders beyond those currently involved in new england or miso transmission roe litigations to comment on the new roe methodology we don t expect this will materially impact the miso based roe complaint process and we anticipate that ferc will issue and order later this year fortisbc filed its multiyear rate plan in march as the current term expires at the end of this year the proposed plan seeks approval for a rate setting framework for 2020 through to 2024 cost of capital is not included in its filing and we anticipate a decision in 2020 as barry mentioned tucson electric power filed its rate case april 1st and turning to slide 13 we wanted to spend some time on this filing current rates at tep are based on a mid 2015 test year and do not include approximately us 700 million of rate based investments at the utility since rates were last set these investments were made to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers meet increasing demand and improve the sustainability of our generation portfolio including the integration of over 1 000 megawatts of renewable resources scheduled to be on tep s system by the end of 2020 additional requests include an roe increase of 60 basis points to 10 35 and an equity thickness increase to 53 this equates to a non fuel revenue increase of us 115 million or us 76 million net revenue increase after considering a reduction in fuel costs the reduction in fuel cost is driven by our migration to a cleaner and more balanced resource portfolio tep s proposal translates into an average residential customer bill increase of approximately us 7 61 per month over the past 10 years tep has seen its rate base grow from us 1 billion to us 2 7 billion while keeping average customer rate increases consistently below inflation each year we await a procedural schedule from the arizona corporations commission to determine the timing of proceedings this concludes my remarks i ll now turn the call back to barry barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you jocelyn fortis consists of well run utilities we are now 99 regulated and we are one of the most diversified utility businesses in north america looking ahead our growth profile is strong with over 7 rate based growth expected over the next three years and 6 rate based growth over the next five years this supports our 6 average annual dividend growth guidance to 2023 we continue to focus on growing our utility businesses to summarize through the first quarter the following accomplishments positions us well for the remainder of 2019 we closed the waneta expansion sale for approximately cad 1 billion improved our credit metric outlook by using the waneta proceeds to pay down corporate debt including the cad 400 million us repurchase of notes due in 2026 advanced the wataynikaneyap power project by obtaining the leave to construct from the oeb progressed our commitment to reduce our environmental footprint with the announcement of the oso grande wind project and the fortisbc energy conservation efficiency program filed rate cases at tep and fortisbc and delivered strong eps growth in the quarter i ll now turn the call back over to stephanie stephanie amaimo vice president investor relations thank you barry this concludes the presentation at this time we d like to open the call to address questions from the investment community questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct a question and answer period if you would like to now register a question please press followed by the no 1 on your telephone if your question has been answered and you d like to withdraw your registration please press the sign if you are using a speakerphone please lift your handset before entering your request one moment please for the first question your first question comes from the line of robert kwan from rbc capital markets please go ahead robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst good morning maybe just barry v perry president chief executive officer good morning robert jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer good morning robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst morning maybe just to start with some of the opportunities that are potentially in front of you in bc and just wondering if there s an update on woodfibre lng and i guess generally just thoughts given the gas supply issues we had this past winter barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you robert for your question we continue to work with woodfibre they obviously have asked us to build a pipeline to sell them to get them some gas for their facility they re providing us some funds to do permitting procurement design of the pipeline so we continue to work with them on that and frankly i m probably anxious for them to make a final investment decisions but that s not yet been done so we re hopeful that will come soon and robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst i guess barry v perry president chief executive officer in terms of the i guess resilience and reliability of the gas network i m roger dall antonia is here our ceo of fortisbc he was a fellow that handled that crisis as a result of the enbridge pipeline rupture late last year did a great job for us so he s here for our annual meeting tomorrow and i ll let roger comment on that roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc thanks barry morning robert as far as woodfibre and the enbridge situation woodfibre holds their capacity and they haven t raised any issues with that so we don t see that as a concern and we are working with enbridge just generally on how we re addressing resiliency going forward robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay i guess just with that i m also wondering if woodfibre went ahead are there any discussions with the province or the bcuc and really upside i guess with strengthening whether that s actually getting something done additionally at tilbury or something around southern crossing roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc we re looking at both opportunities it s too early to discuss those plans in front of the bcuc and the government in the next little while as we look at both options robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst got it i can just finish with financing with the waneta divesture squaring up the funding plan i m just wondering what you might be thinking about though past that whether that s funding and making room for new assets or future step up in capital projects as it seems like there s a lot of things in front of you right now or even just streamlining the asset base barry v perry president chief executive officer robert maybe i ll wade in and jocelyn can follow up here but we ve been pretty clear that the cad 17 billion program required us to raise certain proceeds from asset sales and we ve now said the waneta transaction completes that we ve also been clear if our capital does go up that we have our atm program which s cad 500 million currently approved that we would turn that on and that would be we would that is our plan basically clearly if capex went well beyond levels that one could think about we would have to consider other opportunities to raise capital to be clear we are committed to our investment grade credit ratings we would do nothing that would harm those ratings robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst got it so that stands that atm is really the first option here barry v perry president chief executive officer that s correct robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay that s great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ben pham from bmo please go ahead ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay thanks good morning just going back to the waneta sale and you think what divestiture is does your holdco debts outlook that you highlighted at investor day is that are you well ahead of that spot that you presented or is it more of a gradual reduction jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so ben this is jocelyn so at investor day we actually had waneta included in our projections for holdco debt so i think we showed at investor day that holdco was going from 38 down to around 33 32 so we re on track with that plan with the close of the waneta sale ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay so the graphs are still in terms of the timing of waneta it s still more of a gradual reduction that jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yes ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst you bring forward the hold ok all right just wanted to check on that and then the on the just going back to some of the questions on future growth prospects there s a on some of the transmissions stuff in ontario there is a press release mentioning ontario capacity markets could drive your transmission initiatives can you comment a bit on that on why that could increase the probability of erie happening barry v perry president chief executive officer linda apsey s here with us from itc i would just comment obviously ben that we saw that developments in ontario were positive toward making projects like erie connector make more economic sense and we felt it would make some sense for us to come out in support of the initiatives that were occurring there the project still obviously does require a contract a long term contract for it to go ahead and we are not there on that at this point in time but overall the backdrop to some of the changes that are occurring in ontario are positive for the project linda apsey president chief executive officer itc holdings yeah absolutely good morning ben this is linda apsey yeah as barry mentioned certainly with the energy market capacity in market in pjm as well as obviously directional capacity interest in ontario obviously from a bc type project obviously we re trying to bring more attention to the benefits that can be created if you will both in terms of ontario through that transmission line just in the differentials that occurs in terms of capacity pricing in both those different markets so from our perspective capacity market was not something that ontario has i would say a lot of experience in and so bringing more attention to the benefits of a capacity market and the value of a project like the lake erie connector brings we re just really obviously trying to highlight that to continue to be part of the conversation and to continue to advance that project and highlighting the benefits and the need for the projects and continue to drive value for ontario customers ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay that s great and maybe to finish off some of the capex changes on the oso grande wind farm in arizona i m just more curious as the reiteration of the rate base at uns is that just because tax equity is going to pick up a greater share of that debt increase in capex that your rate base isn t changing barry v perry president chief executive officer i don t know if i understand your question ben i don t think that s part of it the are you referring to the cad 700 million rate based growth since the last historical test year in arizona ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst i was thinking more this was the higher megawatts on the oso grande wind farm it s going up by 200 million from previous disclosures and so it s cad 0 2 billion in capex and i m nitpicking a little bit on the numbers but is that you ve opted not to raise or change a rate base with that change so is it because the 200 million a big portion of those tax equity doesn t go to your rate base is that barry v perry president chief executive officer no that s not it ben ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst no okay barry v perry president chief executive officer we just obviously we weren t ready to update our overall program for the year a lot of projects in the cad 17 3 billion so i would say stay tuned for that but this is definitely an increased amount of capital but we haven t yet updated our overall program ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay got it okay thanks everybody operator your next question comes from the line of nicholas campanella from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey congrats on the quarter good morning barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey just looking at the regulatory items i was just curious if you could provide a timeframe if you haven t already on when you think we ll have a resolution for the itc complaints as well as the notice of inquiry barry v perry president chief executive officer linda you want to provide your perspective you re the closest to it so linda apsey president chief executive officer itc holdings good morning nick i mean yeah certainly our view is particularly on the roe the pending roe base complaint we still believe we will see a decision on that yet this year in terms of the notice of inquiries i think those are a little less certain in terms of what ferc will do once they ve received all of the various comments and reply comments i think that s less clear as to what their next steps might be or what their timeline might be but i think clearly we feel as though we will continue to see a decision yet this year on the miso based roe complaints i think we ll have to just wait and see based on the comments and the ferc and the composition of ferc what they might do on those nois nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks i guess just shifting to arizona we all saw the hudbay mine and it sounds like that s going to be your largest customer in the jurisdiction is there any way to quantify how meaningful that is to your top line sales and then if you could just remind us how that reconciles with your longer term forecasts and then perhaps we can talk about incremental opportunities in arizona as well barry v perry president chief executive officer well nick all i can say is that arizona s a pretty big business and we re bringing on a new customer that s going to be our largest customer that s got to be positive right so david s here david do you want to add some other color david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations yeah so our current largest customer is 80 megawatts so it s going to be north of that they re still trying to figure out what equipment they re going to have in their mine design we re working with them through that process over the balance of this year so don t really have a firm estimate of what that top line revenue impact would be but you could probably calculate pretty close yourself if you re looking at that above 80 megawatt type load and a typical capacity factor of a mine so you could probably get pretty close so yeah we re expecting them to start building early next year the transmission line that will serve them we expect that to start later this year and as hudbay has put out for this mine they re expecting that full production to be in by the end of 2022 so that is in our longer term forecast now it s moved around quite a bit over the last two years but that s the timeline that we currently have nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst appreciate it that s it for me thanks again barry v perry president chief executive officer thanks nick operator your next question comes from the line of robert catellier from cibc please go ahead robert catellier cibc world markets analyst hey good morning i was wondering if you could characterize what type of run rate you have to increase renewables at tep and uns given that you re bumping up against some of the renewable portfolio standards there barry v perry president chief executive officer david david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations so the obviously putting in the 250 megwatt oso grande project is going to be a big one for us that s the one that we currently have on our time horizon we expect that to be done by the end of next year that with a couple purchase power agreements that also come in next year will bring our portfolio to over 1 000 megawatts so we ve got we re doing all the plans for integrating not only that 1 000 megawatts but making room for a little more so we don t have a firm number for additional renewable resources that we will build over that near term but just to keep your eye out for our preliminary integrated resource plan that we re going to be filing here in the next couple weeks will show you what those resources look like now and then we re going to go through about a year long stakeholder process get input from our commission other stakeholders and develop a final integrated resource plan that will lay that out in a little bit more detail that won t be finished until about a year form now but it ll give you a pretty good heads up we plan on our current plan is owning any additional renewable energy that we put in the ground for our customers on a going forward basis because the vast majority other than this big wind project has been ppas so that s how you could look at it robert catellier cibc world markets analyst okay and then barry i wanted you to help me with the rate cases in bc you ve been an advocate for canadian regulators to improve the competitiveness of the cost of capital and the roes and the equity thicknesses basically i wondered if you could tell us how the rate applications in bc address that and help make the returns more competitive barry v perry president chief executive officer well this case that we ve field does not include cost of capital so costs of capital in bc it s a separate process rob so we ll obviously once we get to that we will be incorporating our thoughts in that filing i will just be clear to say that the canadian regulatory landscape is inferior to the us landscape our equity thickness is a full 10 points lower than our american businesses and that over the long term is a major competitive issue for canadian companies and it has to be fixed so we but we have to make a case of why it s good for our customers to fix that and we ll be doing that and that is a challenge that fortis is taking on and we re going to work transparently with respect with our regulators in canada to try to improve that situation robert catellier cibc world markets analyst if barry the question was actually in the context of the fact that this rate case doesn t address cost of capital i was wondering if there s any other items in there that help make it more balanced on a risk adjusted basis that might not meet the eye because they re not capital items barry v perry president chief executive officer roger s here to make a comment roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc morning robert just on the application itself traditionally in bc going back to the 90s cost of capital has been set separately that s rate of return as well as equity thickness from rate application so it s not unusual that our multiyear rate plan does not include a specific filing for cost of capital our last decision on cost of capital was 2016 so we do look time to time at financial situations to determine whether we ll be bringing forth a new cost of capital allocation we ve just filed this multiyear rate application as this application rolls forward we ll make another decision on when we think the right time is to bring forth a new cost of capital application as far as the application itself it s really an extension of the existing pvr they have a different focus the current pvr was really rooted in productivity efficiency on both o m and capital this program maintains this application maintains many of the same elements but it s more of a focus on targeted incentives around low carbon energy on demand side management and innovation so it s not directly changing in our view it s more of an extension of our current regulatory construct not a large departure so we don t see it having an impact right now on our view of cost of capital robert catellier cibc world markets analyst okay thank you very much barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you rob operator your next question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank please go ahead robert hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone want to circle back with rosemont just want to get a sense of when the relatively short transmission line to the mine would be completed as well as appreciate david s comments on load but just want to get a sense of how much load do you think you re going to get that project during the construction of it barry v perry president chief executive officer so rob you re peeling you want to peel the onion robert hope scotiabank analyst a little bit david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations i guess i was a little too vague purposely so because they still are developing their mining plan as far as the construction goes we should have that line built by the end of next year it s only a 13 mile route so the engineering is mostly done we have been doing prep work for that for years so it s all permitted and ready to go we just need to get it in time for them to start their operations but yeah i really can t say much more about the expected load there robert hope scotiabank analyst all right so let s do a broader question then so barry when you look at the overall market and the very strong valuations we re seeing on energy infrastructure items either majority or minority interests how do you weigh further strengthening the balance sheet versus your existing asset suite barry v perry president chief executive officer well first of all rob i take you back to the fact that we laid out a strong funding plan for the existing capital program and we re executing well on that plan and that does see our credit metrics improve over time so we ll start there but i would say frankly any offers we would receive on assets that would be similar to or better than what we got for waneta everything is for sale at those levels any ceo of a large public company would have to entertain those kinds of offers and i don t see those showing up but if they did appear for certain of our assets we would have to look at them david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations barry i could add a little color related to rosemont because one of the things that you re talking about the transmission line i think it s important to point out that we don t pay for that transmission line rosemont is paying the cad 30 million it ll take to construct that so when you look at from a customer perspective and that cash flow versus investment we have to make absolutely zero investment in order to serve rosemont so that s a really nice asset to have joining our company with a customer that size zero additional infrastructure need and obviously a big customer so that might provide a little bit of color for that later period cash topic robert hope scotiabank analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david quezada from raymond james please go ahead david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst thanks morning everyone my first question here just on wataynikaneyap just curious if there s any color you can provide on the permitting process and just if you could comment at all on whether or not that s going as expected barry v perry president chief executive officer it s going very well and gary smith who heads up that project for us is here gary you want to give an update gary j smith executive vice president eastern canadian and caribbean operations yeah we ve been at the permitting process for for sure pretty hard now for a couple of years and we ve met all the requirements in the permitting process the file now is in front of the minister to make a decision we just think there s a little bit more time required for them to digest the information we ve provided but we don t see any critical hurdles in our way to stop the project from moving forward so we do expect to get a decision soon but again exactly when that will be later this year is undetermined david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst okay that s good color thank you and maybe just one other one i realize this is a longer term opportunity but just on big chino if you had any early consultations with stakeholders there and how that process has been going barry v perry president chief executive officer well big chino is an interesting project obviously theoretically it s a great project for the region to have long durations of pump storage it would greatly enhance the ability of the region southwest region to bring more renewables onto the grid solar wind that being said it is a big project that would take seven eight years to complete and so we re evaluating our involvement in that project at this point in time and continuing to do certain initiatives there but i would say that it s a project we ll be making a decision on this year whether we continue to put development dollars into it going forward david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst okay fair enough thank you for that that s all for me operator your next question comes from the line of linda ezergailis with td securities please go ahead linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you i m wondering if you could help us understand whether your current funding plan addresses or should eliminate the negative outlook that s p has or how you feel about defending your s p rating versus potentially a downgrade barry v perry president chief executive officer well i would hope that they would remove it related to our strong execution in investing in our regulated businesses linda we re continuing to have good dialogue with s p i would not expect any immediate actions from them jocelyn you want to add jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i just i would say that the negative outlook stems from obviously post us tax reform and so any us tax reform was as expected for us and we do expect to get back to a metric similar to pre us tax reform in a few years so i suspect that that will create even better dialogue with s p barry v perry president chief executive officer yeah and linda to be clear i d like bbb unsecured debt rating with s p linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you that s helpful and maybe we can move on to aitken creek i realize that it s hard to predict that earnings stream but maybe you can help us see year to date what you re seeing both from a volume and margin perspective and beyond just help and deleveraging or funding would maybe moving that asset to rate based or for the right price exiting help your risk profile from a business risk perspective with rating agencies or some other strategic benefit barry v perry president chief executive officer i would say in a perfect world linda roger is sitting right next to me here so i would like to see that asset in regulated operations it is a critical asset for the management of the gas network in western canada and our utility fortisbc uses a lot of the capacity of the plant that s something we ll be thinking about in the future in terms of performance in the quarter and longer term performance i think since we bought it the asset has done very well it s actually i would say outperformed our expectations there s some potential to also expand the asset a little bit so roger maybe you can add some color on where we are in the quarter and some of the reasons why that we had a light quarter roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc yeah thanks barry morning linda i think the main driver is q1 2018 there s a couple of things happening that were not prevalent in 2019 so we had a colder regional winter q4 17 q1 18 relative to what we experienced in 2019 we had a very mild winter in the region pacific northwest and we experienced winter more into february and into march than the previous year so we had a greater demand for gas power storage q1 2018 we also had some maintenance constraints so gas prices were generally higher so there was a significant amount of gas pulled out of the ground in 2018 we are closing off deals and realizing the value of the market at the time 2019 partly because of weather and the enbridge situation there was lower prices so we were injecting more than withdrawing in the quarter that s really the driver we feel that q1 2019 was a good quarter but not as strong as 18 because of those factors linda ezergailis td securities analyst and can you comment on the scale of a potential expansion and the timing what factors need to be in place to expand that asset roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc we are just connecting to the north artery which is a small expansion of the system we are looking at development of the north aitken field that would be a few years away we don t have specific capital estimates yet it s really going to be determinant on market factors in the next two to three years so more to come on that one barry v perry president chief executive officer but fairly small in terms of capital roger roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc yeah less maybe cad 100 million linda ezergailis td securities analyst and what factors would need to be in place to move it to rate based roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc just lng development natural gas expansion in the pacific northwest ongoing increased demand for natural gas which we think is positive but those things will develop over time linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you and maybe just a final high level strategic question i guess for barry given some of the recent changes in provincial governments how has that affected your strategic lens and outlook on those geographies and does that increase the urgency to address some of your cost of capital issues you have with canada or might there be some opportunities to potentially to nonregulated assets in those geographies can you comment on i guess alberta and to a lesser extent ontario and anywhere else specifically that you think there s been a change in policy that might help or affect your business barry v perry president chief executive officer that s a big question linda i ll try to address it we re not overly interested in nonregulated assets other than i would say things like lng tolling or the contracted transmission that the erie connector would be involved in so things that look and feel like regulated items i would say in terms of the region we have a very positive relationship with the government in british columbia our natural gas business is doing well there a fair amount of investment going into our pipeline network we added 22 000 customers in british columbia last year 2 customer growth was probably one of the strongest growing natural gas franchises in all of north america and so we re very positive on that business and we re aligning reducing carbon intensity of our product there focusing on renewable natural gas gas for transportation all of these things that are obviously consistent with government policy in alberta across the border we have an electric franchise distribution only alberta still grows our business there by 5 6 a year it s a strong business and we re working obviously through the regulatory regime in alberta it has the thinnest equity in all of canada 37 that s a significant issue and we need to see some improvement there but the distribution network that s comprised of over a million poles is a very strong franchise and we continue to have a good relationship with the previous government and i expect it will be the case with this government and i think that s the benefit of what you get with fortis we have these local teams who are running the business with their local independent boards dealing with the matters that they face within their territories and it s been a pretty successful model for our company and i would expect that that would continue going forward linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you barry v perry president chief executive officer thanks linda operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kuske from credit suisse please go ahead andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst good morning i guess the question starts off with barry and it s just on energy conservation and the efforts behind that how do you think about returns on that business activity this the quirky thing with regulated utilities it s probably the only industry in the world where you re effectively trying to incent people to use less of your product and service barry v perry president chief executive officer well andrew i would just say that we need to keep doing the things that reduce the company s environmental footprint our customers are demanding cleaner energy be delivered obviously always with an eye of affordability i think jurisdictions that go too far too quick run into some trouble and i always use arizona for the poster child for the way to do it they ve gotten greener incrementally every year for the last number of years but yet have kept rates very economic and affordable in that jurisdiction so they re the jurisdiction i think that people should look to so i would say regulators that are progressive enough to think that their utilities can play a major role in improving the portfolio of supply becoming more energy efficient are very progressive because utilities know how to do this and fortis knows how to do it and we can get it done quickly so i think that clearly we are looking for that and when we interact with our regulators we re looking for those opportunities and i would commend the bcuc for being very progressive in terms of this new program that we have in place in british columbia that we get to invest cad 370 million i think over the next four years it does go into rate based but it accelerates these programs very quickly and we will see results from that andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst okay appreciate that and then just maybe an extension on some of the activities you ve got going on in the portfolio and to the first question do you see any broader need to pivot into renewables to a greater degree and directly if you can do rate based renewables and then anything outside of rate based if it s in a contractual framework barry v perry president chief executive officer where we can do renewables within our utilities we would definitely pursue those but i always remind folks that most of our business is just wires and gas pipes so our we re not that involved in the generation side of the business except for arizona and david and his team there working with the corporations commission have done a really good job of improving their portfolio of supply and will continue to do so i think in america obviously renewables have become very attractive in terms of price and this oso grande wind regime david i think we re at 45 capacity factor i think something like that so these are 4 5 megawatt turbines these are great assets and so where we can do more of that we will but you have to remember fortis is more of a t d business without that i don t see us frankly we can try and we will try here and there but competing against the big renewables businesses that are non regulated that s a tough spot to go to and it s hard to make money in that area so really our core focus will be investing in our grid our energy networks as well as improving our portfolio of supply in arizona andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst okay that s great thank you barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you operator if there are any additional questions at this time please press followed by the no you re your telephone keypad your next question comes from the line of patrick kenny from national bank please go ahead patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst hey good morning just a follow up on the question around credit ratings now with the waneta proceeds in the door i m wondering if you could update us on any discussion you might be having with moody s and if there s any visibility or a roadmap to get off of the aa industry rating jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah patrick this is jocelyn yeah i think i can echo barry on this one that we re not happy with the baa3 rating and we do work with moody s to understand it better and we have worked to improve it but we re having normal discussions with moody s and certainly we shared with them our funding plan out of the fall and we updated them even within this past quarter so we re having good discussions with them and they ll go through their normal ratings process but we are looking to improve this rating over the planning period yes barry v perry president chief executive officer and i ll sound defensive on this but i want to remind everyone on the call that we re bbb with dbrs we re bbb with s p and we yes we re baa3 with moody s but a lot of folks forget the other two agencies who rates us very attractively patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst thanks and jocelyn can you just remind us what the target holdco debt to total debt ratio would be for moody s jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer the moody s doesn t actually provide a target i expect it s 30 or lower patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst okay great and then just back to alberta and the regulatory outlook there how should we be thinking about the auc potentially moving to a formula based roe by 2022 i know it s still a ways off but i guess based on the shape of the interest rate curve today i m wondering if you think this represents upside or downside to the 8 5 barry v perry president chief executive officer i can only hope that it represents upside since i can t imagine we can go much lower than where we are but that clearly we patrick we ll be in that process making sure that we put good evidence forward to make sure that those any outcome that would suggest it should be lower than that would not be appropriate clearly regulators will do what they do but i would hope that we could put forward strong evidence to suggest that any outcome that would generate an roe even where we are today is not appropriate patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst okay that s great thanks barry thanks jocelyn operator thank you there are no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to ms amaimo for closing remarks stephanie amaimo thank you jessa we have nothing further at this time thank you everyone for participating in our first quarter 2019 results call

quarterly reports filed with the sec i ll now turn the call over to willy willy walker chairman and chief executive officer thank you kelsey and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning to review our performance for the first quarter of 2019 our strongest q1 financial results to date we had a fantastic start to the year driven by consistent execution by our team continued benefits from our strategic growth initiatives and a supportive macroeconomic environment during 2018 we invested considerable energy and capital to expand our mortgage banking and property sales platforms these investments are reflected in first quarter 2019 revenues 187 million up 27 from first quarter last year as shown on slide three strong top line growth coupled with continued expense management and increased economies of scale and our servicing platform generated diluted earnings per share of 1 39 a 22 increase over q1 2018 steve will dive into our financial performance in more details in a bit but one of the areas he will highlight are the cash generating components of our business model and their dramatic growth in the first quarter pushing adjusted ebitda to over 60 million for the first time ever to a record 67 million up 28 over q1 of last year our first quarter financial performance is emblematic of how we have grown walker dunlop by establishing long term highly ambitious goals investing in people systems and technology to achieve those goals and then executing daily for our clients the commercial real estate industry was very active during the first quarter and our team took advantage of the market opportunity by generating total transaction volume of 5 9 billion a 23 increase year over year the breakout of our quarterly total transaction volume is shown on slide four total mortgage banking volume was up 16 to 5 2 billion led by fannie mae originations of 2 billion up 60 from the first quarter of 2018 our freddie mac originations were also strong 1 6 billion a 19 increase from q1 2018 82 of our total fannie and freddie volume was fixed rate reflecting borrower s desire to lock in long term financing as rates rallied in the quarter due to slower global economic growth and the dovish stance taken by the federal reserve with regard to future rate increases with historically high amounts of capital focused on investing in commercial real estate and the rallying rates during q1 acquisition activity was very robust driving walker dunlop s q1 multi family property sales volume to nearly 700 million up 106 from last year we made significant investments in property sales teams in boston dallas and los angeles last year and with those teams fully integrated we expect to see continued year over year growth in our property sales volume for the remainder of the year as anticipated and discussed in our last earnings call our hud originations were down year over year to 178 million due to the government shutdown that lasted nearly all of january brokered debt originations of 1 4 billion was a healthy start to the year but down 9 from q1 of 2018 we expect to see year over year growth in debt brokerage due to the significant investments we have made to add mortgage bankers with strong client relationships across the country our principal lending and investing volume which includes lending activities through our joint venture with blackstone loans we originate on our balance sheet and loans we originate for separate accounts managed by our fund management platform jcr capital totaled 76 million in the first quarter this was a slow start to the year but as our financial results this quarter show the robust origination volume in q4 of last year generated meaningful interest income in the first quarter we will continue to use our balance sheet for selective lending opportunities to assist our borrowers and maintain our focus on deploying as much capital as possible in our blackstone joint venture and separate accounts we manage we ended the quarter with 1 4 billion of assets under management and jcr capital is currently marketing its fifth fund which will add new capital strategies for our bankers and brokers to sell as you can see on slide five the sustained growth in our mortgage origination business has produced dramatic growth in our loan servicing portfolio which has increased on average 10 billion per year every year over the past five years to 88 billion today with a weighted average servicing fee of 24 basis points and a weighted average life of 9 8 years our servicing portfolio continues to gain value at a rapid pace servicing income along with other non transaction related revenue streams such as interest income totaled 44 of revenues in q1 of this year these cash revenues are earned regardless of our level of transaction activity in a given quarter and make our business model exceptionally durable i ll now turn the call over to steve to discuss our q1 financial performance in more details steve steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you willy and good morning everyone our team kicked off 2019 with a very strong first quarter delivery in revenue and adjusted ebitda growth in excess of 25 our financial results were powered by a great quarter of agency originations the continued growth in our servicing portfolio and its related revenues and the deployment of capital to our balance sheet lending program our key metrics during the quarter demonstrate just how good a start to the year this was q1 eps of 1 39 was up from 1 14 last year an increase of 22 adjusted ebitda was 67 million for the quarter a record and nearly 28 higher than q1 2018 as you can see on slide six operating margin was 30 and return on equity was 20 both in the mid to upper end of our target ranges finally gain on sale margin was 190 basis points well above our target range and slightly better than first quarter of last year let me highlight some of the important drivers of our q1 results total mortgage banking originations of 5 2 billion included 3 7 billion of agency lending volume that compared to 2 9 billion in q1 2018 the increase in agency volumes contributed to the 21 year over year increase in mortgage banking gains benefiting each of our key metrics in particular the high volume of fannie mae business in the quarter pushed the overall gain on sale margin to 190 basis points well above the target range of 150 basis points to 170 basis points this out performance was driven almost entirely by business mix as the overall margins on our various origination types was little changed from what we saw in the fourth quarter while we love doing 38 of our mortgage banking volume with fannie mae this weighting is higher than our recent historical average and we fully expect that we will do more freddie and brokered business in the coming quarters as a result we are maintaining our gain on sale margin forecast range of 150 basis points to 170 basis points our 30 operating margin was unchanged from the first quarter of last year reflecting both the increase in revenue and the increase in expenses from the investments we made in 2018 acquiring jcr and icap and adding mortgage bankers and property sales brokers to the platform in addition the increase in transaction volumes year over year has led to increases in both commission and bonus compensation expense this quarter compared to q1 of last year personnel as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 37 in q1 2018 to 38 in q1 2019 largely due to the aforementioned increases in variable compensation during the quarter we acquired a small technology company that has developed a variety of tools to automate components of the loan underwriting process this team of talented software engineers and data scientists will help us drive efficiencies and speed to market not just in our loan underwriting but in our loan origination and servicing operations as well we are super excited about the capabilities this team brings to our company and look forward to telling you more about what we were up to in the future this quarter s expenses include 2 7 million of provision for credit losses compared to a benefit in the prior year of 500 000 during the quarter we booked specific provisions for two loans one a 21 million student housing deal in our fannie mae at risk portfolio and the second a 14 7 million loan on a memory care facility in our interim portfolio we don t believe these two loans represent a new trend or signal a turn in credit but rather are isolated instances in what otherwise remains a benign credit environment as there are no other delinquent loans in our at risk or interim portfolios at this time in addition during the quarter the average ltv and debt service coverage ratio for new loans made was 65 and 1 39 times consistent with what we have seen for the past few years and still at levels we are very comfortable lending our effective tax rate during the quarter was 21 compared to 16 in the first quarter of last year as we have previously mentioned for the last few years we have recognized additional tax benefits with divesting of employee stock grants due to the appreciation in the share price from the date of grant to the date of vest most of this benefit is recognized in the first quarter as that is when the majority of our employee stock grants vest this year that benefit amounted to approximately 0 11 per share compared to 0 13 cents last year and is the primary reason this quarter s effective tax rate is only 21 going forward our effective tax rate for future quarters should be somewhere between 26 and 27 turning to slide seven adjusted ebitda achieved record 66 7 million this quarter an increase of 28 over last year primarily driven by increases in origination fees servicing fees and interest income the servicing portfolio grew to just shy of 88 billion an increase of 16 over the year ago quarter interest income grew by 278 as decreases in agency warehouse interest income from an inverted yield curve were more than offset by increases in interest on escrow deposits investments in pledge securities and interim loans we ended the quarter with 110 million of cash on the balance sheet with another 255 million of capital supporting our interim loan portfolio the refinance and upsize of our term loan b in november of last year allowed us to increase our principal lending business through the use of our balance sheet on a short term basis as we discussed last quarter our interim loan portfolio grew to nearly 500 million at the end of the year with an average remaining maturity of eight months the portfolio now sits at just over 470 million based on pay downs during the quarter we expect to continue recycling capital in this portfolio to deepen the relationship with our customers and provide additional opportunities for permanent financing in the future our strong cash position and financial results also support our quarterly dividend payment yesterday our board of directors authorized a dividend of 0 30 per share payable to common shareholders of record on may 17 2019 representing the payout ratio of only 20 of net income we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2019 these results once again demonstrate the power of our unique business model which coupled to the strong balance sheet with a growing servicing portfolio providing us with the ongoing ability to both invest in our future and return capital to shareholders while also earning above market returns on that capital i d like to thank you all for joining us this morning and i ll now turn the call back over to willy willy walker chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve housing finance reform became a topic of discussion on capitol hill almost immediately after fannie mae and freddie mac were taken into conservatorship in september of 2008 during the great financial crisis it is important to remember that walker dunlop acquired column guaranteed from credit suisse four months after fannie and freddie were placed into conservatorship we made that bet understanding the vital role that gses play in the us housing finance market and we benefited tremendously from that investment we also acquired cwcapital from fortress investment group in 2012 after the republicans took control of the house of representatives and began calling for an end to fannie and freddie and similar to the column acquisition the acquisition of cwcapital was widely beneficial to our company and shareholder returns we have made large strategic acquisitions in the agency lending space that have benefited us tremendously due to our understanding of the economics and politics surrounding the gses we are very supportive of many of the ideas and initiatives being discussed by both the trump administration and senate banking committee with regard to housing finance reform the white house recently released a presidential executive order that calls for an end to the conservatorship of the gses senator mike crapo chairman of the senate banking committee released an outline of the legislation his committee is hoping to draft and pass that calls for an end to conservatorship and the potential privatization of fannie mae and freddie mac s multifamily businesses we are encouraged by these efforts to end conservatorship and either create a multi guarantor model or turn fannie mae and freddie mac into utility light public companies with an established rate of return and significant regulatory oversight while there will be hearings proposals and plenty of regulatory and legislative ideas themes and initiatives between now and any ultimate administrative or legislative reform we are confident that fannie and freddie s multifamily businesses will endure due to their negligible losses during the great financial crisis their core business models which placed private capital ahead of public capital and their mandates and missions of providing financing for the largest and fastest growing source of affordable housing in america apartments our current outlook for the remainder of the year is positive given the macroeconomic fundamentals that are driving continued investor appetite in commercial real estate recent economic forecasts for 2019 gdp growth in the low 2 range with a core inflation rate near the fed s target of 2 and a sustained low level of unemployment if wages and oil don t spike the fed should remain on the sidelines with regard to further rate hikes leaving short and long term rates at very attractive levels for commercial real estate investment household formation should continue around 1 million households per year yet as we have discussed before the dearth of new entry level single family housing is pushing the value of existing entry level single family housing higher and higher and so while the economy continues to expand and many americans would normally be looking to move from multi family housing to owning a single family home there is limited new supply which is making the existing housing stock more and more expensive as shown on slide eight the average price of existing single family inventory has steadily risen from 267 000 in 2015 to 299 000 in 2018 a 12 increase while the supply of existing homes has decreased by 14 over that time this phenomena is keeping renters renting and forcing them to not only start households in multi family housing but start families there to further this point the us homeownership rate dropped in the first quarter of 2019 for the first time in two years by 60 basis points to 64 2 reversing a two year trend of upward movement the fact that this downward shift occurred in a quarter that saw declines in 30 year mortgage rates reflects the significant barriers to homeownership that first time homebuyers are currently facing this macro trend will support continued strength in the financial performance of multifamily assets and the loans we have on them 2 to 3 gdp growth and the 10 year treasury between ph 250 and 3 has been an extremely strong macroeconomic environment for the dramatic growth in commercial real estate since the great financial crisis and with those same economic conditions looking likely for the foreseeable future we see continued strength a survey of investors by preqin at the end of 2018 revealed that 81 of investors expect that their capital commitments to real estate over the next 12 months will either remain the same or increase as compared with the previous 12 months global investors continue to find opportunities in the commercial real estate sector particularly in the united states that offer attractive returns relative to other asset classes based on preqin s real estate index shown on slide nine north america focused real estate funds have outperformed all other regions since 2011 at the end of march a record 327 billion of capital sat in real estate private equity funds and over 65 of that capital or 213 billion is targeted toward north america all of these macroeconomic trends create a very positive operating environment for our business as we enter the second quarter we operate in an incredibly competitive market yet walker dunlop is in the unique position of competing head to head with global firms while still being a small entrepreneurial company with nimble and efficient operations it is that magical combination of big company capabilities with the touch and feel of a small family company that differentiates us from the competition w d was recently ranked as the sixth best workplace in the financial services industry by fortune magazine sixth among the thousands of financial services companies across the country it is our unique corporate culture that centers around our customer service that sets us apart from the competition and allows us to continue to attract the very best professionals in our industry i would like to thank all my colleagues at walker dunlop for a great start to 2019 and as always thank our shareholders for your investment and trust in walker dunlop i will now ask catherine to open the line for any questions questions and answers operator the floor is now opened for questions operator instructions thank you our first question is coming from steve delaney with jmp securities your line is now open steve delaney jmp securities analyst thank you congratulations on the strong start to 2019 willy if i could start with you we ve been watching monthly the gse delivery reports the new business reports and quite a reversal in 2019 versus 2018 in terms of fannie mae s aggressiveness on a relative basis where we re showing them up 26 over freddie mac in the first quarter any comments there as to what s going on what s different this year than last year between the two and should we think about in terms of the mix more fannie and more fixed as you showed in your slide deck certainly is positive for the overall margins thank you willy walker chairman and chief executive officer good morning steve and thanks for joining us i wouldn t go out too much into it steve as you know very well fannie and freddie both if you will wax and wane quarter by quarter as it relates to their client base their partners with companies like walker dunlop general pipelines and if one tends to get too much ahead of the other then the other kind of gets aggressive and gets back up and catches up to them and so you know as you ve seen for many many years it s quarter to quarter there are variations but by the end of the year they both sort of end up in the same spot so i wouldn t as it relates to overall annual volumes which is what we re very focused on i wouldn t read too much into it with all that said as you know last year we were fannie s second largest partner and we ve been their largest partner for four of the last six years we have a very strong partnership with them and we also have great clients who come to walker dunlop for that execution and so it was a great quarter and we expect to continue to do a big volume of fannie mae for the rest of the year steve delaney jmp securities analyst thanks and a lot of comments this morning this quarter about interest income obviously with the fed hikes last year escrows kicking in more but that s not something as far as the on balance sheet loans et cetera that you ve really emphasized in the past obviously it s recurring has some nice features is that something that you expect to continue to grow and would you consider acquiring additional capital to build a larger on balance sheet loan portfolio thanks willy walker chairman and chief executive officer yes steve i think historically we ve used balance sheet i would say more opportunistically we do as you well know generate a lot of capital through operations and we ve invested that in both growing the business through m a as well as allocating some of that capital to the on balance sheet portfolio i wouldn t anticipate any change in strategy there i think we still view that as a way for us to deepen the relationship with the customer you know we re getting the good return off the capital we re deploying there and then we re obviously hoping to do agency execution on the back end on all of those loans once they are ready for permanent financing steve delaney jmp securities analyst got it so still more of a strategic synergy thing than sort of a separate capital allocation strategy it sounds like okay thanks and steve since i have you can you give us an update on producer headcount currently and in terms of your business plan for 2019 do you have a specific goal for producer growth steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think as we ve put out there in the past i think we re looking to grow 10 to 15 on the producer headcount again this year we re continuing to be pretty active on the recruiting front to try to get after that willy walker chairman and chief executive officer i think we re right around 170 multiple speakers 168 steve delaney jmp securities analyst 168 okay great okay thank you gentlemen appreciate the comments operator operator instructions our next question is coming from jade rahmani with kbw your line is now open jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much in terms of the strategic outlook does the hff pending sale to jll change your thinking lots of talk in the industry about consolidation and potential cross selling of products across platforms and across client bases do you think that walker dunlop would complement a larger platform well and is that something that you and the board have considered willy walker chairman and chief executive officer good morning jade how are you jade rahmani kbw analyst good thanks willy walker chairman and chief executive officer great so i d say first of all to the point about cross selling our q1 numbers i haven t seen everybody report but our q1 numbers are either above or right at the very fastest growing numbers for our competitive set so we clearly have been able to grow dramatically and put up fantastic financial results without having all of those additional cross selling things that many people talk about so i would say that we have continued to grow faster than the competition staying focused on our customers and focused on our core business and as you well know we go up against the largest commercial real estate services firms and the largest commercial banks in the world and we compete very successfully given our focus on our market and the way we go to market so i would just say to you that the hff jll transaction furthers the theme of consolidation in our industry but i d also say that the removal of hff from the landscape as a very client focused to some degree boutique firm like walker dunlop actually creates space for us to continue doing what we re doing and remain very focused on our core business strategy and obviously our growth in numbers sort of speak for themselves as our ability to continue to scale and grow in a highly competitive market on our own so hats off to the hff team for what looks like a fantastic transaction and as you can imagine we re watching the integration of jll hff very closely jade rahmani kbw analyst and in terms of the broader strategic outlook m a opportunities historically as you mentioned walker dunlop has been acquisitive are you seeing a healthy transaction or potential transaction environment for properties that might be complementary and also as we think about risks beyond gse reform just a decline in potentially the gse s market share in multifamily does that change your thinking about the types of assets you might consider acquiring willy walker chairman and chief executive officer yes so as you know we ve been quite acquisitive on the mortgage banking mortgage debt brokerage side over the past couple of years we continue to look for acquisition opportunities in that space and obviously have nothing to report at this time but as you know we re constantly looking i would say as it relates to the core business the macro environment is just extremely healthy right now and what we ve been able to do is build out a loan origination platform that essentially gives us access to deal flow that we can then take and take to various sources of capital so whether it s an agency loan whether it s a hud loan whether it s a life insurance company loan whether it s a cmbs loan whether it s for our blackstone joint venture whether it s for our balance sheet or whether it s for one of the funds that we now manage at jcr capital the business strategy that we outlined five years ago we have executed on which is to gain access to deal flow and then raise capital that we control and then deploy that capital to meet our clients needs so certainly the gse business is a great business we ve created an extremely strong brand and reputation in that space but we also have access to other sources of capital that we both broker to and also control that allows us to basically meet our clients needs regardless of whether the agencies are very active in the market as they were in q1 or less active in the market as steve delaney said previously as they were in some quarters of 2018 steve delaney jmp securities analyst turning to the tech side i think you know in the past you made a tech investment in a inaudible company that or data analytics company and that company was later sold and steve mentioned a small tech company acquisition this quarter to drive efficiencies and servicing are there any hidden sources of value within walker dunlop s servicing portfolio in terms of the data that it generates the number of properties all the touch points the historical performance that could become a source of value in the future by using that data analytically willy walker chairman and chief executive officer so we as steve outlined in his comments the acquisition we made in q1 is very much focused on streamlining our loan underwriting process and we had a presentation to our board yesterday that was absolutely fantastic on taking that technology and implementing it w d that s really a cost focused investment right now to try and make us more efficient in what we do and also allow us to underwrite loans quicker to get responses back to our clients faster all of that then plays into having better insight into the loans that we are underwriting the properties that we re underwriting and using that data to become more insightful into where opportunities lie as well as having data and information that we can share with our customers to make them more insightful about where they re making their investments so i think the broad answer to your question jade is yes very much so the more specific answer to your question as it relates to where we re focused right now is getting that technology implemented and streamlining some of our operations jade rahmani kbw analyst just on the fhfa side beyond whatever happens on gse reform when if it ever happens do you have any thoughts around whether pre emptively calabria might move to curtail the gse s market share at all in multifamily whether it s revisiting the caps through on the quarterly review process or do you have any concerns that particularly fannie mae s resurgence in volumes might draw his attention to that market share willy walker chairman and chief executive officer so i have no ability to figure out what draws director calabria s attention to anything what i do know is what i read in the papers and what i hear from people who have met with him so you may have seen the wall street journal article last week where the director clearly stated that he has no intentions to change the footprints of fannie and freddie in the short term and so he s on record in the wall street journal as saying that the american banker had an article on interview with him as well that i would say was extremely constructive and positive as it relates to how the director is looking at the markets today and we obviously know several people who have been in to meet with the director since he s been in the seat and everything i ve gotten back so far is that he is taking a very measured approach he is taking a long term outlook to his role as being the director of the fhfa and the one other thing that he shared in both the wall street journal article as well as he mentioned anecdotally is that he does not want to get ahead of congress that he understands that congress really wants to play a role here and as such he s looking for a legislative reform before he s looking for administrative reform so i think all of that is a very positive landscape and as we said in our call jade we support the efforts to end conservatorship and given that there is private capital ahead of public capital in every loan that is originated by freddie mac and the great majority of loans that are originated by fannie mae and side by side with public capital in the other portion of fannie mae s multifamily lending the model works and we have great confidence that the model will stay in place i don t want to say regardless of what happens to the agencies but as you well know the entire discussion has changed dramatically over the past couple of years and the role of the federal government in the secondary mortgage market is pretty well established it s just a matter of trying to end conservatorship and what changes come about in that process jade rahmani kbw analyst just lastly turning to credit you noted that there were two loan defaults i wanted to see if you could give any color there on recent credit trends if that signals anything and in particular one of the loan defaults was in the interim loan book was that within the bx inaudible jv and just what drove those two situations steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer jade i ll take that one one i think the high level answer to your question is we don t believe either those two loans signals any trend from a credit standpoint one was a student housing property one was a memory care facility so neither were a market rate multifamily property they are the only delinquent loans in portions of the portfolios that we have credit risk on the ilp loan was on our balance sheet not in the bx joint venture so again i think our view was there s no trend here no change in the credit outlook just two isolated instances they happened to happen in the same quarter jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator we have no further questions i will turn the floor back over to willy walker for any additional remarks willy walker chairman and chief executive officer thank you everyone for joining us this morning great first quarter and we hope all of you have a terrific day thank you

thanks trisha good morning and thanks for joining us today we delivered a solid first quarter in line with our sales and adjusted eps guidance we achieved revenue of 406 million and our adjusted eps of 1 96 was above the midpoint of our guidance range during the first quarter we continued to see good design win activity across the electronics industrial and transportation end markets we serve driven by the strong fundamentals of the business and the content opportunities driven by a safer cleaner and more connected world later i will provide more commentary on the performance of the business with ongoing softness in global auto production and excess channel inventories in electronics we anticipate soft demand to persist we continue to expect improving conditions in the second half of the year despite slower growth in some areas of our end markets we remain well positioned to continue the execution of our 5 year strategy of double digit sales and earnings growth we ve demonstrated in the past we will deliver exceptional value for our shareholders by driving above market sales growth leveraging our operational excellence and managing our costs to align to business conditions with that brief introduction i will now turn the call over to meenal to provide additional color on our financial results meenal anil sethna cfo thanks dave and good morning everyone i ll start with highlights from our first quarter of 2019 sales of 406 million met guidance and as projected we re down 3 overall and 4 organically versus last year foreign exchange headwind of 2 was higher than we had projected while acquisitions net of business exit added 3 sales growth sales across our electronics and industrial segments finished largely as we expected our automotive segment sales were slightly softer than our expectation global car build excluding japan where we have limited automotive sales was down 7 a greater decline than we had expected gaap operating margins were 15 while adjusted operating margins finished at 16 2 sequentially adjusted operating margins improved 110 basis points on essentially flat sales more than offsetting foreign exchange headwind this improvement was a combination of our team s ongoing efforts to contain costs while driving ongoing benefits from ixys synergy initiatives first quarter gaap diluted eps was 1 48 gaap eps included 12 million in after tax charges mainly due to nonoperating foreign exchange losses as well as acquisition integration and restructuring charges adjusted diluted eps of 1 96 for the quarter was above our guidance midpoint of 1 93 foreign exchange headwinds along with negative mark to market comparisons reduced adjusted eps by about 0 27 compared to last year lower volumes and associated leverage partially offset by lower expenses resulting from our ixys synergies and cost containment efforts drove the remainder of our eps decline over last year our gaap effective tax rate was 20 3 for the quarter our adjusted effective tax rate was 19 7 essentially flat to last year now let me provide some additional performance highlights by product segment for the first quarter currency headwinds followed by lower year over year sales volumes and leverage had the largest impact to our company operating margin the volume and leverage drop have the greatest margin impact within our electronics segment excess inventory reductions at our channel partners was the main driver of volume decline this volume impact more than offset benefits from the ixys cost synergies that we had started to drive in the first quarter last year our automotive margins were heavily impacted by foreign exchange which was about a 400 basis point headwind versus last year excluding foreign exchange impacts our automotive margins would have been up year over year despite lower volumes sequentially segment margins improved 270 basis points as we continue to work on both short and long term margin improvement business opportunities heavily focused on the sensor business within the sensor business we followed fourth quarter cost reduction with additional action during the first quarter we also announced the closure of one of our automotive sensor manufacturing plants in europe a more streamlined manufacturing footprint is one of the many actions we re taking to drive margin expansion across our auto sensor business our industrial segment continued to have strong sales progression driving 4 organic growth for the quarter margins were down compared to last year as we had a onetime benefit with the closure of the custom business last year and as the business has grown across new products and geographies our sales mix can vary impacting margins in the quarter the focused portfolio we now have within our industrial segment is aligned with our profitability expectations and continues to show a strong organic growth trajectory looking at cash flow we generated 31 million in operating cash flow for the quarter and 17 million in free cash flow both were lower last year mainly due to lower sales volume impacting earnings along with higher restructuring and interest payments and timing of supplier payments we continued to drive our capital allocation strategy executing on several areas this quarter during the first quarter we repatriated nearly 100 million of cash ending the quarter with over 25 of our cash in the united states we expect to repatriate at least another 100 million during the remainder of the year which gives us ongoing flexibility to execute on our growth strategy our debt levels were unchanged during the quarter with our adjusted growth leverage ending at 1 7x on a total debt to adjusted ebitda basis and under 1 0x on a net basis during the first quarter we repurchased approximately 80 000 shares at an average price of approximately 170 per share since last october we repurchased a total of 472 000 shares at about 173 per share our share buyback authorization expired on april 30 and our board approved a new authorization of 1 million shares through april 30 2020 similar to prior years we ve maintained a consistent share buyback philosophy over the past several years entering the market when we feel our valuation is at a low point this philosophy has served our shareholders well ensuring we optimize returns on our buybacks overall the first quarter played out as we expected reflecting the slower growth market environment our teams remained focus on what we can control delivering value to our shareholders through identifying new growth opportunities while managing costs in a dynamic market environment and with that i ll turn it back over to dave for more color on business performance and market trends dave heinzmann lfus thanks meenal i ll start with our electronics product segment in the first quarter reported sales of 265 million were up slightly with organic sales down 4 while we saw softness across some of our electronics end markets we had success and growth opportunities across appliances and automotive electronics despite a significant decline in global auto production we continue to see channel inventory corrections in response to lower growth rate and excess inventory at end customers our electronics book to bill exited the first quarter was nearing 1 0 an improvement over where we were what we were seeing over 3 months ago we continue to closely monitor distributor point of sales data and inventory levels broad line distributor book to bill for our products was also around 1 0 during the quarter we saw stable demand for our power semiconductor products which have less automotive and distribution exposure however the protection side of the semiconductor business similar to our passives business is more reliant on the distribution channels and was impacted by excess inventory while our channel partners have reduced absolute inventory levels in our product slower end market demand resulted in a static level of weeks of inventory in the channel as we exited the first quarter channel inventories across most of our electronics products remained at the upper end of our normal range which is typically 11 to 14 weeks as a result we expect continued softness with ongoing distributor inventory destocking consistent with our comments in january our long term relationships with our channel partners are a significant factor contributing to our success across our electronics products segment as about 75 of sales in this segment are fulfilled through our distribution partners these relationships jointly drive demand creation end customer partnerships and ultimately collectively drive profitable growth however when the market growth patterns change it does expose us to greater sales volatility historically over 3 to 4 quarters sales can be impacted due to both inventory stocking trends as well as end customer demand we are seeing the impact of this volatility within our electronics products segment we continue to make good progress on our ixys integration effort in 2018 we were focused on expanding our customer relationships and meeting elevated demand requirements resulting in 15 revenue growth at the same time we aligned our resources to begin driving to our 30 million run rate synergy target we made significant progress exceeding our year 1 goal and achieved 40 of the target we are continuing that momentum in 2019 and expect to realize 90 of our target by the end of this year as we look beyond 2019 we expect to meaningfully exceed our 30 million savings target as we continue to identify opportunities to streamline our collective business operations as part of these synergy efforts we completed another round of portfolio rationalization actions during april we sold an rf product line from the ixys portfolio that doesn t align with our long term growth strategy the transaction will not have a material impact on our sales but does emphasize our ongoing focus on synergy realization and optimizing our business also on the ixys front there are several manufacturing rationalization actions we intend to take in a phased approach these long term actions will help us better leverage resources and systems while enhancing capabilities to better serve our customers they are also a key part of exceeding our 30 million synergy target over the next few years we have announced a new facility our third plant at our philippines site our intent is to consolidate most of our european semiconductor assembly and test operations over the next 2 to 3 years in this new plant our ongoing progress integrating the ixys business is on track with our expectations and continues to add value for our customers and shareholders turning to the end markets we serve we continue to see strong design wins in electronification and sophistication continues its momentum and our customers as our customers develop safer greener and more connected products we secured wins for a wide range of applications including telecom for 5g and data centers appliances continue to be a strong end market for us in circuit protection and especially electronic sensor products where you re seeing several quarters of double digit growth we captured design wins for a variety of home automation products and white goods automotive electronics is another good end market where we have made sustained progress we won business for our rearview mirror camera system as well as battery management systems as a wrap up as i wrap up the electronics products segment our competitive advantage is centered around our leadership in circuit protection and growing platforms in power control and sensing technologies the strength of our brand is further reinforced by more than 100 000 end customers we serve each quarter next i will cover our automotive products segment in the first quarter sales of 113 million were down 10 as reported and down 7 organically compared to a car build decline of about the same magnitude we continue to see global content increases for our automotive circuit protection products while our results outpace the production declines in north america and europe in asia in particular in china revenue declines were driven by excess inventory in the channel compared to our protection business our automotive sensor portfolio is more program based independent on tier 1 sell through and end customer take rates it is therefore subject to greater volatility our results in the first quarter reflect this dynamic where we saw customer delays for several major sensor projects and a key tier 1 customer losing a significant program with an oem similar to our protection business in sensors we also saw excess inventory buildup in china looking ahead for automotive product segment we expect continued car build softness during the second quarter volatility in demand persists due to global trade and slower economic conditions in china and europe beyond the near term noise we continue to see meaningful content opportunities across the transportation end markets we serve these are driven by the long term trends of increasing electrification with the transition to hybrids and evs even greater sophistication in the electrical architecture of today s vehicles and continuous advancements in vehicle electronification we continue to prioritize margin improvement across our automotive products segment with a particular focus on the sensor business as meenal noted earlier foreign exchange across this segment was a significant headwind for us slowing our path to improvement this quarter but focusing on what we can control we took further cost reduction actions in the sensor business in this quarter along with the announcement of the closure of one of our european automotive sensor manufacturing sites also as we mentioned previously we are launching several new products and technologies across our sensor business while we re making progress these launches continue to create a near term drag on profitability beyond these short and long term cost reduction actions we are looking broadly at additional profitability improvements across the auto and sensor portfolio on the new business front we continue to gain new design wins across transportation end market as manufacturers remain focused on safer greener and more connected vehicles in the first quarter we secured global design wins in several applications across a spectrum of vehicle types from conventional to hybrid to full ev for example we won new business on emission modules for standardized c engines and ev on vehicle chargers we saw significant design wins for engine cooling and emergency call or e call applications and captured design wins across solar position and temperature sensing applications we also secured another design win in the material handling market one of the strategic growth areas for our commercial vehicle business this win was for a power distribution model module with a large european forklift manufacturer as we wrap up the automotive products segment i wanted to make mention of some well deserved industry recognition for our teams received this quarter our kaunas lithuania and matamoros mexico locations were awarded the prestigious 2018 supplier quality excellence award from general motors this award acknowledges a supplier to meet various stringent quality criteria and is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our global teams to deliver the highest level of quality and service for our customers we re proud of this recognition and look forward to continuing to partner with all our customers around the world finally we will cover our industrial products segment our first quarter sales of 27 million were down 2 due to the exit of a custom business in the third quarter of 2018 organic revenue for the quarter was up 4 we saw stable demand in north america and based on our efforts to expand our presence in other regions we achieved solid growth in asia and europe during the quarter we secured several important design wins with key oems in korea and spain we won business for energy storage application and in japan for a solar power conversion application we also made progress with wins for led lighting and factory automation applications looking ahead given our abundant opportunity pipeline and the consistent customer pool we are seeing our industrial products segment remains poised to outpace industry growth across the end markets we serve we are well positioned to secure business within high growth applications such as alternative energy industrial power conversion mining oil and gas and hvac market forecasts indicate these areas should continue to perform well and we expect to participate in this growth with that i ll call turn the call over to meenal to talk about guidance meenal anil sethna cfo thanks dave onto guidance now as we discussed in january we expected the first half of 2019 was going to be a challenge due to a variety of market factors but we expected to see improving conditions largely in the second half of the year as dave noted the market trends in content opportunities we continue to see aligned to this view with this backdrop we anticipate sales for the second quarter of 2019 of 409 million to 421 million the midpoint of the guidance reflects a 10 decline in reported sales and a 7 organic sales decline versus last year we estimate currency to be about a 2 headwind to sales growth for the quarter we expect second quarter adjusted diluted eps to be in the range of 2 to 2 14 our adjusted eps guidance assumes an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18 to 19 for the quarter our adjusted eps guidance includes an estimated 0 25 decline from last year due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and mark to market comparisons as well as timing of stock compensation expense sequentially sales growth is projected to be up 2 with adjusted eps growth projected to be 6 at the midpoint of our guidance highlighting the cost improvement efforts that we re driving we are estimating 25 million share 25 million diluted shares for the second quarter which incorporates the shares bought back to date i ll also provide a few additional financial model updates for the full year consistent with the recent trends currencies continue to be a headwind based on current foreign exchange rates for the full year we expect to see about a 1 sales decline from foreign exchange and about 0 50 in adjusted eps decline versus last year due to currency at current interest rates we are estimating interest expense for the year in the range of 22 million to 23 million we expect amortization expense of approximately 40 million for the year we re maintaining our full year 2019 tax rate range in the 18 to 20 range but expect the rate to vary across quarters due to the timing of certain discrete tax items our full year estimate for capital expenditures remains 90 million to 95 million we expect to invest for long term organic growth opportunities as well as the ixys footprint and integration work which is in full swing this year and with that i ll turn it over to dave for some final comments david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director thanks meenal in conclusion you can see by our actions that we remain focused on operational excellence and managing our costs to align to business conditions over the years we have been a proven source of growth and value creation our business fundamentals remain strong and we are well positioned to benefit from the content opportunities driven by the global megatrends of safety energy efficiency and increasing connectivity we will continue to differentiate our company by the consistency reliability and performance we deliver with our circuit protection power control and sensing products in the electronics industrial and transportation end markets we serve i will now turn the call back to the operator for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from shawn harrison with longbow research please proceed shawn matthew harrison longbow research llc analyst good morning the inventory correction that you re seeing in the electronics business based upon the pos you re seeing from distribution now through april do you think you ll be freeing clear that inventory overhang as you move into the second half of the year and get more toward a typical organic growth rate david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director shawn as we discussed in the prepared remarks we did see absolute inventory dollars reduced in the channels with our distribution partners but with sell through the weeks of inventory really didn t move down very much so there s certainly more work to be done in driving that out of the channel but clearly that s impacting and reflected in our guidance in the second quarter our general view is there s a likelihood it leads into the third quarter but certainly begins to improve in the back half of the year pure shawn matthew harrison longbow research llc analyst okay great and then as a follow up is there a way to quantify the actions the non ixys actions you ve taken to improve profitability either be it in the sensors business or other businesses and when you would expect to see the full run rate of those potential profit improvement actions meenal anil sethna cfo yes so shawn as i mentioned also in the prepared remarks we started in the fourth quarter into the first quarter with cost reductions and then also we just recently announced the plant closure i mentioned those take a little bit of time to start to get into the run rate these closures typically take 6 to 9 months to complete by the time you get everything out so i would say you re going to see progressive sequential improvement in the margins that s what we re expecting from the cost actions i think the pieces that are a little bit difficult to predict right now are things like foreign exchange is an example which had a pretty significant headwind for us but we would expect progressive sequential improvement from all the cost actions that we re doing operator and our next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer please proceed christopher glavin oppenheimer analyst thanks hey good morning on the ixys integration comments that process including some footprint stuff in full swing just wondering if we should be thinking about impacts on the profitability of ixys even on an adjusted basis i know you exclude restructuring costs that are made but typically there is redundancies and such david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director well certainly we expect the profitability of the ixys business that we acquired to continue to gradually improve profitability as we put these actions in place as we ve talked about we ve taken some steps on taking out some product lines that really didn t drive margin profiles that we felt were appropriate and didn t fit our strategy and these cost reduction moves also longer term on footprint rationalization will take time to get in place as we talked about we literarily announced recently we re starting construction of a new plant in the philippines that s going to take us 2 to 3 years to get the plant completed the transfer is completed customer approvals and things like that but we certainly believe year to year we will continue to see gains and profitability of the ixys business christopher glavin oppenheimer analyst okay and on the 0 50 of eps impact from fx for the year can you review the mechanics on transactional exposure there overall and then where it hits particularly it sounds like auto meenal anil sethna cfo yes so if i step back bigger picture from the business that we have and where we do business in general we have a long position when it comes to the euro so the weaker euro has hurt us and we have short positions in largely in the countries where we ve got larger manufacturing sites so in places like china where the stronger rmb does hurt us the philippines and mexico so i think with that backdrop with the direction where currencies have moved and moving around a little bit it s the combination of really i d say those 4 currencies that are really causing and i d say the bulk of that being from that euro and the rmb that are really causing that year over year decline and specifically on your question on auto chris when we take a look at our broader i ll call it the sales and the manufacturing footprint auto is probably the most dispersed in terms of sales around the world in multiple currencies and really manufacturing and locations around the world across the entire segment so that s why it tends to get hurt the most from a currency perspective operator and our next question comes from david leiker with baird please proceed david liker baird analyst hi good morning i guess 2 things i d like to dig to they re kind of related i mean if you look at the timing of the stock comp it s headwind here in q2 i mean by definition i think that implies there was a tailwind at some point last year can you help clarify that and as you look at how the q1 and q2 are progressing and if you step back 3 or 4 months can you give us some sense i know you don t give full year guidance but some sense of what that full year looks like obviously currency and production are headwinds but what about the balance of that relative to what you are expecting at the start of the year meenal anil sethna cfo yes so let me take the stock comp piece first so really the stock comp is really a timing issue and if i put it simply for us grants occur in the second quarter of the year and we like many companies have provisions around retirement and age of service and if individuals meet those provisions you ve got we accelerate vesting and so you take expense immediately in the quarter so rather than radically having that expensive spread over multiple years it gets it hits all in one quarter and so that s really that ends up being the timing issue i d say twofold one being second quarter for us tends to have the highest stock compensation expense because of that and as we have some bigger vests that are going on it even front loads expense versus the multiple years of vesting that you have david liker baird analyst but the timing of that is similar to what it would have been in past years is that right meenal anil sethna cfo the timing is similar to past years but we happen to have just some higher we happen to have just with the population that we have we just happen to have more people that fall into that and with some higher dollar amounts year over year david liker baird analyst okay and then if we leave currency and leave the build rates on the side if you look at the rest of the business how would you characterize that that s performing relative to where you expected at the beginning of the year david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes i think i ll take that david i think in general the year is kind of shaping up as we expected going directly into the year we certainly knew that the first half of the year with excess inventories and a bit of a correction in the electronics side of the business was going to be a challenge that we re seeing that maybe it ll take up a little longer than we had hoped to kind of bleed through that maybe again as i mentioned earlier little bit in the third quarter from the automotive standpoint we going into the year had a more pessimistic view on what car build was going to look like in the full year of 2019 than maybe what the agencies were putting out probably pretty consistent though was i think what david your and baird s view is on what car build is so yes kind of shaping out as we expected i do think the amounts of excess inventory in the channels in automotive which normally has not been or has not historically been so much of a headwind in china because of our structure being a little different and a number of small tier 1s and small oems that we serve a lot of that gets served through distribution channels and so there was more excess inventory in the channel in automotive than we would typically have seen and that s probably a bit of a negative surprise for us but we ll work our way through that as car builds pick up in asia operator and our next question comes from matt sheerin with stifel please proceed matt sheerin analyst good morning matt stock comp and the year over year headwinds that 0 25 year over year headwind on eps you talked about stock comp and mark to market and fx could you break that down for us and also kind of elaborate on what that mark to market impact was and what was that meenal anil sethna cfo yes so let me start with your second question so we talked about in various calls that with the accounting rules changed around minority investments that you had and that changed in the beginning of 2018 so you re required the mark to market minority investments that you have and that mark to market runs through that p l so we have a few investments that we ve impact every quarter sometimes end up being materials last year for us we had some positive income that came through and you know we don t forecast that so that ends up being the issue and that s about a 0 05 impact on a year over year basis the stock comp incremental piece on a year over year basis is about 0 09 and then the rest is foreign exchange matt sheerin analyst okay great that s helpful and then back on to the electronics business and the headwinds that you re seeing and the correction one thing i think you did talk about that last quarter was the fact that the pricing has been stable if not firm or up in some cases last year and the thought from other suppliers industry leaders is that volumes come back we re going to be see return to normal more pricing and some pricing pressure are you starting to see that as volumes come back and what s your take on the pricing environment as we go through the year david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director good question matt and yes we talked about last year we probably have more about favorable pricing conditions than we would in a normal year with a strong kind of buildup that was going on and the focus on making sure they had product so we do see that beginning to move back closer on its way toward normal it s not back yet at a stage where we see pricing at kind of our average level particularly in electronics so it s still favorable compared to history but it s becoming unfavorable compared to last year so we our expectation is that kind of work its way back to normal levels over the course of the next maybe 3 or 4 quarters meenal a sethna chief financial officer executive vice president thank you matt operator operator instructions our next question comes from steven fox of cross research please proceed steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst first question was the operating leverage you called out in your for the current quarter the 6 increase in profits versus 2 in sales what are the main drivers quarter over quarter in that leverage and then i have a follow up meenal a sethna chief financial officer executive vice president sure so the 2 and the 6 that i called out was really for the second quarter the 2 growth steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst yes yes that s what i was talking about meenal anil sethna cfo sure so the so when i talked about earlier with some of the questions the stock compensation piece is actually from a timing perspective a sequential perspective that s actually a negative for us and then offsetting that there were some of the operational improvements we ve been talking about it s the continued progression we see in the ixys synergies that are coming through the additional volume that we have the sales volume that helped us from a margin and leverage drop through as well and then overall we ve been talking about the past couple of quarters we re really containing costs in terms of not just variable costs but other discretionary spend et cetera and you re seeing some of the benefits of that steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst great that s helpful and then i have a follow up if it s ok david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director sure steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst in terms of closing the sensor plant i guess i was trying to understand the thought process involved there whether how reactionary it was or strategic and given sort of the uncertain hopefully improving markets and some of the product pruning you seem to have on your operating calendar to do could you pull some of that in or push some of that out are you going to move that around depending on market conditions david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes so in general what s driven us to make the decision to do a plant consolidation and shut down a plant we have a small relatively small sensor manufacturing plant in italy we have a larger factory in lithuania and we also do a lot of sensor manufacturing in mexico so we made the decision to simplifying the footprint for the long term would give us a better and a lower fixed overhead cost structure so we made that decision really for the long term strategy of the business pulling that in pushing that out it s really not related to particular cycles or things like that because as you know in the automotive world when you re making transfers and changes just like that you got to work very closely with customers and get qualifications and go through that process so that really dictates the timing of when you can complete those things other actions that we re looking at in the automotive sensor business clearly in the automotive world you don t move very rapidly with customers without creating problems for customers so we will continue to look at those things and make decisions and take actions as quickly as possible but with respect to what our customers needs and make sure we re supporting our customers as we implement those changes meenal anil sethna cfo thank you steven operator and our next question comes from george godfrey with cl king associates george james godfrey cl king associates analyst it s george i believe you said the organic growth on a sequential basis for q2 about 2 is that right meenal anil sethna cfo yes correct george james godfrey cl king associates analyst okay so if i just annualize that 8 there s no reason to think of 5 to 7 target is off the table is that right meenal a sethna chief financial officer executive vice president i would say we are we re pleased with the fact that we ve been showing sequential growth the past couple of quarters but i would say with a lot of the market dynamics that we ve talked about on the electronics side with the excess inventory sitting in the channel we re still working through that and the other backdrop being automotive the first half being so far down on car builds i think you d be a bit optimistic to assume an 8 growth for the year even on a sequential basis but i think we ve got to see how things really play out the next couple of quarters george james godfrey cl king associates analyst no i was thinking on the 3 year targets that you laid out before the 5 to 7 on i realize any given year could be up or down but those are still on the table correct meenal anil sethna cfo yes i what i look back at is the 5 to 7 is still absolutely there we stand by the 5 to 7 and don t really have any change to that if i take a look at the past couple of years we ve been growing 7 and 8 organically average out to about 8 the past 2 years it s not going to be that when we look at a year over year growth this year but we still feel very good about the long term the 5 year view on our 5 to 7 target that we ve set out to achieve operator and our next question comes from gary prestopino with barrington research please proceed meenal anil sethna cfo good morning gary gary preston pino analyst good when you guys when you reported q4 numbers you were talking about a decline in auto build of 2 to 4 for this year given what s happened in q1 with the auto build has that changed at all in your outlook david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes i think our outlook of full year build remains pretty consistent in that but we do expect it to be down low single digits for the year that s kind of our view and there are a lot of thoughts out there from all the different companies as well as the agencies that produce those forecasts the comps on car build get easier in the back end of the year so it ll certainly show an improvement year over year in the back end of the year compared to last year but i think our view is still that we ll ultimately end up car build down a couple of percentage points gary preston pino analyst okay and then so then that would based on what happened in q1 it would imply that it s got to get better as we go through the year so in terms of what you are seeing there is it going to be basically more a north american based for your business european based china based or is it just the content growth all across the board david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes first of all we certainly continue to see content growth beyond car build globally so that continues to be a good story for us and so we re comfortable with that to kind of continuing storyline from a car build and how things are going to improve going into the back end of the year i would say north america has been kind of relatively stable and we ll see it bounce around stable for our most of the year we don t see that changing dramatically europe we see softening in the second quarter compared to last year clearly but if you remember last year there was kind of a buildout to wltp and then a decline in the back end of the year the big swing will be whether china car build particularly china car build picks up in q3 or ultimately into q4 where they re expecting strong performance there so a lot of it is really dependent on i would say asia being the big swinger operator and we have a follow up from david leiker with baird david liker baird analyst just i guess a couple of other things here if we look at ixys you talked about winning a contract for an onboard charger is that contract win a function of ixys and being able to cross sell that product or something that has been developed in contract 1 organically with what was within littelfuse before david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes actually that specific win we were talking about is actually in our circuit protection business it wasn t with the power semiconductor business but with that said we are seeing good design wins and good activity particularly in asia with ixys power semiconductors being designed into off board charging systems not on board yet we talked about this before ixys really has not had a lot of business in the on vehicle side of the automotive and we re working through readiness on that and we see that long term on the roadmap for us for sure but in the near term the opportunity in the power semi side on the evs is really in the infrastructure side david liker baird analyst okay and then just one other item back on the inventory channel side of the equation particularly on the automotive side i guess more than others we ve heard comments from some other suppliers similar type of environment that you re in that have been talking about those inventories looking closer to more normal inventory levels to what you seem to be suggesting is there any do you have any thoughts on what you might be seeing that s different than what some others might be seeing david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes i can t speak for the exact supply chain that others are seeing in north america and europe for us we have a relatively short supply chain between us and ultimately oem we ship directly to the tier 1s the tier 1s then carry their kind of normal inventory levels into the oems but that operates a bit differently for us in china with several smaller tier 1s in the electrical infrastructure side and a number of oems being served much of that for us we re serving through a distribution channel so there s one more step in the supply chain if you will in china that we don t see in the rest of the world and with that it adds the typical inefficiency of another step in the supply chain and with a lot of strong growth in car build in china for so long i think they were carrying pretty heavy inventory levels to make sure that they could respond to fluctuations in demand from the oems and as car builds came down they ended up having came down very meaningfully particularly with the chinese national oems the amount of inventory they were carrying in the channel is higher and they re bleeding that down so i think i can t speak for others that s a unique thing for us in china specifically that drives the problem operator and our next question is from steven fox with cross research please proceed steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst sorry for the follow up i just want to make sure i was clear on one part of my question dave when you look at product pruning going on is that something that you can sort of manage relative to markets or is that sort of fix given where you are with different end of life commitments david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes so specific i think we re talking about automotive sensors on that in the automotive world when we make that decision we want to work our way may be out of a particular area particular application the reality is that does take time because we re not with our ongoing relationships with the automotive customers we re not interested in putting them in a difficult position so we ll communicate with them and work it off over the course of a couple of years to kind of work through those sorts of things in the automotive world whereas in other spaces where we ve done some product pruning in and around the ixys business most of those cases we re able to take faster actions to kind of work our way through that in a year or less than a year operator and our next question is from david sic george james godfrey with cl king associates please proceed george james godfrey cl king associates analyst thank you for taking the fall dave you are quite accurate in providing a little color on what you thought the automotive market would look like this year ahead of time do you have any just curious on your experience any intuitions on what it might look like next year at this point or do you need to be closer to the end of the current year david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director what i i think we would have to be able to closer at the end of the year because it is so much driven by kind of regional economies and things like that it s a little hard for me to predict that what i will say is kind of take us back to comments we ve made before which was we build our strategy over the long term we believe global car build grows at about global gdp which is about 2 on a year over year basis by the way if you look back from 2016 which was about a 5 car build growth and in 2017 at a 2 and you kind of look over the period of time it s kind of end up being about 2 so i don t have any particular insight on what 2020 looks like other than our long term plan continues to build around that 2 or so trisha lee tuntland head of ir thank you for joining us on today s call and your interest in littelfuse we look forward to talking with you again soon have a great day duration 50 minutes call participants trisha lee tuntland head of ir

foe earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 ferro foe q1 2019 earnings call 8 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning thank you for joining the ferro corporation 2019 first quarter earnings conference call an archived replay of this teleconference will be available through the investor information section at ferro com later today and will be available for approximately seven days i would now like to turn the call over to mr kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate communications kevin grant thank you and good morning everyone welcome to ferro s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call this morning we ll be reviewing ferro s financial results for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 i m pleased today to be joined today by peter thomas our chairman president and ceo and ben schlater group vice president and chief financial officer the earnings release and conference call presentation deck are available in the investors section of our website i d like to remind everyone that some of the comments we are making today are forward looking statements and are based on our view of conditions and circumstances as we see them today however those views may change as conditions and circumstances change please refer to the forward looking statement disclosure in the earnings release and the earnings presentation 10 stocks we like better than ferro when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and ferro wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 1 2019 also today s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis descriptions of these non gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release and presentation deck we encourage you to view that information in conjunction with today s discussion it s now my pleasure to pass the call over to peter peter thomas good morning everyone thank you for joining us today the first quarter proved to be challenging and tested our business as demand softened fortunately we have a level of resiliency relative to any one market because of our diversified customer base and an orientation to enable this but enables us to adapt quickly to market conditions that s not to say that we are satisfied with the quarter s results we are not but we are focused on a longer view in making the right decisions to achieve sustainable growth like many of the companies in our space we experience softer demand during the first quarter in some of the markets in which we participate in certain of the higher end and niche markets that we moved into in recent years the order patterns and inventory destocking are different from what we see at the mid level of the markets particularly in tile this contributed to weaker demand in both the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 impacting margins as well as sales customers at the high end of the tile market that were stocking about six months of inventory shifted several months ago to maintaining three to four months of inventory we anticipated that these customers would build back to a six month inventory level in the first quarter but they have not yet done so and it seems that some are still ordering just in time levels absorption also played a role in the first quarter decline in earnings the destocking we discussed contributed to lower volumes at some of our larger facilities eroding profitability we expect to offset these absorption headwinds in the second half of 2019 with increased volume throughput and benefits from our optimization initiatives i ll comment further on the remainder of the year later in my prepared remarks we learned from this experience and we will use the knowledge we gained about this market dynamic as we go forward from challenging circumstances we intend to make ourselves better economic conditions especially in europe and china also affected our business in the first quarter because a significant portion of ferro s revenue comes from europe we felt the negative impact much less of our revenue comes from china but we still felt the effects of relative weaker demand there i don t know that we have a clear line of sight to recovery from the slowdown in europe but it s worth noting that government stimulus in china may improve conditions there and this may in turn positively affect europe closer to home weather was a factor in the united states construction markets which impacted building projects and reduced demand from customers served by our color solutions pigments business in addition headwinds from foreign exchange rates negatively impacted sales by about 21 million so all in all not a good quarter after strong performances in 2017 and 2018 but there were positives that demonstrate the flexibility of our business model and reinforce what we said about outperforming the markets where we participate we believe we can outperform the markets because of the value we bring to our customers and our ability to increase productivity through optimization initiatives examples of outperformance include automotive industrial and surface technology sub segments all of which we expect will outperform their markets for the year we remain enthusiastic about ferro s position in relation to certain mega trends within society that should continue to create opportunities for growth in these businesses for example we see exciting opportunities for our surface technologies business in connection with the move to 5g technology and we see opportunities for our electronics business in north america as more and more smart technology is added to automobiles we will continue to manage through this time of global macro economic uncertainty with judicious investment managing leverage and continuing to execute innovation and optimization initiatives regarding optimization we review optimization as a means to increase productivity and efficiency and become a better more profitable company we ve built a culture committed to improvement involving and getting better all the time by innovating growing updating and optimizing the business never being complacent optimization becomes even more crucial when managing through macroeconomic weaknesses as previously discussed we have implemented a number of optimization initiatives including consolidating manufacturing sites logistical facilities and r d labs the largest of these the americas manufacturing optimization initiative which we have discussed previously will begin contributing to adjusted ebitda this year we have a number of other optimization initiatives under way or planned as well with opportunities throughout the company our optimization efforts include optimizing our portfolio to continue to position ferro as an advanced technology partner enhance our market position after 20 acquisitions we are taking a good look at how best to optimize our portfolio going forward as appropriate we ll provide more details on this and other optimization efforts currently under way or completed in the future now let s turn to the performance of our three business segments in the first quarter in the presentation deck you can see summaries on slide 5 let begin with our performance coatings segment performance coatings volumes were up 2 8 while net sales on a constant currency basis were down 2 1 to 170 3 million adjusted gross profit decreased to 33 9 million from 41 1 million gross profit margin declined to 19 9 from 23 6 reflecting the shift in mix and volume due to the destocking and inventory re positioning i described earlier the dynamic that we experienced with the high end of the tile market has given us a greater appreciation for the destocking process in the high end segment of the market we have now gone through a cycle of strong growth as well as a period of weaker demand and a reset by our customers of inventory levels with the transition of our portfolio in recent years to sell more into the higher space we now better understand this dynamic and our customers purchasing habits now let s look at our performance colors and glass segment in the first quarter performance colors and glass volumes improved 9 4 with net sales on a constant currency basis up 5 3 organic sales improved 3 adjusted gross profit declined to 39 5 million from 41 2 million gross profit margin declined to 32 7 from sales increased by approximately 10 in our industrial business much of this increase was attributable to increased sales of our digital printing technology we believe we have a great opportunity with this technology to transition to flat glass market to digital printing our electronic materials business grew approximately 13 in the quarter this was driven by sales of multi layered film paste and tapes for sensors dielectrics and capacitors which are used in heavy duty applications such as automotive airspace and military applications after a strong year of market growth in 2018 sales in our automotive business were down low mid single digits we continue to see pressure in north america which accounted for the majority of the decline in our automotives sales europe was up low single digits but offset by decline in asia pacific this performance was not a surprise as we expected 2019 to be weaker and we expect continued weakness in our automotive business throughout the course of the year decoration was down low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to strong demand for off cycle container glass in the prior year now turning to the color solutions segment in the first quarter color solutions net sales on a constant currency basis were flat while volumes were down 4 2 adjusted gross profit came in at 29 3 million as compared to 31 6 million in the prior year gross profit margin declined to 30 5 from 32 8 first quarter sales of our pigments were affected by softer demand in the construction and building market due to weather in the united states as well as a shift in the automotive market away from ultramarine blues the slower start of the year in our pigments business was offset by a stronger demand for our surface technology products now let s talk a little bit about what lies ahead many companies in our space expect the second quarter to be similar to the first relatively weak ferro s second quarters typically are strongest so we are optimistic about the second quarter ramping up from the first we perceive there to be a general expectation in the markets we serve that the second half of 2019 will be better than the first half we generally share those sentiments based on indicators that we see in our business although i will not say that we have clear visibility into remainder of the year uncertainly around trade talks brexit and the auto markets in asia cloud the horizon looking still further ahead to 2020 although market conditions have softened since 2017 when we introduced our 2020 goals we still have a pathway and we are focusing our teams on achieving those goals i ll now turn the call over to ben for his comments ben schlater thank you peter and good morning everyone i d like to start out this morning discussing our consolidated finance results for the first quarter 2019 please note that the non gaap numbers i refer to are on an adjusted basis and growth rates mentioned are on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2018 the financial highlights and results can be reviewed on slide 3 and 4 in the presentation accompanying today s call which you can find on ferro com in the investor section turing to slide 4 in the first quarter we grew net sales 0 7 to 387 5 million while adjusted gross profit declined 9 6 to 102 9 million adjusted sg a expense was 69 3 million or 17 9 of net sales and adjusted ebitda declined to 47 9 million or 12 4 of net sales and adjusted eps declined to 0 22 for the first quarter there were a few non gaap adjustments primarily related to our corporate development acquisition and optimization activities first in cost of sales we have adjustments of approximately 1 million primarily due to costs related to optimization initiatives in sg a we have one time adjustments of 2 8 million in the quarter consisting of legal professional and other expenses related to certain corporate development activities and certain optimization initiatives including the manufacturing optimization we announced earlier this year turning to restructuring and impairment there was an adjustment of approximately 2 1 million in the first quarter related to actions to achieve our ongoing optimization initiatives and acquisition synergies finally in the quarter under other income and expense we had an adjustment of about 100 000 related primarily to optimization costs now moving to sg a in the first quarter adjusted sg a expense was 69 3 million or 17 9 of net sales compared with 66 1 million or 17 2 of net sales in the prior year quarter as stated on a constant currency basis newly acquired businesses accounted for the majority of the increase while base company sg a was nearly flat year over year this brings me to adjusted free cash flow adjusted free cash flow was in line with our expectations with the use of 45 3 million in the first quarter compared to 42 4 million use in the prior year we have reconfirmed our prior full year free cash flow conversion guidance of 45 to 50 we define adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations as gaap net cash provided by operating activity less capex then we add back cash used for our most recently announced manufacturing optimization acquisition related items and restructuring activity the most meaningful components for the quarter are as follows starting with gaap net income of 13 9 million we add 15 1 million of depreciation and amortization less 100 million for working capital plus 4 million of a change in other balance sheet items and less 0 5 million of other non cash p l items to arrive at cash used from operating activities of 67 5 million on a gaap basis then we subtract 23 3 million of capital expenditures and add cash received on other receivables of 20 2 million to arrive at 70 7 million of free cash flow use in the first quarter our practice has been to adjust this number for cash flow related to our strategic activities these include one cash related to our recently announced manufacturing optimization two m a related cash flow and three cash flow from restructuring programs a quantification of those three adjustments for the year are as follows 21 2 million for optimization projects 2 3 million related to m a and 1 9 million related to restructuring when we add these items back to our gaap number this brings adjusted free cash flow use for the year to 45 3 million compared to the prior year at 42 4 million the details of this calculation and the related reconciliation to gaap operating cash flow can be found on table 10 of the press release with respect to capital allocation in the first quarter we repurchased approximately 1 4 million shares of our stock for approximately 25 million at an average share price of 17 35 further we ended the first quarter with approximately 470 million of liquidity and leverage of approximately 3 4x consistent with our expectation from our year end call now i d like to spend some time reviewing our updated 2019 guidance as i mentioned earlier we are maintaining our adjusted free cash flow conversion between 45 and 50 however given the weakness that we saw in the first quarter and economic uncertainties we have updated our adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps guidance for the full year 2019 we expect adjusted ebitda in a range of 250 million to 260 million and adjusted eps in a range of 1 35 to 1 45 in summary we want to be clear that our guidance from our year end call is updated primarily to reflect a review of the end markets with the other components remaining approximately the same to add clarity to the guidance our ebitda bridge from 2018 to 2019 is as follows beginning with 2018 ebitda of 259 million we add the aggregate benefit from the americas manufacturing optimization net raw materials and acquisitions in a range of 22 million to 28 million for the year which is largely in line with the original guidance we gave last quarter then we subtract 8 million to 9 million for fx updated slightly to reflect the euro to u s dollar exchange rate at 1 12 finally we subtract 18 million to 20 million of organic headwinds which reflects the current market landscape and economic uncertainties that peter and i have highlighted today on the call i would also note that roughly two thirds of the organic headwind has been realized in the first quarter with the largest component related to destocking in our tile business and is already behind us we expect the balance to taper off throughout the remainder of the year to sum up those pieces to the 2018 adjusted ebitda of 259 million equals our guidance range of 250 million to 260 million for 2019 now turning to our walk for eps starting at our adjusted eps for 2018 of 1 50 we expect the aggregate benefit from the americas manufacturing optimization net raw materials and acquisitions to be within the range of 0 20 to 0 25 for the year again largely in line with the original guidance we gave last quarter then we subtract 0 05 to 0 06 for fx again updated slightly to reflect the u s to euro exchange rate at 1 12 and from there we subtract 0 14 to 0 18 of organic headwinds again roughly 2 3 of which has been realized in the first quarter finally we subtract 0 08 to 0 09 for the change in our tax rate and 0 01 to 0 02 for increased interest expense both of which are unchanged from our guidance last quarter the sum of those pieces to the 2018 adjusted eps of 1 50 equals our guidance range of 1 35 to 1 45 for 2019 to wrap up our comments on guidance i would like to give some context to how we view the remaining quarters of 2019 we expect the second quarter to meaningfully improve from the first quarter with adjusted eps in the range of 23 to 24 of our updated full year 2019 guidance of 1 35 to 1 45 further given the current macro themes and market conditions including the destocking in tile weaker euro zone and softer growth in china we expect the third quarter to be our strongest quarter followed by the fourth quarter as our guidance calls for a stronger economy in the second half of 2019 further if raw material prices remain at current levels we would expect sequential margin expansion in the second half of this year our 2019 guidance reflects foreign exchange spot rates as of 03 31 2019 including 1 12 for the euro against the dollar we have provided fx sensitivities in the guidance section of the earnings release in 2018 ferro generated approximately 40 to 45 of revenue in euros and approximately 25 to 30 in u s dollars we estimate that a 1 overall change in foreign currently exchange rates weighted for the countries where we do business would impact sales by approximately 10 million to 12 million and operating profit by 1 5 million to 1 7 million if you isolate for sensitivity on the euro a 1 change would impact operating profit by approximately 1 1 million to 1 3 million finally i would like to just build on what peter mentioned that we are constantly reviewing and taking steps to keep the company as nimble as possible to adapt to changes in the macro economic landscape focusing on what s in our control and maintaining our focus on cash and leverage with that i will turn the call over to kevin for q a kevin grant thanks ben with that operator let s open up the call for our first question questions answers operator thank you very much and we ll proceed with our first question on the line from rosemarie morbelli with g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli thank you and good morning everyone peter thomas good morning rosemarie ben schlater good morning rosemarie morbelli so looking at the results peter it seems as though performance coatings is obviously where you are having the most issues it is also your lowest margin business is there any consideration of selling it and immediately upgrading your portfolio and lowering your debt and potentially buying back stock is that something that management and the board are considering peter thomas as you know we pride ourselves on having a whole range of opportunities with this portfolio whether it s inorganic or organic and the optimization initiatives that we re going to further define here we are always in it in the interest of creating a better version of ourselves and we look at every opportunity to exercise that activity rosemarie morbelli ok i guess the answer is maybe yes so now looking at your optimization program i understand that it has been focused on north america and mostly the u s have you expanded those activities into europe peter thomas let me let me mention something to you because i like to always refer back to prior calls a year ago when we were further defining the optimization activity that we have announced which represented 30 million plus and we ve mentioned we would see around 8 million this year we would have the balance next year i also mentioned that during the exercise that we were building an optimization pipeline that probably would add another 12 million to 15 million of profitability so what i will share with you today is that in this environment which is very challenging certainly we work by the world you really can t worry about what you can t control but you certainly have control of how you manage through it and what i can tell you is that our organization as a whole has been phenomenal in embracing our strategy and the framework of the strategy and the fact that optimization is very important and that s why it s phase 4 the idea is 2020 targets we get there with a combination of organic inorganic and innovation as well as optimization activities we have a lot of levers to pull and i will tell you now that our expectation going into next year is that by the end of the year we ll have a run rate of about 15 million of new opportunities and profitability on top of what we ve already mentioned i will you re going to ask the question about where are we the answer is we did pull many of those levers some are staggering in some we re including in this guidance some of them were not because we will not do it until we have the right visibility because of the sensitivity of some of the projects and each quarter we ll fairly methodically like we always do we ll share those details but rest assured we are not sitting back we re not sitting here saying we just uncovered something we ve been planning this for a very very long time so it was easy for us to embrace pull the trigger and start executing some of those projects are already done and we have seen the value and we are very good as you know around managing the optimization side of this business so the news today is we re looking at a run rate of another 15 million next year rosemarie morbelli so that is in addition to the 30 million just clarifying here peter thomas yes and it s if you go back a year ago i did kind of mention that we had another 12 million to 15 million hiding in there that when the time was right that we would pull the trigger and we re doing that rosemarie morbelli ok and then if i may so peter thomas rosemarie morbelli i m sorry peter thomas well we ve done it already rosemarie morbelli ok so if i translate what ben talked about regarding the second quarter then your second quarter is going to be still substantially lower than last year second quarter at about 0 34 versus 0 44 are you expecting the second half while improving are you expecting it to be above 2018 ben schlater yes i think that that s implied in the guidance is that if you do the math on the second quarter we will see in the second half of the year a recovery from a year over year perspective rosemarie morbelli ok and then peter thomas yes what s rosemarie what s really important to note is that through all of this we re really back to what one would find define as being a normal order pattern for our business the second quarter i think we ve been pretty clear we feel really good about the sequencing of the second quarter being better than the first the third quarter being better than the second and i think there s a bit of an interesting dynamic that could be surfacing in the fourth quarter depending on we certainly know we re going against an ugly period last year and we know that the level of destocking where we sit today doesn t appear that s going to be as dramatic certainly because no one s really building their inventory levels up in an explosive way and yes i think the fourth quarter to be a very interesting quarter remember i think it was in maybe was in 17 we had a 9 year over year improvement in the fourth quarter from the prior year so the fourth quarter could be a pleasant surprise for us and i think if we keep doing what we re doing and i know we will we may have an interesting fourth quarter to show are you anticipating the this pattern the new pattern for the high end tiles to remain more or less the way they are meaning that they are not going back to building or six months say inventory supply but just sticking to the three to four months or even buying just some time is that in your projections that s a good point and i m glad you brought this up because we didn t get through the script and we re hoping it would come up it s a very interesting dynamic we ve discussed in the past the high end top producers typically would keep six months worth of inventory it swelled to seven to eight months during the hey hey of the first half of last year and then it precipitously dropped and in the middle of that activity as we were planning for the first quarter as you all know we did have we re so close to our customers and they were telling us that their objective was to build rebuild the inventories through the first quarter on a run rate basis that would be equivalent to what they defined as normalcy yet and maybe four to six months instead of something less in the meantime what s happened if you track the tile market right at the time where things were coming down in destocking there s been a very very substantial change in the demand in the type of tile that s moving forward and a lot of it has to deal with the larger sizes i mean i m not sure if everyone knows but part of the high end tile means that they have tiles that are three by five three by six five by six and some that could be as large as five by nines that would go into the industrial that s called commercial construction markets so while all this destocking took place coming out of this the demand for the type of tile moving into the new year has been more of the larger size which is more expensive and there s a lot of value to ferro in those tiles because we really are the market leader in supplying all the things that are necessary to give the design and the scale so rather than rebuilding their inventory with the old stuff they re orderly methodically ramping up to what one might define as even a repositioning of their inventory because they believe that the demand rather than coming from residential may be in the near term more construction oriented we do see our construction by the way in europe was up 8 so that s between glass and this larger tile exercise that we re speaking of so i think we had a dynamic here of the flush out but they re being orderly methodical around just in time with the old products but they were incrementally built through the course of the year with the bigger products and i think ben s point was very well taken more than two thirds of our issue organically is gone and what i can tell you we did a lot of work roughly the destocking cost this company maybe 26 million or so and 9 million to 10 million of gross profit so we have not built that adjustment into any of our forecast in fact if you separate the tile business from the rest of ferro what you re going to find through the course of the year where we stand today is we ll have upwards of 3 growth which is good in this environment and we have it made all the necessary assortments for us how we re kind of leaving that the way it s coming in we re listening to the customers they re being very orderly methodical and we don t want to make any decisions on what we think they re going to do or not do we want to leave it at this point where it is until we get into the second quarter because we ll have a better line of visibility with it operator thank you very much and we ll proceed with our next question on the line is from the line of mike sison with keybanc please go right ahead with your question mike sison hey guys peter thomas hey mike sison in terms of the in terms of the 18 million to 20 million sort of current landscape of demand what needs to happen to get that back over time and maybe walk us through the segments and what type of volume growth you d need to see ben schlater hey mike it s ben look i think it s a lot of what peter said so if you think about the impact from the destocking in the first quarter i think a piece of that is sort of the rebuilding of that inventory in the performance coatings piece of the business that would be my sense is as the single largest piece peter just reflected that we ve he said we have not built that into the guidance which is the case to the extent that that comes back that can come back in a quarter or two and to be a pretty significant lift to the numbers again we ve not reflected that in 2019 so that s performance coatings performance coatings in glass we re really not seeing anything from a from an overall weakness perspective i mean there s puts and takes autos a little slower electronics is much stronger and then with respect to color solutions we have seen slowness there in pigments primarily related to construction both in the u s and in europe and it looks like the second half of the year will be better from that perspective so i think that when you run rate the second half of if the second half of the year comes in as expected and you run rate that and we get an annualized impact from that you ll see a piece of that come back mike sison ok and then i think a lot of companies are looking for a second half improvement if you will some have given some thoughts in the event that there is no improvement so in the event there is no improvement in the second half how do you how does your outlook sort of change relative to where it is and where it is now peter thomas i think what we re showing mike reflects what we think is a reasonable case is building in that there if there s some softness is there i think what we re trying to do is be as predictable as we possibly can at this point we re giving you our best case we ve seen we don t see anything that is really chaotic or abstract to the end that you re referring to we have a lot of sensitivities model but i don t think it s really germane to even go there right now this is what we see we ve mentioned that the core business looks like 2 to 3 for the balance of the year the tile business we haven t built in that pickup in the type of inventory level we ve discussed i ve given you the dynamic that the destocking costs us 26 million in revenue about 9 million of gross profit so you can do some math around that if tile picks up how you might want to build that into your model if people get back to a position of normalcy with that inventory that s one way of looking at it and ben you may want to give the other dimension ben schlater yes i think mike the second half is i think there s two ways to look at it one is what s happening relative to the broader economy into what happened relative to the first half and i think that those are slightly different answers from the first half perspective the first quarter was down so significantly the second half is it sort of an even easier comp when compared sequentially and that s sort of what we ve reflected in the forecast i think if you look at the second half with respect to what we re expecting from an overall economic perspective it will be sort of a lift from the first half but that s mostly because of the destocking is behind us i would say we ve been relatively conservative from an overall organic growth perspective in the second half peter thomas yes mike let me add a couple more things i know where we are talking about the sensitivity about about what might win or use a downside but i think you heard what i mentioned that it was complemented with ben so let me let me give you another perspective because i think it s fair and balanced to discuss it one thing that s very important to know the rate of absorption increase will continue to drive our margin improvement particularly in the high end because you can see how it damaged us in the third fourth and first quarters if you will the second thing is the raw material tailwinds will continue regardless of what the sensitivity is about the economic environment one thing too we know that what we re seeing with our discussions with our customers around the world that positive trade agreements could spark higher auto and construction markets where we participate we re already around the world different areas i mentioned who else is telling you that construction is up 8 and in europe if you look at automotive applications i can share regional situations where we re growing double digits we know that the lower backs in china will favorably support our positions but more importantly it s what it does to europe rather than what it does to china indigenously because we know based on our contacts that the chinese government are certainly they re it s making efforts to boost sales around the automotive and coatings market so we have where we participate we re hearing that from our customers things will happen there and we feel very comfortable and again although europe is soft we will continue to outperform our european gdp driven by what we ve already mentioned with auto and construction because even in this environment as i mentioned automotive in europe is so sharp and so was construction and don t forget the driver iran our digital printing is gaining traction in the flat glass market so that s what helps spur in this soft environment that that technology is gaining traction and again at the end of the day what i ve just highlighted with you we have a focus on delivering those optimization programs that are 15 million on our run rate so i think that you have heard a set discussion for me on the onset around we believe we re giving you a fair represented case then highlighted and i just summarized on hey take a look at what isn t in here and try to use that information to decide how you want to build your own sensitivities we have done it on a low end and the high end and we feel what we ve done here is a fair representation of what we see it without any we re not economists we re not foreign exchange experts we re sitting here being as accurate and predictive as we possibly can with a lot of probability at this point mike sison great thank you ben schlater thanks mike operator thank you very much we ll get to our next question on the line with john mcnulty with bmo capital markets please go right ahead with your question john mcnulty yes good morning thanks for taking my question with regard to the fixed cost absorption that you had in the first quarter i guess one can you quantify what that was and then also do you feel like you re kind of running at more normal rates at this point so we don t see that as a drag going forward ben schlater yes sure hey john it s ben if you look at the year over year headwind from a gross profit perspective at the base company level between lower volumes and absorption almost three quarters of the overall headwind is from lower volumes and absorption so it s the vast vast majority of it we are and we would expect and it s included in the guidance absorption to return to more normal levels as we get into the end of the second quarter and so we do show that sequential improvement quarter over quarter between now and the end of the year john mcnulty got it ok and then with regard to the emanate pipeline out there i mean you were certainly more aggressive with buying back your stock in the quarter i guess how do you see the pipeline and how does that compare to your stock at these levels and the sense of urgency to be buying back stock and taking advantage of the lower price peter thomas yes so john it s peter first of all our m a pipeline is no different than what we ve discussed we continue to run parallel paths around the technology buys versus what we would find as a real company and also i ve mentioned in my prepared remarks that after 20 acquisitions we believe we ve stuffed our pipeline technology pipelines across all the businesses in a way that in addition to doing what we would normally do as we have been we re looking at things that could be maybe a bit more impactful to the business that would complement the more of an adjacent play at a bigger scale versus what we ve already created because remember where we are is that we now have about a 15 share in a 10 billion to 12 billion market versus 12 where we was a 4 billion market and we had a 50 we ve reached a point where we re managing the spread between organic growth and inorganic growth i mean as we were moving up in the early days we were more inorganic than organic then the vitality index pumped in and we re sitting at a nice balance we needed to get the organization to this point before we move forward because we re using a lot of math around us how do you what s spread between inorganic and organic do you run for a while in a way that lets your organization adjust to it and then now we re at a point where we want to do we believe we need to be a little more impactful on creating a better version of ferro it doesn t mean that we re going to stop it because right now the first half of this year we re working on and rightly so optimization activities making sure we feel good about what we re doing with our capital structure and of course you know we re trying to see if we can do something more meaningful and of course everything whether it s big or large takes the same amount of time but the orientation for the first half of this year is getting the infrastructure optimized looking get some bigger things while we still are moving along with a with the deals right now i can tell you we continue to always look at five in that zone that i ve mentioned that we could pull the trigger on but i can also tell you we re looking at three or four things that are more meaningful so yes we have we re expanding more ground here in terms are our ground of looking at expanding the business so we ll see what happens i mean we in the second half of the year i m sure that something will go on whatever that is and at that point we keep making the adjustments and how we want to manage the capital structure ben do you want to add anything to that ben schlater no no that s right john mcnulty ok great no that s helpful and then i guess just the last question you d mentioned in some of the prepared remarks around the opportunities in 5g can you help us to think about what or what the scale in terms of revenues might be over the next couple of years in those opportunities for you peter thomas yes i will tell you as much as i can because we re under a lot of secrecy agreements but as relates to 5g with us and you would i know you know the chemistry a lot of it has to deal around let s call them ceramic filters or telecommunication as well as strong vehicle to vehicle communications as well as linking with cellphones and also what can be done from the house to the car so there are a lot of novel things that are going on that i wish i could tell you work is very exciting but if you want to quantify something like that right now our pipeline for those activities would be over and above our vitality index you remember john i think when we were out with you we talked about developing another layer of an innovation vitality index if you will and that pipeline is growing nicely and 5g for us in that particular pipeline could be as much as 100 million and we ve only been working on a short period of time and again the margins are really rich there but they re fast paced and we re under secrecy agreement but we are we are gaining traction with that so we re very excited that s one of the things that i did want to mention with all of this destocking that s take place and people are focusing on their businesses we ve had more very intriguing r d conversations with our customers in terms of advancing their technologies as you know when you re in a rapid growth mode like we ve seen in 16 17 and 18 everybody s busy just getting the job done well some time has been freed up and i can tell you that our r d teams working with all of our top customers the discussions between the r d organizations have been more robust than i ve seen since 2015 so i think sometimes that s a feeder for the future and again we are of the the partner of choice with all the technology platforms we ve amassed and i did have a discussion about that trend in the last couple of calls i mean right now ferro s sitting on what we call as roughly 55 leading technology platforms that we ve acquired 34 on over the last 20 acquisitions so you can imagine with more free time like it s out there and all the intellectual property with all the market leading companies there are a lot of interesting things going on that going forward will certainly help our current vitality index as base organic growth but then help us build the innovation vitality index so we ll start reporting against i think we re going to feel comfortable we have a couple of things that could hit here but we re under secrecy agreement but as they commercialize we ll start discussing that that vitality index does that help you john mcnulty yes no that s very helpful thanks very much for the color operator thank you very much we ll get to our next question on the line from kevin hocevar from north coast research please go right ahead kevin hocevar hey good morning everybody peter thomas hey kevin kevin hocevar hey peter i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks some shift in auto in the auto market away from ultramarine blue could you elaborate on that a little bit and how much of the weakness in color solutions was driven by that versus how much i know you quantified that the tile destocking do you have a sense for how much the weather impacted the color solutions business peter thomas probably slight i would estimate two thirds of the color solutions piece was due to the slowdown with weather and maybe construction overall the ultramarine blue discussion has to deal with variations of grays and blacks and it seemed like the last six months there were certain ultramarine gray kind of automotive colors that weren t being produced as much however it s starting to come back so basically anything that was negative with color solutions from where we sit today are turning positive and that s why i mentioned if you take all of our businesses including color solutions you have blow them off for the last three quarters from an organic perspective other than tile we re looking at 2 to 3 organic growth where we sit right now so it s coming back i mean i think in that was a short term key and we wanted to mention that because it s funny that in times like these type of color of an automobile that a consumer wants could vary depending on moods we ve learned a lot around the high end of the markets with the colors and the other things that we do depending on economic situations will dictate the type of color orientation so i think that the mood is getting better when the mood is better the ultramarine blue grays and violets will well it will come back and we re starting to see that does that help kevin hocevar yes very helpful and on the pricing raw material front it looks like looking at the q raws still a little bit of a headwind here in the first quarter and pricing pretty much a little bit more than offset that how do you see that dynamic going forward do you expect raws to maybe flatten out in the second quarter and then maybe turn into a tailwind in the back half or and similarly on pricing pricing seem to hold up well given the relatively weak demand environment do you expect that to continue to offset and hopefully more than offset the raw materials as you try to get back margin that was lost over last couple of years on that price raw dynamic ben schlater hey kevin yes i think it ll we view it all happen just as you described it will flatten out in the second quarter we ll start to see some benefit there and then we expect to get sequentially better in the third and fourth quarter kevin hocevar ok perfect thank you very much operator thank you we ll get to our next question on the life of mike harrison with seaport global securities please go right ahead mike harrison hi good morning peter thomas hey mike ben schlater hi mike harrison just continuing the questions related to ultramarine i seem to recall that you were adding some additional ultramarine and micronized iron oxide capacity in columbia that was supposed to be coming on stream early in 2019 did that come on stream as expected and kind of how does that impact the i guess supply and demand dynamics around ultramarine peter thomas the answer is yes and quite candidly it s good that we ve added that capacity and we re planning additional capacity expansions as we speak mike harrison all right and then also maybe to to just continue on some of the pricing discussion you ve been pretty aggressive and gotten some of the best pricing you ve gotten ever in my history with the company as i look over the past several quarters do you have any sense that in pigments or in tile or maybe in any of your other businesses you reached a point where you ve pushed maybe a little bit too hard on pricing and maybe you re still you re in situations where you re starting to see customers walk away or look for alternatives or you ve pushed them intentionally too hard and lost some volume that way just maybe comment on that kind of i m pushing on pricing versus maintaining or losing volume dynamic peter thomas well now you just hit one of the reasons why we wanted to reposition the portfolio into the high end markets the higher up we are in the markets the more our ability to raise prices and keep it because people realize they re paying for our technology and at the end of the day we always have competitive intensity like i always joke with you in the past my knowledge where we have a knife fight in a telephone booth anymore that doesn t exist we pick and choose where we want to play and the high end of our position in every market segment serve we can maintain a nice level pricing and we re being orderly methodical about it if we choose for whatever reason the answer the second part of your question do we look at every pound that goes out the door to every customer the answer is yes do we know that for every manufacturing location the answer is yes do we know what the gross margin is for every pound that goes out our plants the answer is yes and we use that in our marketing and sales activities to determine what a pricing policy would be in order to lift the margins to a point where they re acceptable and if that s successful it s great if it s not that would be a lead leading indicator of the type of volume we would want to extract from the portfolio but in this optimized environment we will also remove the fixed cost this will constantly enhance the portfolio of the company kevin grant operator we have time for one last question operator certainly we ll get to our next question on the line from david begleiter from deutsche bank please go right ahead david begleiter thank you peter just back on the high end tile coatings destocking typically did it continue into april peter thomas there yes there were a couple companies but not for the reason of just destocking it s because some of the very high end customers that are moving faster with the leadership positions and the larger tiles for construction and home use like for countertops or table tops they were a little more winning out their old capacity so they can reposition with the new stuff it was more of a repositioning rather than a destocking if you will that s how i would look at it david begleiter and how would you peter thomas because those are those customers david that as they re coming out of it because of the the gross margin of those products it s helping the absorption as we discussed david begleiter and how do you quantify the impact in q2 performance coatings from either absorption issues or destocking issues or some combination of the both versus the 9 million versus the 26 million and 9 million that you had in q1 ben schlater hey david it s ben so we should see that come back and improve in q2 from a destocking perspective as peter said most of that was out of the way in april and we should see sequential benefit in performance coatings in the second quarter both from volume absorption as well as raw materials david begleiter thank you kevin grant we would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today we appreciate your interest in ferro and we look forward discussing results with you again next quarter enjoy the rest of your day operator duration 59 minutes call participants kevin grant peter thomas ben schlater rosemarie morbelli mike sison john mcnulty kevin hocevar mike harrison david begleiter more foe

challenges for bank profitability speech by luis de guindos vice president of the ecb omfif city lecture london 1 may 2019 introduction sustained economic expansion over the past six years and greater banking sector resilience have supported financial stability within the euro area but the recent softening of growth prospects heightens risks the financial stability environment has become more challenging than it was a year ago the risks that have been with us for some time now a possible disorderly increase in risk premia debt sustainability concerns low bank profitability and imbalances in the non bank financial sector are still present but they are no longer being mitigated by an improving macroeconomic outlook indeed the deteriorating macro outlook renders some of these risks more acute in particular it may reawaken concerns over debt sustainability and worsen the outlook for bank profitability debt sustainability concerns could drive up sovereign bond spreads in turn higher spreads generate losses on bond portfolios and higher market based funding costs for financial institutions bank profitability tends to go hand in hand with economic activity slower growth prospects may dent bank profitability through a reduction in lending activity and a possible increase in credit impairments moreover the ongoing political uncertainties including trade disputes and the softer economic momentum may trigger volatility in asset prices and if a sudden disorderly increase in risk premia were to materialise it could further elevate banks funding costs against this backdrop i am going to focus my remarks today on bank profitability returning banks to sustainable rates of profitability is a key step towards ensuring that the sector remains resilient particularly in the face of slowing economic momentum and the potential for market distress euro area banks have certainly improved their profitability in recent years their return on equity reached 6 at the end of 2018 up from 3 two years earlier but their profitability remains below their long run cost of capital which most banks estimate to be in the range of 8 10 low profitability prospects translate into low bank valuations as observed in price to book ratios well below one hindering the ability to raise capital where needed european bank profitability has been structurally weak since well before unconventional monetary policy measures were introduced broadly speaking the sources of that weakness can be divided into cyclical factors cost inefficiencies and competitive challenges arising from outside the sector before discussing these sources let me begin by reminding you why bank profitability is important why bank profitability matters clearly bank profitability matters for financial stability profits are the first line of defence against losses from credit impairment retained earnings are an important source of capital enabling banks to build strong buffers to absorb additional losses those buffers ensure that banks are able to provide financial services to euro area households and businesses even in the face of adverse developments thereby smoothing rather than amplifying the impact of negative shocks on the real economy banks with poor structural profitability can face higher funding costs and may be tempted to take on more risk within the euro area weak banks are more likely than healthy banks to be connected to unprofitable firms this reduces the flow of lending to profitable firms that need funding to invest and grow the resultant misallocation of capital towards unproductive businesses weighs on long run economic growth low bank profitability can also matter for monetary policy by impairing the accumulation of bank capital over time thinly capitalised banks stymie the ability of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity in downturns their capacity to lower the interest rates they charge their customers and increase the volume of lending to the real economy is constrained this limits the effectiveness of an important transmission channel of monetary accommodation in the euro area which relies on bank lending supporting consumption and investment as the crisis showed dislocations in the banking sector can deepen recessions and seriously impair the smooth transmission of monetary policy across the euro area that risk remains today we recently carried out what we call a macroprudential stress test which assesses this amplification of shocks using a micro macro model that feeds back individual bank reactions into macroeconomic outcomes on the basis of the 2018 european wide stress test data we estimate that the banks behavioural reaction to the adverse scenario exacerbates the fall in gdp by a further 1 6 with respect to the initial shock which itself further depletes banks capital cyclical factors given that important link between bank behaviour and the cycle let me turn to the cyclical factors affecting bank profitability in the euro area the economic expansion continued through 2018 although with a sizeable reduction in the pace of growth relative to the previous year since the trough the number of people in employment has increased by over 10 million while the data since the end of 2018 have been weak notably in manufacturing and the external sector the economic fundamentals remain in place to support continued expansion the economic expansion and employment growth have supported bank profitability loan growth has been robust in recent years with higher volumes helping to mitigate margin compression the stock of non performing loans npls has been substantially reduced outstanding npls fell by 142 billion in 2018 and the aggregate ratio dropped to 3 8 of significant banks loans at the end of 2018 from 7 at the end of 2015 npls represent a double drag on bank profitability first npls have to be recognised and provisioned for reducing current profitability indeed the major driver of the increase in bank profitability over the past two years has been the smaller flow of new impairments but even when fully provisioned npls hamper profitability by tying up scarce capital without providing returns absorbing operational capacity and incurring legal and administrative costs while npl ratios have improved over the course of the expansion overall revenue growth remains subdued across the banking sector aggregate net interest income as a share of equity fell marginally between 2015 and 2018 although it is still higher than in countries such as the united kingdom that have not had negative policy rates yet a number of euro area banks have successfully delivered robust earnings in recent years a recent study by the ecb highlighted the differences between this group and the remainder of significant euro area banks the median of these best performers managed to lift its return on equity by 3 6 percentage points in 2014 17 relative to 2009 13 by contrast the median profitability for other significant banks was essentially unchanged between those periods the best performers managed to keep net interest income growing roughly in line with costs whereas the other banks generally witnessed cost growth outpacing growth in net interest income moreover the best performers managed to increase net fee and commission income by more than half between 2009 and 2017 relative to the less than 10 growth managed by the remainder developing sustainable revenue streams beyond net interest income such as fee and commission income remains vital in order to buttress profitability in the coming years the low interest rate environment is with us for the foreseeable future and is caused in large part by durable structural factors the interest rate below which monetary policy is accommodative has fallen in the euro area as is the case in much of the developed world even once monetary policy normalises interest rates are likely to remain below levels that were common in previous decades cost inefficiencies the second source of low profitability for euro area banks is enduring cost inefficiencies cost to income ratios remain high in the euro area relative to international peers the euro area has too many banks too many branches and too many bankers the aggregate cost to income ratio of euro area banks reached 66 in 2018 up from 62 in 2010 as the dip in revenues was not offset by cost containment while similar to that of peers in japan and the united kingdom it is above the ratio typical for us banks and substantially above the ratio of roughly 50 for nordic banks reducing costs requires grasping the opportunities offered by technology banks have been able to make greater reductions in the density of the branch network in countries where the take up of online banking is higher the number of branches in the netherlands and the baltic states has halved since 2008 but progress in other countries has been much more limited technology can also help enhance operational efficiency by improving processes for loan origination and servicing and enable workloads to be shared better across employees in multiple locations that requires substantial investment in information technology it the best performing euro area banks i mentioned earlier increased their it spending by around 60 between 2009 and 2017 whereas the remaining banks increased theirs by just 10 such investment is expensive but has proven worthwhile the cost to income ratio for the median of the best performers fell by 5 5 percentage points whereas that for the median of the other banks increased by 3 1 percentage points the other source of higher costs for euro area banks is the adjustment to a suite of post crisis regulation this includes holding greater amounts of high quality capital and debt instruments that can be bailed in should resolution become necessary it is also more difficult now to increase measured profitability by increasing leverage and whilst international requirements on loss absorption only apply to the most systemic banks so called g sibs and the basel standards typically apply to internationally active banks in the euro area such requirements are applied to all banks of course such regulations have been put in place in recognition of the significant public costs borne throughout the banking crisis and regulation cannot be seen as the main driver of costs nordic banks operate under the same regulatory framework and have been able to attain a high rate of profitability but one key element in regulation worth noting is the lack of waivers for liquidity and capital in the euro area as a result euro area cross border banking groups potentially face higher costs than interstate banking groups in the united states this recourse to ring fencing takes a narrow national perspective at present national deposit insurance schemes will be drawn upon should depositors need to be compensated during bank resolution hence the desire of national authorities to ensure that each national subsidiary is sufficiently capitalised and has adequate liquidity completing banking union including the introduction of a european deposit insurance scheme and the removal of the remaining national options and discretions would help ensure that the costs of resolution are equitably shared meanwhile it would enable banks to use liquidity and capital efficiently at the euro area level competition from outside the sector the final challenge for bank profitability comes from increasing competition from outside the sector in particular from financial technology companies fintech and non bank financial companies lightly regulated fintech companies have begun to encroach into the realm of payment and settlement systems more than 60 of incumbents view fintechs as a threat to their income from these activities given the greater desire by consumers for instant payments and the use of mobile payments investment in it is vital to secure future revenue streams banks also face increasing competition in the provision of credit total assets of non bank financial intermediaries doubled in the euro area between 2008 and 2017 whereas total banking sector assets remained broadly unchanged the growth is particularly marked in the investment fund sector around 28 of euro area non financial company debt issuances are held by euro area investment funds compared with 18 pre crisis the greater provision of market based credit is welcome and indeed the capital markets union agenda has been put in place with this aim in mind but banks will need to carefully consider how to adjust their business models to accommodate this greater degree of competition it certainly increases the urgency to improve efficiency in credit provision conclusion let me conclude the structurally low profitability of the euro area banking sector remains a concern for financial stability and for monetary policy return on equity below the cost of capital is unsustainable in the long run the causes of low profitability are for the most part structural and hence require structural solutions successful implementation of long run profitable business plans is essential consolidation remains necessary there are a number of benefits arising from cross border consolidation cross border holdings of deposits and loans can help bolster economic resilience within the euro area by helping to smooth shocks through income sharing such private sector risk sharing channels play an important role in smoothing shocks in the united states but currently smooth a much smaller share in the euro area moreover it can provide benefits for the banks themselves in general more geographically diversified banks have displayed stronger revenue performance in recent years but there are a number of national banking sectors that would also benefit from consolidation within national borders allowing for greater cost synergies and rationalisation of branch networks such consolidation would permit small and medium sized banks to attain sufficient scale to undertake the it investment necessary to meet the challenges of the digital era while both national and cross border consolidation options are potentially viable the key consideration for financial stability is that the combined entity should be able to successfully execute the merger resulting in a bank that can sustain profitability in the long run

prepared remarks operator good morning thank you for joining the ferro corporation 2019 first quarter earnings conference call an archived replay of this teleconference will be available through the investor information section at ferro com later today and will be available for approximately seven days i would now like to turn the call over to mr kevin cornelius grant director investor relations and corporate communications kevin grant thank you and good morning everyone welcome to ferro s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call this morning we ll be reviewing ferro s financial results for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 i m pleased today to be joined today by peter thomas our chairman president and ceo and ben schlater group vice president and chief financial officer the earnings release and conference call presentation deck are available in the investors section of our website i d like to remind everyone that some of the comments we are making today are forward looking statements and are based on our view of conditions and circumstances as we see them today however those views may change as conditions and circumstances change please refer to the forward looking statement disclosure in the earnings release and the earnings presentation more from the motley fool also today s call will contain various operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis descriptions of these non gaap financial measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings release and presentation deck we encourage you to view that information in conjunction with today s discussion it s now my pleasure to pass the call over to peter story continues peter thomas good morning everyone thank you for joining us today the first quarter proved to be challenging and tested our business as demand softened fortunately we have a level of resiliency relative to any one market because of our diversified customer base and an orientation to enable this but enables us to adapt quickly to market conditions that s not to say that we are satisfied with the quarter s results we are not but we are focused on a longer view in making the right decisions to achieve sustainable growth like many of the companies in our space we experience softer demand during the first quarter in some of the markets in which we participate in certain of the higher end and niche markets that we moved into in recent years the order patterns and inventory destocking are different from what we see at the mid level of the markets particularly in tile this contributed to weaker demand in both the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2019 impacting margins as well as sales customers at the high end of the tile market that were stocking about six months of inventory shifted several months ago to maintaining three to four months of inventory we anticipated that these customers would build back to a six month inventory level in the first quarter but they have not yet done so and it seems that some are still ordering just in time levels absorption also played a role in the first quarter decline in earnings the destocking we discussed contributed to lower volumes at some of our larger facilities eroding profitability we expect to offset these absorption headwinds in the second half of 2019 with increased volume throughput and benefits from our optimization initiatives i ll comment further on the remainder of the year later in my prepared remarks we learned from this experience and we will use the knowledge we gained about this market dynamic as we go forward from challenging circumstances we intend to make ourselves better economic conditions especially in europe and china also affected our business in the first quarter because a significant portion of ferro s revenue comes from europe we felt the negative impact much less of our revenue comes from china but we still felt the effects of relative weaker demand there i don t know that we have a clear line of sight to recovery from the slowdown in europe but it s worth noting that government stimulus in china may improve conditions there and this may in turn positively affect europe closer to home weather was a factor in the united states construction markets which impacted building projects and reduced demand from customers served by our color solutions pigments business in addition headwinds from foreign exchange rates negatively impacted sales by about 21 million so all in all not a good quarter after strong performances in 2017 and 2018 but there were positives that demonstrate the flexibility of our business model and reinforce what we said about outperforming the markets where we participate we believe we can outperform the markets because of the value we bring to our customers and our ability to increase productivity through optimization initiatives examples of outperformance include automotive industrial and surface technology sub segments all of which we expect will outperform their markets for the year we remain enthusiastic about ferro s position in relation to certain mega trends within society that should continue to create opportunities for growth in these businesses for example we see exciting opportunities for our surface technologies business in connection with the move to 5g technology and we see opportunities for our electronics business in north america as more and more smart technology is added to automobiles we will continue to manage through this time of global macro economic uncertainty with judicious investment managing leverage and continuing to execute innovation and optimization initiatives regarding optimization we review optimization as a means to increase productivity and efficiency and become a better more profitable company we ve built a culture committed to improvement involving and getting better all the time by innovating growing updating and optimizing the business never being complacent optimization becomes even more crucial when managing through macroeconomic weaknesses as previously discussed we have implemented a number of optimization initiatives including consolidating manufacturing sites logistical facilities and r d labs the largest of these the americas manufacturing optimization initiative which we have discussed previously will begin contributing to adjusted ebitda this year we have a number of other optimization initiatives under way or planned as well with opportunities throughout the company our optimization efforts include optimizing our portfolio to continue to position ferro as an advanced technology partner enhance our market position after 20 acquisitions we are taking a good look at how best to optimize our portfolio going forward as appropriate we ll provide more details on this and other optimization efforts currently under way or completed in the future now let s turn to the performance of our three business segments in the first quarter in the presentation deck you can see summaries on slide 5 let begin with our performance coatings segment performance coatings volumes were up 2 8 while net sales on a constant currency basis were down 2 1 to 170 3 million adjusted gross profit decreased to 33 9 million from 41 1 million gross profit margin declined to 19 9 from 23 6 reflecting the shift in mix and volume due to the destocking and inventory re positioning i described earlier the dynamic that we experienced with the high end of the tile market has given us a greater appreciation for the destocking process in the high end segment of the market we have now gone through a cycle of strong growth as well as a period of weaker demand and a reset by our customers of inventory levels with the transition of our portfolio in recent years to sell more into the higher space we now better understand this dynamic and our customers purchasing habits now let s look at our performance colors and glass segment in the first quarter performance colors and glass volumes improved 9 4 with net sales on a constant currency basis up 5 3 organic sales improved 3 adjusted gross profit declined to 39 5 million from 41 2 million gross profit margin declined to 32 7 from sales increased by approximately 10 in our industrial business much of this increase was attributable to increased sales of our digital printing technology we believe we have a great opportunity with this technology to transition to flat glass market to digital printing our electronic materials business grew approximately 13 in the quarter this was driven by sales of multi layered film paste and tapes for sensors dielectrics and capacitors which are used in heavy duty applications such as automotive airspace and military applications after a strong year of market growth in 2018 sales in our automotive business were down low mid single digits we continue to see pressure in north america which accounted for the majority of the decline in our automotives sales europe was up low single digits but offset by decline in asia pacific this performance was not a surprise as we expected 2019 to be weaker and we expect continued weakness in our automotive business throughout the course of the year decoration was down low single digits in the quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to strong demand for off cycle container glass in the prior year now turning to the color solutions segment in the first quarter color solutions net sales on a constant currency basis were flat while volumes were down 4 2 adjusted gross profit came in at 29 3 million as compared to 31 6 million in the prior year gross profit margin declined to 30 5 from 32 8 first quarter sales of our pigments were affected by softer demand in the construction and building market due to weather in the united states as well as a shift in the automotive market away from ultramarine blues the slower start of the year in our pigments business was offset by a stronger demand for our surface technology products now let s talk a little bit about what lies ahead many companies in our space expect the second quarter to be similar to the first relatively weak ferro s second quarters typically are strongest so we are optimistic about the second quarter ramping up from the first we perceive there to be a general expectation in the markets we serve that the second half of 2019 will be better than the first half we generally share those sentiments based on indicators that we see in our business although i will not say that we have clear visibility into remainder of the year uncertainly around trade talks brexit and the auto markets in asia cloud the horizon looking still further ahead to 2020 although market conditions have softened since 2017 when we introduced our 2020 goals we still have a pathway and we are focusing our teams on achieving those goals i ll now turn the call over to ben for his comments ben schlater thank you peter and good morning everyone i d like to start out this morning discussing our consolidated finance results for the first quarter 2019 please note that the non gaap numbers i refer to are on an adjusted basis and growth rates mentioned are on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2018 the financial highlights and results can be reviewed on slide 3 and 4 in the presentation accompanying today s call which you can find on ferro com in the investor section turing to slide 4 in the first quarter we grew net sales 0 7 to 387 5 million while adjusted gross profit declined 9 6 to 102 9 million adjusted sg a expense was 69 3 million or 17 9 of net sales and adjusted ebitda declined to 47 9 million or 12 4 of net sales and adjusted eps declined to 0 22 for the first quarter there were a few non gaap adjustments primarily related to our corporate development acquisition and optimization activities first in cost of sales we have adjustments of approximately 1 million primarily due to costs related to optimization initiatives in sg a we have one time adjustments of 2 8 million in the quarter consisting of legal professional and other expenses related to certain corporate development activities and certain optimization initiatives including the manufacturing optimization we announced earlier this year turning to restructuring and impairment there was an adjustment of approximately 2 1 million in the first quarter related to actions to achieve our ongoing optimization initiatives and acquisition synergies finally in the quarter under other income and expense we had an adjustment of about 100 000 related primarily to optimization costs now moving to sg a in the first quarter adjusted sg a expense was 69 3 million or 17 9 of net sales compared with 66 1 million or 17 2 of net sales in the prior year quarter as stated on a constant currency basis newly acquired businesses accounted for the majority of the increase while base company sg a was nearly flat year over year this brings me to adjusted free cash flow adjusted free cash flow was in line with our expectations with the use of 45 3 million in the first quarter compared to 42 4 million use in the prior year we have reconfirmed our prior full year free cash flow conversion guidance of 45 to 50 we define adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations as gaap net cash provided by operating activity less capex then we add back cash used for our most recently announced manufacturing optimization acquisition related items and restructuring activity the most meaningful components for the quarter are as follows starting with gaap net income of 13 9 million we add 15 1 million of depreciation and amortization less 100 million for working capital plus 4 million of a change in other balance sheet items and less 0 5 million of other non cash p l items to arrive at cash used from operating activities of 67 5 million on a gaap basis then we subtract 23 3 million of capital expenditures and add cash received on other receivables of 20 2 million to arrive at 70 7 million of free cash flow use in the first quarter our practice has been to adjust this number for cash flow related to our strategic activities these include one cash related to our recently announced manufacturing optimization two m a related cash flow and three cash flow from restructuring programs a quantification of those three adjustments for the year are as follows 21 2 million for optimization projects 2 3 million related to m a and 1 9 million related to restructuring when we add these items back to our gaap number this brings adjusted free cash flow use for the year to 45 3 million compared to the prior year at 42 4 million the details of this calculation and the related reconciliation to gaap operating cash flow can be found on table 10 of the press release with respect to capital allocation in the first quarter we repurchased approximately 1 4 million shares of our stock for approximately 25 million at an average share price of 17 35 further we ended the first quarter with approximately 470 million of liquidity and leverage of approximately 3 4x consistent with our expectation from our year end call now i d like to spend some time reviewing our updated 2019 guidance as i mentioned earlier we are maintaining our adjusted free cash flow conversion between 45 and 50 however given the weakness that we saw in the first quarter and economic uncertainties we have updated our adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps guidance for the full year 2019 we expect adjusted ebitda in a range of 250 million to 260 million and adjusted eps in a range of 1 35 to 1 45 in summary we want to be clear that our guidance from our year end call is updated primarily to reflect a review of the end markets with the other components remaining approximately the same to add clarity to the guidance our ebitda bridge from 2018 to 2019 is as follows beginning with 2018 ebitda of 259 million we add the aggregate benefit from the americas manufacturing optimization net raw materials and acquisitions in a range of 22 million to 28 million for the year which is largely in line with the original guidance we gave last quarter then we subtract 8 million to 9 million for fx updated slightly to reflect the euro to u s dollar exchange rate at 1 12 finally we subtract 18 million to 20 million of organic headwinds which reflects the current market landscape and economic uncertainties that peter and i have highlighted today on the call i would also note that roughly two thirds of the organic headwind has been realized in the first quarter with the largest component related to destocking in our tile business and is already behind us we expect the balance to taper off throughout the remainder of the year to sum up those pieces to the 2018 adjusted ebitda of 259 million equals our guidance range of 250 million to 260 million for 2019 now turning to our walk for eps starting at our adjusted eps for 2018 of 1 50 we expect the aggregate benefit from the americas manufacturing optimization net raw materials and acquisitions to be within the range of 0 20 to 0 25 for the year again largely in line with the original guidance we gave last quarter then we subtract 0 05 to 0 06 for fx again updated slightly to reflect the u s to euro exchange rate at 1 12 and from there we subtract 0 14 to 0 18 of organic headwinds again roughly 2 3 of which has been realized in the first quarter finally we subtract 0 08 to 0 09 for the change in our tax rate and 0 01 to 0 02 for increased interest expense both of which are unchanged from our guidance last quarter the sum of those pieces to the 2018 adjusted eps of 1 50 equals our guidance range of 1 35 to 1 45 for 2019 to wrap up our comments on guidance i would like to give some context to how we view the remaining quarters of 2019 we expect the second quarter to meaningfully improve from the first quarter with adjusted eps in the range of 23 to 24 of our updated full year 2019 guidance of 1 35 to 1 45 further given the current macro themes and market conditions including the destocking in tile weaker euro zone and softer growth in china we expect the third quarter to be our strongest quarter followed by the fourth quarter as our guidance calls for a stronger economy in the second half of 2019 further if raw material prices remain at current levels we would expect sequential margin expansion in the second half of this year our 2019 guidance reflects foreign exchange spot rates as of 03 31 2019 including 1 12 for the euro against the dollar we have provided fx sensitivities in the guidance section of the earnings release in 2018 ferro generated approximately 40 to 45 of revenue in euros and approximately 25 to 30 in u s dollars we estimate that a 1 overall change in foreign currently exchange rates weighted for the countries where we do business would impact sales by approximately 10 million to 12 million and operating profit by 1 5 million to 1 7 million if you isolate for sensitivity on the euro a 1 change would impact operating profit by approximately 1 1 million to 1 3 million finally i would like to just build on what peter mentioned that we are constantly reviewing and taking steps to keep the company as nimble as possible to adapt to changes in the macro economic landscape focusing on what s in our control and maintaining our focus on cash and leverage with that i will turn the call over to kevin for q a kevin grant thanks ben with that operator let s open up the call for our first question questions answers operator thank you very much and we ll proceed with our first question on the line from rosemarie morbelli with g research please go ahead rosemarie morbelli thank you and good morning everyone peter thomas good morning rosemarie ben schlater good morning rosemarie morbelli so looking at the results peter it seems as though performance coatings is obviously where you are having the most issues it is also your lowest margin business is there any consideration of selling it and immediately upgrading your portfolio and lowering your debt and potentially buying back stock is that something that management and the board are considering peter thomas as you know we pride ourselves on having a whole range of opportunities with this portfolio whether it s inorganic or organic and the optimization initiatives that we re going to further define here we are always in it in the interest of creating a better version of ourselves and we look at every opportunity to exercise that activity rosemarie morbelli ok i guess the answer is maybe yes so now looking at your optimization program i understand that it has been focused on north america and mostly the u s have you expanded those activities into europe peter thomas let me let me mention something to you because i like to always refer back to prior calls a year ago when we were further defining the optimization activity that we have announced which represented 30 million plus and we ve mentioned we would see around 8 million this year we would have the balance next year i also mentioned that during the exercise that we were building an optimization pipeline that probably would add another 12 million to 15 million of profitability so what i will share with you today is that in this environment which is very challenging certainly we work by the world you really can t worry about what you can t control but you certainly have control of how you manage through it and what i can tell you is that our organization as a whole has been phenomenal in embracing our strategy and the framework of the strategy and the fact that optimization is very important and that s why it s phase 4 the idea is 2020 targets we get there with a combination of organic inorganic and innovation as well as optimization activities we have a lot of levers to pull and i will tell you now that our expectation going into next year is that by the end of the year we ll have a run rate of about 15 million of new opportunities and profitability on top of what we ve already mentioned i will you re going to ask the question about where are we the answer is we did pull many of those levers some are staggering in some we re including in this guidance some of them were not because we will not do it until we have the right visibility because of the sensitivity of some of the projects and each quarter we ll fairly methodically like we always do we ll share those details but rest assured we are not sitting back we re not sitting here saying we just uncovered something we ve been planning this for a very very long time so it was easy for us to embrace pull the trigger and start executing some of those projects are already done and we have seen the value and we are very good as you know around managing the optimization side of this business so the news today is we re looking at a run rate of another 15 million next year rosemarie morbelli so that is in addition to the 30 million just clarifying here peter thomas yes and it s if you go back a year ago i did kind of mention that we had another 12 million to 15 million hiding in there that when the time was right that we would pull the trigger and we re doing that rosemarie morbelli ok and then if i may so peter thomas rosemarie morbelli i m sorry peter thomas well we ve done it already rosemarie morbelli ok so if i translate what ben talked about regarding the second quarter then your second quarter is going to be still substantially lower than last year second quarter at about 0 34 versus 0 44 are you expecting the second half while improving are you expecting it to be above 2018 ben schlater yes i think that that s implied in the guidance is that if you do the math on the second quarter we will see in the second half of the year a recovery from a year over year perspective rosemarie morbelli ok and then peter thomas yes what s rosemarie what s really important to note is that through all of this we re really back to what one would find define as being a normal order pattern for our business the second quarter i think we ve been pretty clear we feel really good about the sequencing of the second quarter being better than the first the third quarter being better than the second and i think there s a bit of an interesting dynamic that could be surfacing in the fourth quarter depending on we certainly know we re going against an ugly period last year and we know that the level of destocking where we sit today doesn t appear that s going to be as dramatic certainly because no one s really building their inventory levels up in an explosive way and yes i think the fourth quarter to be a very interesting quarter remember i think it was in maybe was in 17 we had a 9 year over year improvement in the fourth quarter from the prior year so the fourth quarter could be a pleasant surprise for us and i think if we keep doing what we re doing and i know we will we may have an interesting fourth quarter to show are you anticipating the this pattern the new pattern for the high end tiles to remain more or less the way they are meaning that they are not going back to building or six months say inventory supply but just sticking to the three to four months or even buying just some time is that in your projections that s a good point and i m glad you brought this up because we didn t get through the script and we re hoping it would come up it s a very interesting dynamic we ve discussed in the past the high end top producers typically would keep six months worth of inventory it swelled to seven to eight months during the hey hey of the first half of last year and then it precipitously dropped and in the middle of that activity as we were planning for the first quarter as you all know we did have we re so close to our customers and they were telling us that their objective was to build rebuild the inventories through the first quarter on a run rate basis that would be equivalent to what they defined as normalcy yet and maybe four to six months instead of something less in the meantime what s happened if you track the tile market right at the time where things were coming down in destocking there s been a very very substantial change in the demand in the type of tile that s moving forward and a lot of it has to deal with the larger sizes i mean i m not sure if everyone knows but part of the high end tile means that they have tiles that are three by five three by six five by six and some that could be as large as five by nines that would go into the industrial that s called commercial construction markets so while all this destocking took place coming out of this the demand for the type of tile moving into the new year has been more of the larger size which is more expensive and there s a lot of value to ferro in those tiles because we really are the market leader in supplying all the things that are necessary to give the design and the scale so rather than rebuilding their inventory with the old stuff they re orderly methodically ramping up to what one might define as even a repositioning of their inventory because they believe that the demand rather than coming from residential may be in the near term more construction oriented we do see our construction by the way in europe was up 8 so that s between glass and this larger tile exercise that we re speaking of so i think we had a dynamic here of the flush out but they re being orderly methodical around just in time with the old products but they were incrementally built through the course of the year with the bigger products and i think ben s point was very well taken more than two thirds of our issue organically is gone and what i can tell you we did a lot of work roughly the destocking cost this company maybe 26 million or so and 9 million to 10 million of gross profit so we have not built that adjustment into any of our forecast in fact if you separate the tile business from the rest of ferro what you re going to find through the course of the year where we stand today is we ll have upwards of 3 growth which is good in this environment and we have it made all the necessary assortments for us how we re kind of leaving that the way it s coming in we re listening to the customers they re being very orderly methodical and we don t want to make any decisions on what we think they re going to do or not do we want to leave it at this point where it is until we get into the second quarter because we ll have a better line of visibility with it operator thank you very much and we ll proceed with our next question on the line is from the line of mike sison with keybanc please go right ahead with your question mike sison hey guys peter thomas hey mike sison in terms of the in terms of the 18 million to 20 million sort of current landscape of demand what needs to happen to get that back over time and maybe walk us through the segments and what type of volume growth you d need to see ben schlater hey mike it s ben look i think it s a lot of what peter said so if you think about the impact from the destocking in the first quarter i think a piece of that is sort of the rebuilding of that inventory in the performance coatings piece of the business that would be my sense is as the single largest piece peter just reflected that we ve he said we have not built that into the guidance which is the case to the extent that that comes back that can come back in a quarter or two and to be a pretty significant lift to the numbers again we ve not reflected that in 2019 so that s performance coatings performance coatings in glass we re really not seeing anything from a from an overall weakness perspective i mean there s puts and takes autos a little slower electronics is much stronger and then with respect to color solutions we have seen slowness there in pigments primarily related to construction both in the u s and in europe and it looks like the second half of the year will be better from that perspective so i think that when you run rate the second half of if the second half of the year comes in as expected and you run rate that and we get an annualized impact from that you ll see a piece of that come back mike sison ok and then i think a lot of companies are looking for a second half improvement if you will some have given some thoughts in the event that there is no improvement so in the event there is no improvement in the second half how do you how does your outlook sort of change relative to where it is and where it is now peter thomas i think what we re showing mike reflects what we think is a reasonable case is building in that there if there s some softness is there i think what we re trying to do is be as predictable as we possibly can at this point we re giving you our best case we ve seen we don t see anything that is really chaotic or abstract to the end that you re referring to we have a lot of sensitivities model but i don t think it s really germane to even go there right now this is what we see we ve mentioned that the core business looks like 2 to 3 for the balance of the year the tile business we haven t built in that pickup in the type of inventory level we ve discussed i ve given you the dynamic that the destocking costs us 26 million in revenue about 9 million of gross profit so you can do some math around that if tile picks up how you might want to build that into your model if people get back to a position of normalcy with that inventory that s one way of looking at it and ben you may want to give the other dimension ben schlater yes i think mike the second half is i think there s two ways to look at it one is what s happening relative to the broader economy into what happened relative to the first half and i think that those are slightly different answers from the first half perspective the first quarter was down so significantly the second half is it sort of an even easier comp when compared sequentially and that s sort of what we ve reflected in the forecast i think if you look at the second half with respect to what we re expecting from an overall economic perspective it will be sort of a lift from the first half but that s mostly because of the destocking is behind us i would say we ve been relatively conservative from an overall organic growth perspective in the second half peter thomas yes mike let me add a couple more things i know where we are talking about the sensitivity about about what might win or use a downside but i think you heard what i mentioned that it was complemented with ben so let me let me give you another perspective because i think it s fair and balanced to discuss it one thing that s very important to know the rate of absorption increase will continue to drive our margin improvement particularly in the high end because you can see how it damaged us in the third fourth and first quarters if you will the second thing is the raw material tailwinds will continue regardless of what the sensitivity is about the economic environment one thing too we know that what we re seeing with our discussions with our customers around the world that positive trade agreements could spark higher auto and construction markets where we participate we re already around the world different areas i mentioned who else is telling you that construction is up 8 and in europe if you look at automotive applications i can share regional situations where we re growing double digits we know that the lower backs in china will favorably support our positions but more importantly it s what it does to europe rather than what it does to china indigenously because we know based on our contacts that the chinese government are certainly they re it s making efforts to boost sales around the automotive and coatings market so we have where we participate we re hearing that from our customers things will happen there and we feel very comfortable and again although europe is soft we will continue to outperform our european gdp driven by what we ve already mentioned with auto and construction because even in this environment as i mentioned automotive in europe is so sharp and so was construction and don t forget the driver iran our digital printing is gaining traction in the flat glass market so that s what helps spur in this soft environment that that technology is gaining traction and again at the end of the day what i ve just highlighted with you we have a focus on delivering those optimization programs that are 15 million on our run rate so i think that you have heard a set discussion for me on the onset around we believe we re giving you a fair represented case then highlighted and i just summarized on hey take a look at what isn t in here and try to use that information to decide how you want to build your own sensitivities we have done it on a low end and the high end and we feel what we ve done here is a fair representation of what we see it without any we re not economists we re not foreign exchange experts we re sitting here being as accurate and predictive as we possibly can with a lot of probability at this point mike sison great thank you ben schlater thanks mike operator thank you very much we ll get to our next question on the line with john mcnulty with bmo capital markets please go right ahead with your question john mcnulty yes good morning thanks for taking my question with regard to the fixed cost absorption that you had in the first quarter i guess one can you quantify what that was and then also do you feel like you re kind of running at more normal rates at this point so we don t see that as a drag going forward ben schlater yes sure hey john it s ben if you look at the year over year headwind from a gross profit perspective at the base company level between lower volumes and absorption almost three quarters of the overall headwind is from lower volumes and absorption so it s the vast vast majority of it we are and we would expect and it s included in the guidance absorption to return to more normal levels as we get into the end of the second quarter and so we do show that sequential improvement quarter over quarter between now and the end of the year john mcnulty got it ok and then with regard to the emanate pipeline out there i mean you were certainly more aggressive with buying back your stock in the quarter i guess how do you see the pipeline and how does that compare to your stock at these levels and the sense of urgency to be buying back stock and taking advantage of the lower price peter thomas yes so john it s peter first of all our m a pipeline is no different than what we ve discussed we continue to run parallel paths around the technology buys versus what we would find as a real company and also i ve mentioned in my prepared remarks that after 20 acquisitions we believe we ve stuffed our pipeline technology pipelines across all the businesses in a way that in addition to doing what we would normally do as we have been we re looking at things that could be maybe a bit more impactful to the business that would complement the more of an adjacent play at a bigger scale versus what we ve already created because remember where we are is that we now have about a 15 share in a 10 billion to 12 billion market versus 12 where we was a 4 billion market and we had a 50 we ve reached a point where we re managing the spread between organic growth and inorganic growth i mean as we were moving up in the early days we were more inorganic than organic then the vitality index pumped in and we re sitting at a nice balance we needed to get the organization to this point before we move forward because we re using a lot of math around us how do you what s spread between inorganic and organic do you run for a while in a way that lets your organization adjust to it and then now we re at a point where we want to do we believe we need to be a little more impactful on creating a better version of ferro it doesn t mean that we re going to stop it because right now the first half of this year we re working on and rightly so optimization activities making sure we feel good about what we re doing with our capital structure and of course you know we re trying to see if we can do something more meaningful and of course everything whether it s big or large takes the same amount of time but the orientation for the first half of this year is getting the infrastructure optimized looking get some bigger things while we still are moving along with a with the deals right now i can tell you we continue to always look at five in that zone that i ve mentioned that we could pull the trigger on but i can also tell you we re looking at three or four things that are more meaningful so yes we have we re expanding more ground here in terms are our ground of looking at expanding the business so we ll see what happens i mean we in the second half of the year i m sure that something will go on whatever that is and at that point we keep making the adjustments and how we want to manage the capital structure ben do you want to add anything to that ben schlater no no that s right john mcnulty ok great no that s helpful and then i guess just the last question you d mentioned in some of the prepared remarks around the opportunities in 5g can you help us to think about what or what the scale in terms of revenues might be over the next couple of years in those opportunities for you peter thomas yes i will tell you as much as i can because we re under a lot of secrecy agreements but as relates to 5g with us and you would i know you know the chemistry a lot of it has to deal around let s call them ceramic filters or telecommunication as well as strong vehicle to vehicle communications as well as linking with cellphones and also what can be done from the house to the car so there are a lot of novel things that are going on that i wish i could tell you work is very exciting but if you want to quantify something like that right now our pipeline for those activities would be over and above our vitality index you remember john i think when we were out with you we talked about developing another layer of an innovation vitality index if you will and that pipeline is growing nicely and 5g for us in that particular pipeline could be as much as 100 million and we ve only been working on a short period of time and again the margins are really rich there but they re fast paced and we re under secrecy agreement but we are we are gaining traction with that so we re very excited that s one of the things that i did want to mention with all of this destocking that s take place and people are focusing on their businesses we ve had more very intriguing r d conversations with our customers in terms of advancing their technologies as you know when you re in a rapid growth mode like we ve seen in 16 17 and 18 everybody s busy just getting the job done well some time has been freed up and i can tell you that our r d teams working with all of our top customers the discussions between the r d organizations have been more robust than i ve seen since 2015 so i think sometimes that s a feeder for the future and again we are of the the partner of choice with all the technology platforms we ve amassed and i did have a discussion about that trend in the last couple of calls i mean right now ferro s sitting on what we call as roughly 55 leading technology platforms that we ve acquired 34 on over the last 20 acquisitions so you can imagine with more free time like it s out there and all the intellectual property with all the market leading companies there are a lot of interesting things going on that going forward will certainly help our current vitality index as base organic growth but then help us build the innovation vitality index so we ll start reporting against i think we re going to feel comfortable we have a couple of things that could hit here but we re under secrecy agreement but as they commercialize we ll start discussing that that vitality index does that help you john mcnulty yes no that s very helpful thanks very much for the color operator thank you very much we ll get to our next question on the line from kevin hocevar from north coast research please go right ahead kevin hocevar hey good morning everybody peter thomas hey kevin kevin hocevar hey peter i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks some shift in auto in the auto market away from ultramarine blue could you elaborate on that a little bit and how much of the weakness in color solutions was driven by that versus how much i know you quantified that the tile destocking do you have a sense for how much the weather impacted the color solutions business peter thomas probably slight i would estimate two thirds of the color solutions piece was due to the slowdown with weather and maybe construction overall the ultramarine blue discussion has to deal with variations of grays and blacks and it seemed like the last six months there were certain ultramarine gray kind of automotive colors that weren t being produced as much however it s starting to come back so basically anything that was negative with color solutions from where we sit today are turning positive and that s why i mentioned if you take all of our businesses including color solutions you have blow them off for the last three quarters from an organic perspective other than tile we re looking at 2 to 3 organic growth where we sit right now so it s coming back i mean i think in that was a short term key and we wanted to mention that because it s funny that in times like these type of color of an automobile that a consumer wants could vary depending on moods we ve learned a lot around the high end of the markets with the colors and the other things that we do depending on economic situations will dictate the type of color orientation so i think that the mood is getting better when the mood is better the ultramarine blue grays and violets will well it will come back and we re starting to see that does that help kevin hocevar yes very helpful and on the pricing raw material front it looks like looking at the q raws still a little bit of a headwind here in the first quarter and pricing pretty much a little bit more than offset that how do you see that dynamic going forward do you expect raws to maybe flatten out in the second quarter and then maybe turn into a tailwind in the back half or and similarly on pricing pricing seem to hold up well given the relatively weak demand environment do you expect that to continue to offset and hopefully more than offset the raw materials as you try to get back margin that was lost over last couple of years on that price raw dynamic ben schlater hey kevin yes i think it ll we view it all happen just as you described it will flatten out in the second quarter we ll start to see some benefit there and then we expect to get sequentially better in the third and fourth quarter kevin hocevar ok perfect thank you very much operator thank you we ll get to our next question on the life of mike harrison with seaport global securities please go right ahead mike harrison hi good morning peter thomas hey mike ben schlater hi mike harrison just continuing the questions related to ultramarine i seem to recall that you were adding some additional ultramarine and micronized iron oxide capacity in columbia that was supposed to be coming on stream early in 2019 did that come on stream as expected and kind of how does that impact the i guess supply and demand dynamics around ultramarine peter thomas the answer is yes and quite candidly it s good that we ve added that capacity and we re planning additional capacity expansions as we speak mike harrison all right and then also maybe to to just continue on some of the pricing discussion you ve been pretty aggressive and gotten some of the best pricing you ve gotten ever in my history with the company as i look over the past several quarters do you have any sense that in pigments or in tile or maybe in any of your other businesses you reached a point where you ve pushed maybe a little bit too hard on pricing and maybe you re still you re in situations where you re starting to see customers walk away or look for alternatives or you ve pushed them intentionally too hard and lost some volume that way just maybe comment on that kind of i m pushing on pricing versus maintaining or losing volume dynamic peter thomas well now you just hit one of the reasons why we wanted to reposition the portfolio into the high end markets the higher up we are in the markets the more our ability to raise prices and keep it because people realize they re paying for our technology and at the end of the day we always have competitive intensity like i always joke with you in the past my knowledge where we have a knife fight in a telephone booth anymore that doesn t exist we pick and choose where we want to play and the high end of our position in every market segment serve we can maintain a nice level pricing and we re being orderly methodical about it if we choose for whatever reason the answer the second part of your question do we look at every pound that goes out the door to every customer the answer is yes do we know that for every manufacturing location the answer is yes do we know what the gross margin is for every pound that goes out our plants the answer is yes and we use that in our marketing and sales activities to determine what a pricing policy would be in order to lift the margins to a point where they re acceptable and if that s successful it s great if it s not that would be a lead leading indicator of the type of volume we would want to extract from the portfolio but in this optimized environment we will also remove the fixed cost this will constantly enhance the portfolio of the company kevin grant operator we have time for one last question operator certainly we ll get to our next question on the line from david begleiter from deutsche bank please go right ahead david begleiter thank you peter just back on the high end tile coatings destocking typically did it continue into april peter thomas there yes there were a couple companies but not for the reason of just destocking it s because some of the very high end customers that are moving faster with the leadership positions and the larger tiles for construction and home use like for countertops or table tops they were a little more winning out their old capacity so they can reposition with the new stuff it was more of a repositioning rather than a destocking if you will that s how i would look at it david begleiter and how would you peter thomas because those are those customers david that as they re coming out of it because of the the gross margin of those products it s helping the absorption as we discussed david begleiter and how do you quantify the impact in q2 performance coatings from either absorption issues or destocking issues or some combination of the both versus the 9 million versus the 26 million and 9 million that you had in q1 ben schlater hey david it s ben so we should see that come back and improve in q2 from a destocking perspective as peter said most of that was out of the way in april and we should see sequential benefit in performance coatings in the second quarter both from volume absorption as well as raw materials david begleiter thank you kevin grant we would like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today we appreciate your interest in ferro and we look forward discussing results with you again next quarter enjoy the rest of your day operator duration 59 minutes call participants kevin grant peter thomas ben schlater rosemarie morbelli mike sison john mcnulty kevin hocevar mike harrison david begleiter more foe

questions so that everyone has a chance to participate and with that i will hand the call over to emma emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks sef and hello everyone 2019 is an important year of execution for gsk and i m pleased we ve made good we ve made good progress this quarter with growth in sales in constant exchange rates across the group and an improved group margin group sales growth of 5 in cer terms reflected an increase in sales in all three of our global businesses with a particularly strong performance in vaccines the pharma business continues to shift its portfolio shape well with strong growth from new launches and although consumer had a slow quarter we remain confident and excited about the outlook for this business group adjusted operating margin this quarter was up one percentage point on a cer basis on a total basis earnings per share were up 42 to gbp0 168 and adjusted earnings per share increased 18 to gbp0 301 included within operating margin and eps there are a number of matters of note that benefited the quarter and ian will address these in just a moment nonetheless it s a strong start to the year and we reaffirm our full year guidance our free cash flow this quarter was in line with our expectations with gbp165 million impacted as you know by the launch of generic advair the phasing of rebates and higher restructuring charges all as anticipated two years ago this summer i laid out my long term priorities for the whole company innovation performance and trust all to be powered by a necessary culture change and we ve made a strong start to the focused areas for 2019 we ve continued to execute on our new product launches and have demonstrated strong growth with nucala and trelegy in respiratory and most notably in vaccines with shingrix strengthening our pipeline is critical to our long term success and we ve made good progress here too in hiv we ve already had good uptake for the first of our two drug regimens juluca and we re now seeing the next wave of important innovation come through last month we received us approval for the second of our two drug regimens in hiv for dovato and we re delighted to make this new treatment option available to treatment naive patients and just earlier this week we filed for the us approval of the first long acting injectable hiv treatment cabotegravir plus rilpivirine and we re planning for a potential launch in 2020 we re generating data to support three upcoming oncology filings for bcma in multiple myeloma for zejula in the first line maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer and for dostarlimab in endometrial cancer and we were pleased to close the transactions with merck as well as tesaro further strengthening our growing oncology pipeline in performance we ve continued to drive growth in sales and improvements in our profitability and we ve been working hard on the creation of the consumer health joint venture with pfizer and expect this transaction to close in the second half of the year integration planning is well under way and we ve recently announced the new leadership team for the jv bringing key talent from both companies into the joint venture including brian s counterpart chris slager the president of pfizer consumer healthcare who ll be leading our new combined americas business and lastly on trust we want gsk to continue to lead with a broader contribution to society the best way to build trust is to innovate and we re committed to giving you regular and transparent updates on our innovation progress you re going to hear from hal again on our progress at q2 this year we also remain committed to our global health agenda we re embedding our more focused approach to achieve maximum impact last week the world health organization initiated its first pilot of our rts s malaria vaccine in malawi and we ve also dosed the first patient in a phase 2 study for gsk656 in patients with drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis so in summary we ve had a strong start to an important year of execution with all of our priorities firmly on track so i ll now hand you over to ian who is going to give you more detail on our q1 financial performance iain mackay chief financial officer thanks emma and it s a pleasure for me to be speaking to you in my first quarter as cfo of gsk all the comments i ll make today will be on a constant currency basis except where i specify otherwise and i ll cover both total and adjusted results on slide 8 you ll see a summary of the group s results for q1 which was a strong quarter with 5 revenue growth driven by all three businesses group total operating profit is up 10 with total earnings per share up 42 and on an adjusted basis operating profit was up 9 and adjusted earnings per share up 18 there are number of factors benefiting the first quarter operating profit notably strong growth from shingrix and introduction of authorized generics favorable inventory adjustments in vaccines and phasing of our r d investments i ll go through these in more detail in a moment we delivered gbp165 million of free cash flow in the quarter in line with expectations and please bear in mind that cash flow generation is expected to be to be weighted toward the second half of the year net debt at the end of q1 was gbp27 1 billion the increase from the end of the year was primarily driven by the gbp4 billion acquisition of tesaro along with the adjustment arising from implementation of ifrs 16 of gbp1 3 billion on currency a weaker sterling particularly against the us dollar and japanese yen results in a tailwind of 1 on sales and 4 to adjusted eps slide 9 summarizes the reconciliation of our total to adjusted results the main adjusting items in the quarter were charges relating to intangibles resulting from the tesaro acquisition major restructuring focused on the supply chain representing non cash charges relating to ramp up of the program we announced in july 2018 undervaluation of the embedded derivative in respect of gsk s exposure to movements in hindustan unilever s share price my comments from here onwards are on adjusted results unless stated otherwise on the next few slides we ve listed some of the key drivers of each business s performance and i ll also talk you through how we think they will evolve through the balance of the year slide 10 summarizes the pharmaceutical business where revenues were up 2 luke and david will take you through the performance of some of our key products shortly so i ll just point out a couple of important considerations the dolutegravir franchise delivered growth of 7 while the established hiv products represented a decrease in the quarter dolutegravir in europe showed a decline due to price erosion despite strong underlying volume growth as well as a release of government clawback payments in the comparator period looking ahead we continue to have confidence in the growth outlook of our hiv business our two drug regimen portfolio is important to our future growth and we anticipate dovato will become a key contributor but it will take several quarters as we generate more data gain broad reimbursement and as physicians gain experience with the product respiratory sales were up 25 reflecting the growth of the ellipta portfolio with trelegy delivering a strong performance as well as our injectable therapy nucala i want to remind you that from this quarter we are reporting the ellipta portfolio and nucala within the respiratory category and all other respiratory products including advair seretide under established products relvar breo declined 5 globally and 27 in the us despite good volume growth reflecting the impact of generic advair on pricing in the ics laba class which we ve been signaling for some time now we continue to expect breo to see a decline in the us in 2019 which will result in a slight global decline for relvar breo despite good growth expectations outside the united states our established pharmaceuticals portfolio declined 6 with us advair sales down 27 as expected following the approval of a generic competitor in february as we said at q4 it will take time for inventory levels in the market to adjust and respond to mylan supply there continues to be a number of moving factors including the successful launch for authorized generic which is providing a boost to q1 where the full impact of the mylan launch has yet to be felt keeping these factors in mind our outlook for advair remains unchanged ventolin performance was very strong in q1 also driven by the launch of an authorized generic in january and reflecting a one time benefit from the initial inventory build informed by these factors we still expect the pharmaceutical business revenues to see a slight decline in 2019 before returning to growth in 2020 driven by our new products including zejula dovato juluca trelegy and nucala turning to the operating margin we saw a decline in the quarter mainly driven by an unfavorable product mix due to impact of generic advair tesaro s ph evolution which in line with previous guidance we expect to have a sustained impact over the balance of 2019 and r d spend where we are increasing spending behind priority assets which will accelerate through 2019 slide 11 gives you a quick overview of vaccines performance in q1 with sales up 20 driven mainly by shingrix with continued strong demand in the united states we remain on track to deliver ph doses in line with guidance previously given with good progress made this quarter q1 revenues of gbp357 million is a good indicator of our current expectations of revenue run rate for the remainder of the year the momentum in vaccines business continues to give us confidence in the mid to high single digit outlook for sales compound annual growth out to 2020 in q1 we saw strong improvements in the operating margin driven by enhanced operating leverage particularly from shingrix in the us it is however worth noting that there was a favorable inventory adjustment in the quarter as a result we expect to see q2 vaccines operating margins more in line with our medium term guidance of mid 30s percent which we continue to expect for 2020 turning to slide 12 consumer sales grew 1 despite a drag of around 1 from the combined impact of divestments and the phasing out of low margin contract manufacturing this was a lower growth quarter as we signaled at q4 mainly due to a more competitive environment in europe we re seeing an improvement in performance driven by in market response and expect growth to pick up in q2 for 2019 we continue to expect reported growth to be impacted by the loss of around gbp100 million of revenue from the smaller divestments completed at the end of last year and the phasing out of contract manufacturing as we restructure the consumer supply chain operating profit improved in q1 resulting in an operating margin of 21 7 it s worth remembering that q1 is typically a higher margin quarter due to pre allergy season sell in margin improvements were driven by continued manufacturing simplification as well as ongoing strong cost control we re focused on ensuring we invest in the business to drive innovation and better growth and we expect to see this come through in the remainder of the year overall we remain confident in the prospects for the business and are on track to complete the transaction with pfizer in the second half of the year and the sale of horlicks to unilever by the end of the year subject to regulatory approvals on this next slide we summarize the sales and adjusted operating margin for the group which i ve already covered in some detail moving to the bottom half of the p l there are a couple of things i want to draw out your attention interest expense increased reflecting higher debt levels driven mainly by the tesaro acquisition also there is also an adverse comparison to q1 2018 which had a one off accounting adjustment of gbp20 million through amortization of interest charges the introduction of ifrs 16 in the quarter also resulted in an increase on the interest expense line of gbp11 million on associates we had a one time benefit of gbp51 million reflecting our increased share of after tax profits of innoviva as a result of a non recurring tax benefit and minorities declined reflecting the comparison with q1 2018 which was the last full quarter of distributions to novartis for their share in the previous consumer healthcare joint venture on free cash flow we remain focused on driving greater cash discipline across the group and generated gbp165 million of free cash flow in q1 the reduction from q1 2018 mainly reflects the adverse timing of payments for returns and rebates which we flagged to you at q4 and an increase in trade receivables on the back of stronger sales particularly in vaccines this was partly offset by improved operating profits and lower contingent consideration payments which last year included a milestone payment to novartis as previously noted and seen in prior years the generation of cash flows is expected to be weighted to the second half and we expect to see a step down as the impact of advair generic flows through and rebate payments are made on pre generic sales of advair for your reference we provided a slide in appendix bringing together the key points i made on our outlook for the year and to summarize our guidance for 2019 including that with respect to the dividend remains unchanged our financial priorities are improving working capital management and cash generation allocation of resources to key priorities including the pipeline and ensuring successful launch of new products and the integration of tesaro completion of the consumer jv and disposal of the nutrition business and with that i ll hand over to luke thanks iain good morning and good afternoon in pharma and vaccines our focus on improved commercial execution continues we ve had a good start to the year and overall our growth this year will clearly be impacted by the launch of generic advair we are seeing our new products perform strongly respiratory sales were up 25 at constant exchange rates pleasingly benylsta continues to grow at double digit rates and bexsero achieved sales of gbp156 million up 14 at constant exchange rates i ll now go into more detail on some of our newer products starting in respiratory trelegy continues to do well with sales of gbp87 million in q1 globally launches have had a good start and we now have the only once daily triple therapy for copd in 30 countries around the world 2019 will be an important year for trelegy as we are executing our launch strategy in japan and expect to have approval and launch in china later in the year we re also looking forward to data from the captain study which if successful could enable us to reach patients with asthma that struggle to breathe in asthma biologics nucala remains the market leader in total sales and continues to grow quarter over quarter on past results calls we signaled that we needed to improve commercial execution with nucala there s more work to do but we re seeing some encouraging signs as you can see from this chart it looks at an estimated new patient starts across both retail and non retail segments and we now have closed the gap with inaudible in new patients and are now back to a one to one position versus our closest competitor we track several measures but new patient starts remain a key target because the il5 class as a whole can grow a lot more we estimate that out of the 340 severe eos patients eligible for a biologic in the us less than 25 have received one today finally we re excited about the opportunity to provide the convenience of home administration later this year next slide please i also wanted to highlight zejula a market leading parp inhibitor for recurrent maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer in the us in q1 gsk reported sales of gbp42 million but when factoring in q1 sales prior to the acquisition sales were at gbp56 million our share of the second line maintenance for ovarian cancer is stable and we re looking to improve our competitive focus as we integrate our commercial operations zejula is now approved in 35 countries globally with an established presence in the us germany the uk and italy our teams are now ph establishing france and spain and we plan to launch with a partner in hong kong before the end of the year parps remain an important option for ovarian cancer patients and we continue to believe the class is underappreciated as we ve mentioned before evidence suggests that there is a significant opportunity to help many more patients than those with the gbrca mutation including those who are hiv positive and potentially all comers in the first line maintenance setting linked to this we look forward to getting the prima data which will give us more information about this opportunity by the end of the year moving on we re very pleased by the strong execution of shingrix as we continue to expand and accelerate capacity to deliver the significant step up in doses in 2019 versus 2018 that we had previously indicated to you in the us where demand remains high we re seeing more than 75 of individuals who received their first dose of shingrix complete the two dose series in terms of who is getting vaccinated it s consistent we continue to see more than one third of individuals aged under 65 and also more than one third of those receiving shingrix have previously been vaccinated with the competitor and our capacity expansions remain on track and now i ll hand over to david david redfern chief strategy officer thanks luke good afternoon good morning everyone during q1 hiv grew 4 cer to gbp1 1 billion which comprised the dolutegravir portfolio of triumeq tivicay juluca growing at 7 cer offset by the anticipated continued decline of the mature portfolio this was slightly slower growth than in previous quarters due to the significantly larger base of the overall business and the more competitive environment in the us we remain encouraged by the performance of juluca which is continuing to gain share with greater than 2 200 scripts per week and over 1 800 physicians now prescribing giving sales of gbp70 million in the quarter we have seen a pickup in juluca since the publication of the 96 week sword data in october of last year and this is now being further endorsed by the positive 148 week data around 65 of the juluca business continues to be sourced from non dolutegravir combinations we believe this is a good indicator of growing prescriber confidence in two drug regimens which will now be further reinforced by the launch in the us of dovato the us business grew 3 cer with the dolutegravir portfolio growing by 4 offset by the decline in the mature portfolio in a continuation of a trend we have previously flagged we ve seen some switching of the margin of the triumeq business in particular to both juluca and competitor strs and the overall market share of dolutegravir based regimens in the str and core agent market has declined slightly and is now around 26 5 tivicay descovy remains a popular and broadly stable business and through the second half of the quarter we have seen tivicay mb rx improve future growth in the us will come from our two drug regimens juluca and now dovato in 2019 with cabotegravir rilpivirine long acting providing further momentum subject to fda approval from 2020 in europe the dolutegravir volume grew 8 driven by share growth in most markets but the overall hiv business declined 6 in the quarter this was driven by three factors firstly price cuts over the last few months in france spain and italy all these price cuts were government mandated secondly a challenging 2018 comparator which included a one off clawback release on triumeq in q1 last year in italy and thirdly the drag from the mature portfolio we expect the impact from these factors to reduce to some degree as the year goes on in the international region the business continued to grow strongly at 29 cer including good contributions from japan and brazil next slide turning to dovato we are very pleased by the approval by the fda in april and the recent positive opinion granted by the chmp in europe last week we will continue to invest in generating further clinical evidence to support dovato including in broader patient populations this will include gemini 96 week data which we expect to be available over the summer and if positive should help to reinforce confidence in the durability and resistance barrier of dovato the tango and then subsequently salsa switch studies which we anticipate will enable us to file for a switch indication in the us and also a number of other phase iiib iv studies turning to our long acting injectable cabotegravir rilpivirine we have now filed in the us with the eu submission to come shortly later in the year we will report out the eight week dosing study this is important as it would enable patients to reduce their injections from 12 per year to just six quite an amazing shift if successful from current standard of oral daily oral care with 365 tablets taken per year and finally fostemsavir an important medicine for patients with few treatment options remaining is on track and we continue to anticipate filing by the end of 2019 overall therefore we continue to have confidence in the growth profile of our hiv business with that i will hand back to emma emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much david so as a reminder we ve seen good progress this quarter on our priorities of innovation performance and trust and we are firmly on track with our key areas of focus it s important that we now build on this momentum for the year so we re driving improvements in our operating performance we re progressing our pipeline with a number of major readouts to come and we re working toward a successful integration with pfizer once the consumer jv has completed successfully delivering these priorities over the coming years will provide a clear pathway to the creation of two great businesses one focused on pharma and vaccines the other on consumer health so we are now joined for our q a with hal on the line and also brian and roger and so with that operator the team is now ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you your question and answer session will now begin operator instructions the first question is from the line of keyur parekh of goldman sachs your line is now open please go ahead keyur parekh goldman sachs international analyst good afternoon it s keyur parekh from goldman sachs two questions please one for hal and one for iain hal i noticed there s a slight delay on the timelines for the bcma study in the second line multiple myeloma setting just wondering if you could give us some color around that what s causing this data to go from first half to the second half and then secondly for iain iain as i look at q1 and i look at what s implied for your guidance for the rest of the year it feels like you re implying margin degradation of somewhere in the region of 250 to 300 basis points across the company i realize there are several kind of factors are going to drag margin down but just help us think about kind of is there upside to that margin number where could there be potential for you to take guidance up as you feel more comfortable with the rest of the year thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk well thanks very much keyur so we ll go first to hal and then come over to iain dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d thanks keyur thanks for the question as you know we started a lot of studies to accelerate our anti bcma adc program and i should point out that our timelines for the dreamm 2 monotherapy study in fourth line remains on track and we re expecting to report off the data at the end later this year and file by the end of the year as well as you point out we ve noted a delay in the pilot study in the second line and that was really driven by discussions we were having with the fda and actually decided to modify the protocol to enable us to have more patients and a more robust understanding of the dose response and dose exploration and to enable us to design the dreamm 7 and 8 studies optimally that resulted in increasing number of patients and so that s going to delay the readout but importantly this is not driven by any adverse safety signals in the studies just to remove any concern of that and i should also point out that we re aggressively exploring options to make up for this delay in the dose exploration so that it ll have hopefully less impact on the ultimate approval date emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much hal and so iain following on from our strong start what about any comments on keyur s question on the guidance iain mackay chief financial officer keyur thanks for your question in terms of key influences on outlook for the whole year really no significant change from the guidance we gave at the fourth quarter key influences on it keyur the full integration of tesaro and with that a significant step up in r d expenditure specifically in that area more broadly in r d continuing to invest behind our priority programs across the pipeline another key feature which we still haven t seen the full impact of it playing through in fact really only the initial is the advair genericization and the impact obviously of mylan but also our own the introduction of our own generic advair in that regard and then one other feature which we have mentioned that sits within the first quarter which is somewhat flattering to the operating margin are a couple of inventory adjustments within the vaccines business specifically which would most definitely have an impact on the vaccines operating margin but also more broadly for the group so more broadly within that range of down 5 to 9 notwithstanding a really strong performance from shingrix in the quarter guidance for the moment early as it is very much as it is and it goes without saying hopefully that as the year progresses we ll keep you posted on how we see those margins developing emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much next question please operator next question is from the line of jo walton of credit suisse your line is open please go ahead johannah walton credit suisse securities usa llc analyst thank you my questions are along the same lines i wonder as a new cfo coming in from another industry whether you could give us your initial thoughts on the particularly the cost structures that you see you have highlighted tight cost control going forward it s always interesting to hear another person s views of costs in this industry and the second question going back to generic advair if we look at the prescription numbers it does look as if there may be some capacity constraints with the generic because the generic isn t appearing to gain any more share and the share is stabilizing with yourself and your authorized generic i wonder if you could just tell us what you think is happening in the market because maybe you ve got a better sense of that than we have emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk so hi jo so just firstly on the advair generic i think and then i will come back to iain to speak for his first impressions but it is early days i don t think it s for us to comment on the supply of mylan but at the moment we think we are completely where we would expect and there s no change to the outlook that we ve previously shared in terms of our expectations for advair overall in 2020 but iain would you like to comment on iain mackay chief financial officer comment on costs emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk first impressions iain mackay chief financial officer first impressions as you quite rightly pointed out jo there are both dissimilarities and similarities across the two sectors believe it or not i think initial observations there are a number of important i shan t call them restructurings but refocusing of energy within the firm that i m seeing the early indications of and that is the work that luke and the team is doing across pharma commercial in terms of really orientating the commercial organization to the key priorities around product launch and building revenues and through that process seeing some reorganization from that very effective cost control in that regard equally as we ve talked about before the work that hal is doing in the r d organization about which we talked about in some detail at the midpoint last year also is focused on improving the overall effectiveness but also the efficiency of the r d organization so what i see initially is a strong focus on cost management across the organization whether it s in the sg a areas whether it s specifically within r d whether it s within the supply chain across vaccines pharma and very notably within the consumer the consumer healthcare space as well so i think my first impression is there s a very strong focus on improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness and margins of the organization with a broad range of activities across really every line and cost category across the p l so in summary favorable emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of graham parry of bank of america ml your line is open please go ahead graham parry merrill lynch international uk analyst great thanks for taking our questions first question is on hiv so we start to see some formularies such as express scripts national formularies start to add hiv to its exclusion list this year gsk drugs are still on formulary can you run through whether gsk has had to offer any increased rebates to keep the portfolio there and if you expect that to increase price pressure over time and then secondly on the vaccines margin of 40 i think you talked about what the 2q should look like but it would be helpful if you could just quantify and strip out both the rebate benefit to shingrix and the phasing benefits across the portfolio so we can understand what the right underlying and ongoing level for both shingrix and the rest of the portfolio would be as we re trying to calculate the rest of the year thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much graham so first to david knowing that we ve never given detailed updates on our commercial relationships but first to david and then iain perhaps on the vaccines margin david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks graham so as you say we do have very strong formulary access for tivicay triumeq and juluca very strong coverage and as i ve said it s pretty stable and we are in the discussions over with dovato having been recently approved with the payers in the us and the initial feedback we ve had is the wacc price which is the lowest integrase str in the market has been favorably received and those discussions are going very well so no real significant change in the dynamic i mean i think the one thing that is going on with the payers is that some of them at least are trying to much more actively manage their formularies to line up with the guidelines and hiv is very guideline driven the guidelines are updated regularly so you see some formularies like esi and others excluding some of the older tenofovir based regimens so that is going on but overall very stable and we have very strong coverage and we re very optimistic about the coverage we re going to get for dovato emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk vaccines iain iain mackay chief financial officer yeah graham on the on the vaccines margin front taking broadly the influence of both rebating and inventory adjustments across that portfolio for the quarter it contributed positively about five points to the margin in the quarter together and in total in sterling terms represented about gbp70 million in total so when you when you think about the guidance we provided previously looking out to 2020 that gives you a margin broadly consistent with where we would expect the vaccines business to be in 2020 that is not to say that we would expect necessarily the vaccines business to be at that level for the remainder of this year but that is the impact and that rebating was specific to shingrix and then inventory adjustments were across a broader range of products within the portfolio emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of tim anderson of wolfe research your line is open please go ahead timothy anderson wolfe research llc analyst thank you i have a question on consensus modeling for tivicay and triumeq according to the data that you guys collect consensus really has those two franchises as pretty much flat over a five year window on a global basis but if i look at script trends at least in the us it shows some pretty stiff competition from gilead so i m hoping you can give us some perspective on whether you think consensus modeling again for tivicay and triumeq over something like a five year window is right second question is just if you could disclose emerging market performance in the quarter including china performance thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk okay thanks very much tim so i ll come to david in just a moment to comment a bit on shares and outlook in hiv knowing that we never comment on the specifics of consensus and in terms of emerging markets we were up 6 we don t explicitly disclose on china though we re happy i m sure luke will be happy to give some comments later if anyone wants to ask on what our plans are in our china business but david do you want to just comment on david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks tim so we re not going to comment specifically as emma says on consensus but i ll just make a few remarks i mean firstly obviously hiv is a competitive marketplace but overall actually i think we traded during q1 very much in line with our expectations there has been some switching at the margin as i said in my remarks particularly on triumeq but overall we re running at certainly through the quarter at about 32 000 to 33 000 scripts so relatively stable what is true is that going forward in the us we see the vast majority of the growth coming now from our two drug regimens so juluca initially but hopefully now also dovato and then from next year subject to approval cabotegravir so that is where the growth will come from and to some degree there will be some cannibalization of tivicay and triumeq in the us particularly probably triumeq into the two drug regimes and that will be fine so that is where the growth will come from outside the us it will be more broadly based including tivicay and triumeq emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks david next question please operator next question is from the line of peter welford of jefferies your line is open please go ahead peter welford jefferies international ltd analyst thanks i ve got my customary two questions so firstly on nucala i wonder if you can just comment there in regards to the trends i guess you re seeing now starting to evolve perhaps in the marketplace obviously a new competitor entering and also perhaps new auto administration reaching the market before yours and so how do you sort of think we should think about that product for the remainder of the year given i think some prior sort of more cautious commentary you ve given perhaps ahead of this quarter and then secondly just on bcma inaudible just with regards to the multiple myeloma combo trial with the inaudible that you ve initiated just would love to hear the thinking behind that trial given obviously there s been a number of setbacks with the pd 1s in this indication and also whether or not you re confident manufacturing for that is ready to be able to file by year end when you get the data from the fourth line trial thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk okay luke and then over to hal luke miels president global pharmaceuticals yeah thank you for the question so i mean i think with nucala it s been very much back to basics with us we ve worked very hard to establish a clear positioning in the market we ve focused on productivity of the sales force the medical teams and i think you re starting to see the benefits of that flowing through in terms of the broader dynamics i mean again we i think we re holding our own dupilumab seems to be taking the bulk of its business from inaudible not from the il 5 class and i think that there s no signs of that shifting at this point in terms of and also our expansion beyond the us i think we re doing quite well i think we have a better understanding of the patient profile and the true size of the patient pool in countries in europe and we re doing very well with around 70 market share in japan in terms of the 38 autoinjector i mean it s very very interesting if you look at perception mapping around nucala historically there we were able to work on the efficacy profile we were able to work on the mechanism all of these components but obviously one of the challenges that we had that was difficult to move with what we have available today is this perception around dosing frequency so the opportunity for the autoinjector provides another option for patients and physicians so really they have the choice whether they want to dose every four weeks in the office or write a script and enable those patients to subsequently dose at home so it s an attractive option for us we re very much focused on the launch we expect approval in the second half of the year in the us and europe emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks luke hal dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d yeah thank you for the questions first of all yeah we will have the data to review by end of year and there won t be any concerns really from a manufacturing perspective in terms of filing the fourth line data so in the second part of your question in terms of the pd 1 combination trial it s important to point out actually that the bcma adc really has multiple mechanisms it not only inhibits the bcma signaling which is important for plasma cell survival and obviously the toxin conjugate the adc component gives it enormous potential for destroying the plasma cells as well but the antibodies afucosylated which also gives an immune component so a very enhanced adcc and lastly what we observed preclinically is that there s a there s a significant immune component to this therapy that may be due to the adc or maybe even to the adcc but we see preclinically a very interesting immune response that we think will be synergistic with pd 1 you re right to point out that previous trials with pembro haven t been successful in fact i think taught us a lesson about how to think about pd 1 inhibition in diseases in particular myeloma and we re going to leverage that finding where there sometimes is an early hazard that one needs to progress past in order to see the full benefit as you can see now with the longer term follow up so we think based on the mechanism and based on some preclinical data we think that this is a smart risk to take and we ll see what the data shows emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thank you hal next question please operator next question is from the line of steve scala of cowen your line is open please go ahead steve scala cowen and company llc analyst thank you in 2015 the company provided six or seven pieces of 2015 to 20 guidance iain i m just wondering if you have embraced all seven or if you are revising any and just briefly if you will allow me pharma was low single digit ex vaccines vaccines was mid to high single digit but that now looks light respiratory at 2015 levels that looks light consumer low to mid single digit that looks aggressive total company low to mid single digit eps mid single digit tax rate increased two to three percentage points over the next three to five years and if i missed any please reflect on those as well thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk iain iain mackay chief financial officer steve that was a fairly kick ass question thank you look i think from where from where i sit somebody that started my job 30 days ago what i am particularly focused on is how we close out the remainder of 2019 and build on the progress that we made in the first quarter i think at the fourth quarter we talked about the 2019 guidance and how that took us through to 2020 and in that regard the guidance that we updated then and that we ve reaffirmed today i think is hopefully suitable guidance for you to think about how the pharma as a whole progresses through 2019 and then sets up for 2020 clearly the composition of the business is changing somewhat we re going into a jv subject to approvals with consumer health later this year which will have an impact obviously in terms of how brian and the team perform in that regard and obviously we ve done the transaction in tesaro which clearly changes the shape somewhat of pharma and obviously there s a couple of disposals going on as well so i think the shape the shape of the organization is changing so if i would dare to suggest a way of thinking about the guidance is how we ve updated at the end of last year how we ve updated today or rather reaffirmed around that with a strong focus on execution in 2019 and setting yourself up for 2020 emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of laura sutcliffe of ubs your line is open please go ahead laura sutcliffe ubs ltd analyst hello thanks for taking my questions obviously shingrix is doing very well i noticed you have killed your universal flu vaccine project though so could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you re excited about in the vaccines pipeline what they might be coming up after shingrix and secondly i m going to ask the question that emma mentioned about your ambitions in china could you maybe speak a little bit about that too outside of consumer health thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk of course so we ll come to luke in a moment on china but since we have roger connor also in the room who s been working not only on the improvements in our supply in shingrix but is also responsible for the r d organization there so do you want to comment on the pipeline perhaps roger connor president global vaccines yeah will do listen thank you very much for the question you ll notice that there were two assets in our vaccine pipeline that we have removed this quarter first of all not a concern these are not priority assets just maybe to walk through the assets in particular one was as you mentioned the universal flu asset which is a partnered asset in phase i and ii that we have stopped following an interim data analysis just to emphasize we re still very much committed to flu development and we are looking at the early stages of our pipeline looking at alternative approaches in the universal flu space just for information the other asset that we stopped was a next generation option for prevention of pneumococcal disease we were looking at new technologies there again not viable to go forward again these are not priority assets for us and really allow us to stay focused on our priority assets in our pipeline and maybe i ll just mention two very quickly one is our rsv portfolio i m very excited about this we have in respiratory syncytial virus three different vaccines in development as you as you ll know i m sure rsv is the single biggest cause of hospitalization in infants under one and we have three vaccines in development one for pediatric one for maternal and one for older adults and we look at that portfolio where actually we think there is a real potential for first on best in class vaccines within that portfolio and you may have seen already that our older adult and maternal vaccine in rsv they both have received a prioritized fast track designation from the fda so lots going on in rsv for us and an exciting area on our older adult i should just emphasize as well that vaccine will use to ca modulin system as our shingrix vaccine which proved very effective there and just on another asset in the pipeline that we are looking at very closely in prioritizing is copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease again this vaccine will use our adjuvant system again it ll be a therapeutic vaccine and we re looking to see how do we exploit the adjuvant technology to go into this therapeutic space and on copd in particular this is the first vaccine against copd which is looking to really address exacerbation with and disease progression exacerbations are caused by are associated with let s say bacterial presence and we feel that a vaccine addressing those bacteria could have a big impact so exciting times in the pipeline but those are just two of the priority assets we have emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks roger so luke china luke miels president global pharmaceuticals sure thanks laura so i mean we remain very positive about china i think in contrast to a number of peers we have a very concentrated portfolio there and so when we look at the opportunities i think in in the immediate products that we have today the first is seretide i think it s probably well known to everyone that copd is significantly undertreated even when it is diagnosed in china so we see that as a major opportunity to expand the usage of that product there cervarix we re still in the early days of the introduction there we have around a third of the patients who are taking hpv who are vaccinated with hpv and then linked to that is the opportunity to broaden the vaccines portfolio within china and then underlying all of this is really just working very hard on our commercial and medical execution in country and then ultimately working hard in partnership with hal and his team to accelerate the introduction of pipeline assets such as bcma and hep b into china emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks luke i mean in the end obviously we are starting for the reasons you re all familiar with from a lower base that gives us opportunity for growth in arguably one of the most exciting markets at the moment not least because of deregulation that s going on around innovation as luke has alluded to and we sat on slightly less exposure relatively in terms of the pricing around branded generics so more to come there and we ll see where the shingrix approval goes in due course okay next question please operator next question is from the line of richard parkes of deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead richard parkes deutsche bank ag analyst hi thank you very much for taking my questions first one for iain on free cash flow and the balance sheet you called out and you have done previously a step down in free cash flow generation this year due to generic advair but just wondered if you could give us some kind of steer on where it now might fall out in terms of dividend cover this year and how you re feeling about what flexibility there is still in the balance sheet to do business development and maybe talk about what the path is to deleveraging the balance sheet and maybe get more aggressive there in terms of business development that s the first question then secondly on the hiv franchise obviously european sales saw a decline and i think you flagged the price reductions i m just wondering how you expect that to play out for the full year can hiv in europe still grow this year and are you seeing any impact from tegravir launches in that number thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk so david why don t we go to you first just comment on hiv and then we ll come back to iain no we don t guide on cash flow in the year but i will come back to iain on your other broader finance questions david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks richard so hiv in europe the volume actually grew very strongly dolutegravir volume up 8 with some very good performances in france spain and italy and actually particularly pleased about how juluca has started in france but as i said there was some government mandated price cuts in a few markets so for example in france the fifth anniversary from your launch you often have to take a price cut and that was the case with tivicay so these won t happen every year but it s normal part of life in europe which impacted the quarter and will obviously have an impact across the year and then there was some comparative there was a one off comparative in italy so the impact will dissipate during the year but it won t totally go but overall pretty pleased with the performance i mean in terms of the competition it is obviously heating up in europe particularly in germany which is the markets are all very different in europe germany is probably the most like the us in the sense it s a free market for pricing and also the most favorable to strs and we have seen some switching at the margin there to the competition but everywhere else we ve been growing market share and we re quite pleased emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks david so over to iain and just in terms of the bd appetite point i will say we are largely focused on digesting exactly the rather significant number of deals we have in hands but iain comments overall iain mackay chief financial officer yeah richard thanks for the question clearly strong focus in terms of working capital management cash flow generation across the company with that embedded in everybody s goals and objectives just talking about the full year we talked obviously last year very good year from a cash flow perspective with gbp5 7 billion for the full year what we talked about at the fourth quarter was the expectation a couple of things one lower profitability in line with the guidance for the full year other things kicking in the full impact of advair which we would expect to see coming through over the next quarter or so continued to step up r d and the investment behind our priorities in that pipeline an important factor another thing building on the announcement around the middle of ph 2000 july with respect to restructuring we ll see a bigger impact of restructuring in 2019 so those factors as we said at the end of the year we d expect to see cash generation somewhat lower than was the case in 2018 but nonetheless a very very strong focus in that area guidance today on the dividend obviously no change reaffirmed expectations around the gbp0 80 per share for the full year 2019 and in terms of thinking about capital allocation more broadly and emma talked about really focusing on implementing executing the transactions that we ve got in the pipeline now and realizing value from those transactions clearly one of those the disposition of the nutrition business in india to unilever will generate significant cash flow as the as that deal closes and will go largely to improving overall balance sheet capacity and when we think about that capacity it s around supporting the pipeline returns to shareholders through the dividend and this continued aspect of looking for business development that contributes to strengthening the long term future of the firm subject obviously to pretty strict return criteria and structuring within those transactions but it would not be an understatement to say that there is very very sharp focus across the firm on cash generation emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk yeah i certainly confirm that and just in terms of what the pathway is i ll just remind everybody that in we re obviously very excited about getting to the close subject to necessary approvals of the consumer deal we re then going to be focused on a successful integration which we are confident we can deliver and then up to three years after close we do intend to separate these companies and that will create the reset of the capital structures for both businesses which then creates a whole new level of capacity for that pharma and vaccines company focused on the science of immunology to technology and genetics to both invest in further growth organically and inorganically and deliver returns to shareholders thank you and next question please operator yeah the next question is from the line of simon baker of redburn your line is open please go ahead simon baker redburn partners llp analyst thank you for taking my two questions firstly just continue really off on richard s question on free cash flow perhaps i could broaden out a little for iain to get your perspectives at this admittedly early stage on where free cash flow conversion is notwithstanding the one off effects in the quarter and where you think it could and should be in the coming years and then secondly a question for hal there was a report out from the iqvia institute last week suggesting the potential impact of various new technologies on r d productivity given that the history of r d is littered with technologies which have over promised and under delivered it d be very interesting to get your perspectives on what you think are the principal technological drivers of increased r d productivity over the coming years thanks so much emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk fantastic so we ll come to iain first and then come over to hal on the phone knowing that again he will be giving you an update on the this and including that question i think at q2 but first of all iain any further comments you want to make on cash flow iain mackay chief financial officer not a great deal just to emphasize the focus around working capital management across the organization as a whole and looking broadly across the balance sheet and the wider portfolio in terms of opportunity to create monetization opportunities where returns are presently below hurdle rates that we ve set and that s a piece of work that we do across each of the businesses on an ongoing basis the focus is there really nothing more precise on the guidance in that regard emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain so hal new technologies dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d thanks for the question simon i think there s no question that the r d organizations across pharma can benefit from improvements in productivity and i would say the focus for us is being driven by the observation that only about one in 10 molecules that enter the clinic actually ends up becoming a medicine and helping patients and we re pretty focused on seeing if we can increase that substantially and the three technologies that we have identified as that we believe will improve this dramatically potentially is human genetics and with the reduction in the cost of sequencing as well as the number of people and patients who have been signing up for various sequencing opportunities such as 23andme where we have now millions of patients who ve donated their genetic information to help us understand better targets we think it s going to be a very important technology in addition functional genomics which is essentially taking that genetic data and being able to understand what does it really mean what is the structural variance telling us about human disease could also enable us to find much much better targets and given how massive these datasets can become when you do all these technologies we really do believe that machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to these highly dimensional datasets can unravel the biology in a pretty profound way and all three of these are growing in sophistication and i ll be talking a lot more about this at q2 but we ve already started seeing some interesting targets that were never identified previously and we think that because they re driven really by using the human as the model organism if you will using human genetics and functional genomics we think this could have a significant impact on our probability of success and therefore our productivity but more on that in q2 emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much hal and with that i think we ve come now to the end of the call so i d like to say thank you to everybody for joining good to hear your voices and we look forward to catching up soon thanks bye duration 62 minutes call participants sarah elton farr head of global investor relations emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive

in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec i ll now turn the call over to willy willy walker chairman and chief executive officer thank you kelsey and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning to review our performance for the first quarter of 2019 our strongest q1 financial results to date we had a fantastic start to the year driven by consistent execution by our team continued benefits from our strategic growth initiatives and a supportive macroeconomic environment during 2018 we invested considerable energy and capital to expand our mortgage banking and property sales platforms these investments are reflected in first quarter 2019 revenues 187 million up 27 from first quarter last year as shown on slide three strong top line growth coupled with continued expense management and increased economies of scale and our servicing platform generated diluted earnings per share of 1 39 a 22 increase over q1 2018 steve will dive into our financial performance in more details in a bit but one of the areas he will highlight are the cash generating components of our business model and their dramatic growth in the first quarter pushing adjusted ebitda to over 60 million for the first time ever to a record 67 million up 28 over q1 of last year our first quarter financial performance is emblematic of how we have grown walker dunlop by establishing long term highly ambitious goals investing in people systems and technology to achieve those goals and then executing daily for our clients the commercial real estate industry was very active during the first quarter and our team took advantage of the market opportunity by generating total transaction volume of 5 9 billion a 23 increase year over year the breakout of our quarterly total transaction volume is shown on slide four total mortgage banking volume was up 16 to 5 2 billion led by fannie mae originations of 2 billion up 60 from the first quarter of 2018 our freddie mac originations were also strong 1 6 billion a 19 increase from q1 2018 82 of our total fannie and freddie volume was fixed rate reflecting borrower s desire to lock in long term financing as rates rallied in the quarter due to slower global economic growth and the dovish stance taken by the federal reserve with regard to future rate increases with historically high amounts of capital focused on investing in commercial real estate and the rallying rates during q1 acquisition activity was very robust driving walker dunlop s q1 multi family property sales volume to nearly 700 million up 106 from last year we made significant investments in property sales teams in boston dallas and los angeles last year and with those teams fully integrated we expect to see continued year over year growth in our property sales volume for the remainder of the year as anticipated and discussed in our last earnings call our hud originations were down year over year to 178 million due to the government shutdown that lasted nearly all of january brokered debt originations of 1 4 billion was a healthy start to the year but down 9 from q1 of 2018 we expect to see year over year growth in debt brokerage due to the significant investments we have made to add mortgage bankers with strong client relationships across the country our principal lending and investing volume which includes lending activities through our joint venture with blackstone loans we originate on our balance sheet and loans we originate for separate accounts managed by our fund management platform jcr capital totaled 76 million in the first quarter this was a slow start to the year but as our financial results this quarter show the robust origination volume in q4 of last year generated meaningful interest income in the first quarter we will continue to use our balance sheet for selective lending opportunities to assist our borrowers and maintain our focus on deploying as much capital as possible in our blackstone joint venture and separate accounts we manage we ended the quarter with 1 4 billion of assets under management and jcr capital is currently marketing its fifth fund which will add new capital strategies for our bankers and brokers to sell as you can see on slide five the sustained growth in our mortgage origination business has produced dramatic growth in our loan servicing portfolio which has increased on average 10 billion per year every year over the past five years to 88 billion today with a weighted average servicing fee of 24 basis points and a weighted average life of 9 8 years our servicing portfolio continues to gain value at a rapid pace servicing income along with other non transaction related revenue streams such as interest income totaled 44 of revenues in q1 of this year these cash revenues are earned regardless of our level of transaction activity in a given quarter and make our business model exceptionally durable i ll now turn the call over to steve to discuss our q1 financial performance in more details steve steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you willy and good morning everyone our team kicked off 2019 with a very strong first quarter delivery in revenue and adjusted ebitda growth in excess of 25 our financial results were powered by a great quarter of agency originations the continued growth in our servicing portfolio and its related revenues and the deployment of capital to our balance sheet lending program our key metrics during the quarter demonstrate just how good a start to the year this was q1 eps of 1 39 was up from 1 14 last year an increase of 22 adjusted ebitda was 67 million for the quarter a record and nearly 28 higher than q1 2018 as you can see on slide six operating margin was 30 and return on equity was 20 both in the mid to upper end of our target ranges finally gain on sale margin was 190 basis points well above our target range and slightly better than first quarter of last year let me highlight some of the important drivers of our q1 results total mortgage banking originations of 5 2 billion included 3 7 billion of agency lending volume that compared to 2 9 billion in q1 2018 the increase in agency volumes contributed to the 21 year over year increase in mortgage banking gains benefiting each of our key metrics in particular the high volume of fannie mae business in the quarter pushed the overall gain on sale margin to 190 basis points well above the target range of 150 basis points to 170 basis points this out performance was driven almost entirely by business mix as the overall margins on our various origination types was little changed from what we saw in the fourth quarter while we love doing 38 of our mortgage banking volume with fannie mae this weighting is higher than our recent historical average and we fully expect that we will do more freddie and brokered business in the coming quarters as a result we are maintaining our gain on sale margin forecast range of 150 basis points to 170 basis points our 30 operating margin was unchanged from the first quarter of last year reflecting both the increase in revenue and the increase in expenses from the investments we made in 2018 acquiring jcr and icap and adding mortgage bankers and property sales brokers to the platform in addition the increase in transaction volumes year over year has led to increases in both commission and bonus compensation expense this quarter compared to q1 of last year personnel as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 37 in q1 2018 to 38 in q1 2019 largely due to the aforementioned increases in variable compensation during the quarter we acquired a small technology company that has developed a variety of tools to automate components of the loan underwriting process this team of talented software engineers and data scientists will help us drive efficiencies and speed to market not just in our loan underwriting but in our loan origination and servicing operations as well we are super excited about the capabilities this team brings to our company and look forward to telling you more about what we were up to in the future this quarter s expenses include 2 7 million of provision for credit losses compared to a benefit in the prior year of 500 000 during the quarter we booked specific provisions for two loans one a 21 million student housing deal in our fannie mae at risk portfolio and the second a 14 7 million loan on a memory care facility in our interim portfolio we don t believe these two loans represent a new trend or signal a turn in credit but rather are isolated instances in what otherwise remains a benign credit environment as there are no other delinquent loans in our at risk or interim portfolios at this time in addition during the quarter the average ltv and debt service coverage ratio for new loans made was 65 and 1 39 times consistent with what we have seen for the past few years and still at levels we are very comfortable lending our effective tax rate during the quarter was 21 compared to 16 in the first quarter of last year as we have previously mentioned for the last few years we have recognized additional tax benefits with divesting of employee stock grants due to the appreciation in the share price from the date of grant to the date of vest most of this benefit is recognized in the first quarter as that is when the majority of our employee stock grants vest this year that benefit amounted to approximately 0 11 per share compared to 0 13 cents last year and is the primary reason this quarter s effective tax rate is only 21 going forward our effective tax rate for future quarters should be somewhere between 26 and 27 turning to slide seven adjusted ebitda achieved record 66 7 million this quarter an increase of 28 over last year primarily driven by increases in origination fees servicing fees and interest income the servicing portfolio grew to just shy of 88 billion an increase of 16 over the year ago quarter interest income grew by 278 as decreases in agency warehouse interest income from an inverted yield curve were more than offset by increases in interest on escrow deposits investments in pledge securities and interim loans we ended the quarter with 110 million of cash on the balance sheet with another 255 million of capital supporting our interim loan portfolio the refinance and upsize of our term loan b in november of last year allowed us to increase our principal lending business through the use of our balance sheet on a short term basis as we discussed last quarter our interim loan portfolio grew to nearly 500 million at the end of the year with an average remaining maturity of eight months the portfolio now sits at just over 470 million based on pay downs during the quarter we expect to continue recycling capital in this portfolio to deepen the relationship with our customers and provide additional opportunities for permanent financing in the future our strong cash position and financial results also support our quarterly dividend payment yesterday our board of directors authorized a dividend of 0 30 per share payable to common shareholders of record on may 17 2019 representing the payout ratio of only 20 of net income we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2019 these results once again demonstrate the power of our unique business model which coupled to the strong balance sheet with a growing servicing portfolio providing us with the ongoing ability to both invest in our future and return capital to shareholders while also earning above market returns on that capital i d like to thank you all for joining us this morning and i ll now turn the call back over to willy willy walker chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve housing finance reform became a topic of discussion on capitol hill almost immediately after fannie mae and freddie mac were taken into conservatorship in september of 2008 during the great financial crisis it is important to remember that walker dunlop acquired column guaranteed from credit suisse four months after fannie and freddie were placed into conservatorship we made that bet understanding the vital role that gses play in the us housing finance market and we benefited tremendously from that investment we also acquired cwcapital from fortress investment group in 2012 after the republicans took control of the house of representatives and began calling for an end to fannie and freddie and similar to the column acquisition the acquisition of cwcapital was widely beneficial to our company and shareholder returns we have made large strategic acquisitions in the agency lending space that have benefited us tremendously due to our understanding of the economics and politics surrounding the gses we are very supportive of many of the ideas and initiatives being discussed by both the trump administration and senate banking committee with regard to housing finance reform the white house recently released a presidential executive order that calls for an end to the conservatorship of the gses senator mike crapo chairman of the senate banking committee released an outline of the legislation his committee is hoping to draft and pass that calls for an end to conservatorship and the potential privatization of fannie mae and freddie mac s multifamily businesses we are encouraged by these efforts to end conservatorship and either create a multi guarantor model or turn fannie mae and freddie mac into utility light public companies with an established rate of return and significant regulatory oversight while there will be hearings proposals and plenty of regulatory and legislative ideas themes and initiatives between now and any ultimate administrative or legislative reform we are confident that fannie and freddie s multifamily businesses will endure due to their negligible losses during the great financial crisis their core business models which placed private capital ahead of public capital and their mandates and missions of providing financing for the largest and fastest growing source of affordable housing in america apartments our current outlook for the remainder of the year is positive given the macroeconomic fundamentals that are driving continued investor appetite in commercial real estate recent economic forecasts for 2019 gdp growth in the low 2 range with a core inflation rate near the fed s target of 2 and a sustained low level of unemployment if wages and oil don t spike the fed should remain on the sidelines with regard to further rate hikes leaving short and long term rates at very attractive levels for commercial real estate investment household formation should continue around 1 million households per year yet as we have discussed before the dearth of new entry level single family housing is pushing the value of existing entry level single family housing higher and higher and so while the economy continues to expand and many americans would normally be looking to move from multi family housing to owning a single family home there is limited new supply which is making the existing housing stock more and more expensive as shown on slide eight the average price of existing single family inventory has steadily risen from 267 000 in 2015 to 299 000 in 2018 a 12 increase while the supply of existing homes has decreased by 14 over that time this phenomena is keeping renters renting and forcing them to not only start households in multi family housing but start families there to further this point the us homeownership rate dropped in the first quarter of 2019 for the first time in two years by 60 basis points to 64 2 reversing a two year trend of upward movement the fact that this downward shift occurred in a quarter that saw declines in 30 year mortgage rates reflects the significant barriers to homeownership that first time homebuyers are currently facing this macro trend will support continued strength in the financial performance of multifamily assets and the loans we have on them 2 to 3 gdp growth and the 10 year treasury between ph 250 and 3 has been an extremely strong macroeconomic environment for the dramatic growth in commercial real estate since the great financial crisis and with those same economic conditions looking likely for the foreseeable future we see continued strength a survey of investors by preqin at the end of 2018 revealed that 81 of investors expect that their capital commitments to real estate over the next 12 months will either remain the same or increase as compared with the previous 12 months global investors continue to find opportunities in the commercial real estate sector particularly in the united states that offer attractive returns relative to other asset classes based on preqin s real estate index shown on slide nine north america focused real estate funds have outperformed all other regions since 2011 at the end of march a record 327 billion of capital sat in real estate private equity funds and over 65 of that capital or 213 billion is targeted toward north america all of these macroeconomic trends create a very positive operating environment for our business as we enter the second quarter we operate in an incredibly competitive market yet walker dunlop is in the unique position of competing head to head with global firms while still being a small entrepreneurial company with nimble and efficient operations it is that magical combination of big company capabilities with the touch and feel of a small family company that differentiates us from the competition w d was recently ranked as the sixth best workplace in the financial services industry by fortune magazine sixth among the thousands of financial services companies across the country it is our unique corporate culture that centers around our customer service that sets us apart from the competition and allows us to continue to attract the very best professionals in our industry i would like to thank all my colleagues at walker dunlop for a great start to 2019 and as always thank our shareholders for your investment and trust in walker dunlop i will now ask catherine to open the line for any questions questions and answers operator the floor is now opened for questions operator instructions thank you our first question is coming from steve delaney with jmp securities your line is now open steve delaney jmp securities analyst thank you congratulations on the strong start to 2019 willy if i could start with you we ve been watching monthly the gse delivery reports the new business reports and quite a reversal in 2019 versus 2018 in terms of fannie mae s aggressiveness on a relative basis where we re showing them up 26 over freddie mac in the first quarter any comments there as to what s going on what s different this year than last year between the two and should we think about in terms of the mix more fannie and more fixed as you showed in your slide deck certainly is positive for the overall margins thank you willy walker chairman and chief executive officer good morning steve and thanks for joining us i wouldn t go out too much into it steve as you know very well fannie and freddie both if you will wax and wane quarter by quarter as it relates to their client base their partners with companies like walker dunlop general pipelines and if one tends to get too much ahead of the other then the other kind of gets aggressive and gets back up and catches up to them and so you know as you ve seen for many many years it s quarter to quarter there are variations but by the end of the year they both sort of end up in the same spot so i wouldn t as it relates to overall annual volumes which is what we re very focused on i wouldn t read too much into it with all that said as you know last year we were fannie s second largest partner and we ve been their largest partner for four of the last six years we have a very strong partnership with them and we also have great clients who come to walker dunlop for that execution and so it was a great quarter and we expect to continue to do a big volume of fannie mae for the rest of the year steve delaney jmp securities analyst thanks and a lot of comments this morning this quarter about interest income obviously with the fed hikes last year escrows kicking in more but that s not something as far as the on balance sheet loans et cetera that you ve really emphasized in the past obviously it s recurring has some nice features is that something that you expect to continue to grow and would you consider acquiring additional capital to build a larger on balance sheet loan portfolio thanks willy walker chairman and chief executive officer yes steve i think historically we ve used balance sheet i would say more opportunistically we do as you well know generate a lot of capital through operations and we ve invested that in both growing the business through m a as well as allocating some of that capital to the on balance sheet portfolio i wouldn t anticipate any change in strategy there i think we still view that as a way for us to deepen the relationship with the customer you know we re getting the good return off the capital we re deploying there and then we re obviously hoping to do agency execution on the back end on all of those loans once they are ready for permanent financing steve delaney jmp securities analyst got it so still more of a strategic synergy thing than sort of a separate capital allocation strategy it sounds like okay thanks and steve since i have you can you give us an update on producer headcount currently and in terms of your business plan for 2019 do you have a specific goal for producer growth steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think as we ve put out there in the past i think we re looking to grow 10 to 15 on the producer headcount again this year we re continuing to be pretty active on the recruiting front to try to get after that willy walker chairman and chief executive officer i think we re right around 170 multiple speakers 168 steve delaney jmp securities analyst 168 okay great okay thank you gentlemen appreciate the comments operator operator instructions our next question is coming from jade rahmani with kbw your line is now open jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much in terms of the strategic outlook does the hff pending sale to jll change your thinking lots of talk in the industry about consolidation and potential cross selling of products across platforms and across client bases do you think that walker dunlop would complement a larger platform well and is that something that you and the board have considered willy walker chairman and chief executive officer good morning jade how are you jade rahmani kbw analyst good thanks willy walker chairman and chief executive officer great so i d say first of all to the point about cross selling our q1 numbers i haven t seen everybody report but our q1 numbers are either above or right at the very fastest growing numbers for our competitive set so we clearly have been able to grow dramatically and put up fantastic financial results without having all of those additional cross selling things that many people talk about so i would say that we have continued to grow faster than the competition staying focused on our customers and focused on our core business and as you well know we go up against the largest commercial real estate services firms and the largest commercial banks in the world and we compete very successfully given our focus on our market and the way we go to market so i would just say to you that the hff jll transaction furthers the theme of consolidation in our industry but i d also say that the removal of hff from the landscape as a very client focused to some degree boutique firm like walker dunlop actually creates space for us to continue doing what we re doing and remain very focused on our core business strategy and obviously our growth in numbers sort of speak for themselves as our ability to continue to scale and grow in a highly competitive market on our own so hats off to the hff team for what looks like a fantastic transaction and as you can imagine we re watching the integration of jll hff very closely jade rahmani kbw analyst and in terms of the broader strategic outlook m a opportunities historically as you mentioned walker dunlop has been acquisitive are you seeing a healthy transaction or potential transaction environment for properties that might be complementary and also as we think about risks beyond gse reform just a decline in potentially the gse s market share in multifamily does that change your thinking about the types of assets you might consider acquiring willy walker chairman and chief executive officer yes so as you know we ve been quite acquisitive on the mortgage banking mortgage debt brokerage side over the past couple of years we continue to look for acquisition opportunities in that space and obviously have nothing to report at this time but as you know we re constantly looking i would say as it relates to the core business the macro environment is just extremely healthy right now and what we ve been able to do is build out a loan origination platform that essentially gives us access to deal flow that we can then take and take to various sources of capital so whether it s an agency loan whether it s a hud loan whether it s a life insurance company loan whether it s a cmbs loan whether it s for our blackstone joint venture whether it s for our balance sheet or whether it s for one of the funds that we now manage at jcr capital the business strategy that we outlined five years ago we have executed on which is to gain access to deal flow and then raise capital that we control and then deploy that capital to meet our clients needs so certainly the gse business is a great business we ve created an extremely strong brand and reputation in that space but we also have access to other sources of capital that we both broker to and also control that allows us to basically meet our clients needs regardless of whether the agencies are very active in the market as they were in q1 or less active in the market as steve delaney said previously as they were in some quarters of 2018 steve delaney jmp securities analyst turning to the tech side i think you know in the past you made a tech investment in a inaudible company that or data analytics company and that company was later sold and steve mentioned a small tech company acquisition this quarter to drive efficiencies and servicing are there any hidden sources of value within walker dunlop s servicing portfolio in terms of the data that it generates the number of properties all the touch points the historical performance that could become a source of value in the future by using that data analytically willy walker chairman and chief executive officer so we as steve outlined in his comments the acquisition we made in q1 is very much focused on streamlining our loan underwriting process and we had a presentation to our board yesterday that was absolutely fantastic on taking that technology and implementing it w d that s really a cost focused investment right now to try and make us more efficient in what we do and also allow us to underwrite loans quicker to get responses back to our clients faster all of that then plays into having better insight into the loans that we are underwriting the properties that we re underwriting and using that data to become more insightful into where opportunities lie as well as having data and information that we can share with our customers to make them more insightful about where they re making their investments so i think the broad answer to your question jade is yes very much so the more specific answer to your question as it relates to where we re focused right now is getting that technology implemented and streamlining some of our operations jade rahmani kbw analyst just on the fhfa side beyond whatever happens on gse reform when if it ever happens do you have any thoughts around whether pre emptively calabria might move to curtail the gse s market share at all in multifamily whether it s revisiting the caps through on the quarterly review process or do you have any concerns that particularly fannie mae s resurgence in volumes might draw his attention to that market share willy walker chairman and chief executive officer so i have no ability to figure out what draws director calabria s attention to anything what i do know is what i read in the papers and what i hear from people who have met with him so you may have seen the wall street journal article last week where the director clearly stated that he has no intentions to change the footprints of fannie and freddie in the short term and so he s on record in the wall street journal as saying that the american banker had an article on interview with him as well that i would say was extremely constructive and positive as it relates to how the director is looking at the markets today and we obviously know several people who have been in to meet with the director since he s been in the seat and everything i ve gotten back so far is that he is taking a very measured approach he is taking a long term outlook to his role as being the director of the fhfa and the one other thing that he shared in both the wall street journal article as well as he mentioned anecdotally is that he does not want to get ahead of congress that he understands that congress really wants to play a role here and as such he s looking for a legislative reform before he s looking for administrative reform so i think all of that is a very positive landscape and as we said in our call jade we support the efforts to end conservatorship and given that there is private capital ahead of public capital in every loan that is originated by freddie mac and the great majority of loans that are originated by fannie mae and side by side with public capital in the other portion of fannie mae s multifamily lending the model works and we have great confidence that the model will stay in place i don t want to say regardless of what happens to the agencies but as you well know the entire discussion has changed dramatically over the past couple of years and the role of the federal government in the secondary mortgage market is pretty well established it s just a matter of trying to end conservatorship and what changes come about in that process jade rahmani kbw analyst just lastly turning to credit you noted that there were two loan defaults i wanted to see if you could give any color there on recent credit trends if that signals anything and in particular one of the loan defaults was in the interim loan book was that within the bx inaudible jv and just what drove those two situations steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer jade i ll take that one one i think the high level answer to your question is we don t believe either those two loans signals any trend from a credit standpoint one was a student housing property one was a memory care facility so neither were a market rate multifamily property they are the only delinquent loans in portions of the portfolios that we have credit risk on the ilp loan was on our balance sheet not in the bx joint venture so again i think our view was there s no trend here no change in the credit outlook just two isolated instances they happened to happen in the same quarter jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks very much steve theobald executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator we have no further questions i will turn the floor back over to willy walker for any additional remarks willy walker chairman and chief executive officer thank you everyone for joining us this morning great first quarter and we hope all of you have a terrific day thank you

of 5 in cer terms reflected an increase in sales in all three of our global businesses with a particularly strong performance in vaccines the pharma business continues to shift its portfolio shape well with strong growth from new launches and although consumer had a slow quarter we remain confident and excited about the outlook for this business group adjusted operating margin this quarter was up one percentage point on a cer basis on a total basis earnings per share were up 42 to gbp0 168 and adjusted earnings per share increased 18 to gbp0 301 included within operating margin and eps there are a number of matters of note that benefited the quarter and ian will address these in just a moment nonetheless it s a strong start to the year and we reaffirm our full year guidance our free cash flow this quarter was in line with our expectations with gbp165 million impacted as you know by the launch of generic advair the phasing of rebates and higher restructuring charges all as anticipated two years ago this summer i laid out my long term priorities for the whole company innovation performance and trust all to be powered by a necessary culture change and we ve made a strong start to the focused areas for 2019 we ve continued to execute on our new product launches and have demonstrated strong growth with nucala and trelegy in respiratory and most notably in vaccines with shingrix strengthening our pipeline is critical to our long term success and we ve made good progress here too in hiv we ve already had good uptake for the first of our two drug regimens juluca and we re now seeing the next wave of important innovation come through last month we received us approval for the second of our two drug regimens in hiv for dovato and we re delighted to make this new treatment option available to treatment naive patients and just earlier this week we filed for the us approval of the first long acting injectable hiv treatment cabotegravir plus rilpivirine and we re planning for a potential launch in 2020 we re generating data to support three upcoming oncology filings for bcma in multiple myeloma for zejula in the first line maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer and for dostarlimab in endometrial cancer and we were pleased to close the transactions with merck as well as tesaro further strengthening our growing oncology pipeline in performance we ve continued to drive growth in sales and improvements in our profitability and we ve been working hard on the creation of the consumer health joint venture with pfizer and expect this transaction to close in the second half of the year integration planning is well under way and we ve recently announced the new leadership team for the jv bringing key talent from both companies into the joint venture including brian s counterpart chris slager the president of pfizer consumer healthcare who ll be leading our new combined americas business and lastly on trust we want gsk to continue to lead with a broader contribution to society the best way to build trust is to innovate and we re committed to giving you regular and transparent updates on our innovation progress you re going to hear from hal again on our progress at q2 this year we also remain committed to our global health agenda we re embedding our more focused approach to achieve maximum impact last week the world health organization initiated its first pilot of our rts s malaria vaccine in malawi and we ve also dosed the first patient in a phase 2 study for gsk656 in patients with drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis so in summary we ve had a strong start to an important year of execution with all of our priorities firmly on track so i ll now hand you over to ian who is going to give you more detail on our q1 financial performance iain mackay chief financial officer thanks emma and it s a pleasure for me to be speaking to you in my first quarter as cfo of gsk all the comments i ll make today will be on a constant currency basis except where i specify otherwise and i ll cover both total and adjusted results on slide 8 you ll see a summary of the group s results for q1 which was a strong quarter with 5 revenue growth driven by all three businesses group total operating profit is up 10 with total earnings per share up 42 and on an adjusted basis operating profit was up 9 and adjusted earnings per share up 18 there are number of factors benefiting the first quarter operating profit notably strong growth from shingrix and introduction of authorized generics favorable inventory adjustments in vaccines and phasing of our r d investments i ll go through these in more detail in a moment we delivered gbp165 million of free cash flow in the quarter in line with expectations and please bear in mind that cash flow generation is expected to be to be weighted toward the second half of the year net debt at the end of q1 was gbp27 1 billion the increase from the end of the year was primarily driven by the gbp4 billion acquisition of tesaro along with the adjustment arising from implementation of ifrs 16 of gbp1 3 billion on currency a weaker sterling particularly against the us dollar and japanese yen results in a tailwind of 1 on sales and 4 to adjusted eps slide 9 summarizes the reconciliation of our total to adjusted results the main adjusting items in the quarter were charges relating to intangibles resulting from the tesaro acquisition major restructuring focused on the supply chain representing non cash charges relating to ramp up of the program we announced in july 2018 undervaluation of the embedded derivative in respect of gsk s exposure to movements in hindustan unilever s share price my comments from here onwards are on adjusted results unless stated otherwise on the next few slides we ve listed some of the key drivers of each business s performance and i ll also talk you through how we think they will evolve through the balance of the year slide 10 summarizes the pharmaceutical business where revenues were up 2 luke and david will take you through the performance of some of our key products shortly so i ll just point out a couple of important considerations the dolutegravir franchise delivered growth of 7 while the established hiv products represented a decrease in the quarter dolutegravir in europe showed a decline due to price erosion despite strong underlying volume growth as well as a release of government clawback payments in the comparator period looking ahead we continue to have confidence in the growth outlook of our hiv business our two drug regimen portfolio is important to our future growth and we anticipate dovato will become a key contributor but it will take several quarters as we generate more data gain broad reimbursement and as physicians gain experience with the product respiratory sales were up 25 reflecting the growth of the ellipta portfolio with trelegy delivering a strong performance as well as our injectable therapy nucala i want to remind you that from this quarter we are reporting the ellipta portfolio and nucala within the respiratory category and all other respiratory products including advair seretide under established products relvar breo declined 5 globally and 27 in the us despite good volume growth reflecting the impact of generic advair on pricing in the ics laba class which we ve been signaling for some time now we continue to expect breo to see a decline in the us in 2019 which will result in a slight global decline for relvar breo despite good growth expectations outside the united states our established pharmaceuticals portfolio declined 6 with us advair sales down 27 as expected following the approval of a generic competitor in february as we said at q4 it will take time for inventory levels in the market to adjust and respond to mylan supply there continues to be a number of moving factors including the successful launch for authorized generic which is providing a boost to q1 where the full impact of the mylan launch has yet to be felt keeping these factors in mind our outlook for advair remains unchanged ventolin performance was very strong in q1 also driven by the launch of an authorized generic in january and reflecting a one time benefit from the initial inventory build informed by these factors we still expect the pharmaceutical business revenues to see a slight decline in 2019 before returning to growth in 2020 driven by our new products including zejula dovato juluca trelegy and nucala turning to the operating margin we saw a decline in the quarter mainly driven by an unfavorable product mix due to impact of generic advair tesaro s ph evolution which in line with previous guidance we expect to have a sustained impact over the balance of 2019 and r d spend where we are increasing spending behind priority assets which will accelerate through 2019 slide 11 gives you a quick overview of vaccines performance in q1 with sales up 20 driven mainly by shingrix with continued strong demand in the united states we remain on track to deliver ph doses in line with guidance previously given with good progress made this quarter q1 revenues of gbp357 million is a good indicator of our current expectations of revenue run rate for the remainder of the year the momentum in vaccines business continues to give us confidence in the mid to high single digit outlook for sales compound annual growth out to 2020 in q1 we saw strong improvements in the operating margin driven by enhanced operating leverage particularly from shingrix in the us it is however worth noting that there was a favorable inventory adjustment in the quarter as a result we expect to see q2 vaccines operating margins more in line with our medium term guidance of mid 30s percent which we continue to expect for 2020 turning to slide 12 consumer sales grew 1 despite a drag of around 1 from the combined impact of divestments and the phasing out of low margin contract manufacturing this was a lower growth quarter as we signaled at q4 mainly due to a more competitive environment in europe we re seeing an improvement in performance driven by in market response and expect growth to pick up in q2 for 2019 we continue to expect reported growth to be impacted by the loss of around gbp100 million of revenue from the smaller divestments completed at the end of last year and the phasing out of contract manufacturing as we restructure the consumer supply chain operating profit improved in q1 resulting in an operating margin of 21 7 it s worth remembering that q1 is typically a higher margin quarter due to pre allergy season sell in margin improvements were driven by continued manufacturing simplification as well as ongoing strong cost control we re focused on ensuring we invest in the business to drive innovation and better growth and we expect to see this come through in the remainder of the year overall we remain confident in the prospects for the business and are on track to complete the transaction with pfizer in the second half of the year and the sale of horlicks to unilever by the end of the year subject to regulatory approvals on this next slide we summarize the sales and adjusted operating margin for the group which i ve already covered in some detail moving to the bottom half of the p l there are a couple of things i want to draw out your attention interest expense increased reflecting higher debt levels driven mainly by the tesaro acquisition also there is also an adverse comparison to q1 2018 which had a one off accounting adjustment of gbp20 million through amortization of interest charges the introduction of ifrs 16 in the quarter also resulted in an increase on the interest expense line of gbp11 million on associates we had a one time benefit of gbp51 million reflecting our increased share of after tax profits of innoviva as a result of a non recurring tax benefit and minorities declined reflecting the comparison with q1 2018 which was the last full quarter of distributions to novartis for their share in the previous consumer healthcare joint venture on free cash flow we remain focused on driving greater cash discipline across the group and generated gbp165 million of free cash flow in q1 the reduction from q1 2018 mainly reflects the adverse timing of payments for returns and rebates which we flagged to you at q4 and an increase in trade receivables on the back of stronger sales particularly in vaccines this was partly offset by improved operating profits and lower contingent consideration payments which last year included a milestone payment to novartis as previously noted and seen in prior years the generation of cash flows is expected to be weighted to the second half and we expect to see a step down as the impact of advair generic flows through and rebate payments are made on pre generic sales of advair for your reference we provided a slide in appendix bringing together the key points i made on our outlook for the year and to summarize our guidance for 2019 including that with respect to the dividend remains unchanged our financial priorities are improving working capital management and cash generation allocation of resources to key priorities including the pipeline and ensuring successful launch of new products and the integration of tesaro completion of the consumer jv and disposal of the nutrition business and with that i ll hand over to luke thanks iain good morning and good afternoon in pharma and vaccines our focus on improved commercial execution continues we ve had a good start to the year and overall our growth this year will clearly be impacted by the launch of generic advair we are seeing our new products perform strongly respiratory sales were up 25 at constant exchange rates pleasingly benylsta continues to grow at double digit rates and bexsero achieved sales of gbp156 million up 14 at constant exchange rates i ll now go into more detail on some of our newer products starting in respiratory trelegy continues to do well with sales of gbp87 million in q1 globally launches have had a good start and we now have the only once daily triple therapy for copd in 30 countries around the world 2019 will be an important year for trelegy as we are executing our launch strategy in japan and expect to have approval and launch in china later in the year we re also looking forward to data from the captain study which if successful could enable us to reach patients with asthma that struggle to breathe in asthma biologics nucala remains the market leader in total sales and continues to grow quarter over quarter on past results calls we signaled that we needed to improve commercial execution with nucala there s more work to do but we re seeing some encouraging signs as you can see from this chart it looks at an estimated new patient starts across both retail and non retail segments and we now have closed the gap with inaudible in new patients and are now back to a one to one position versus our closest competitor we track several measures but new patient starts remain a key target because the il5 class as a whole can grow a lot more we estimate that out of the 340 severe eos patients eligible for a biologic in the us less than 25 have received one today finally we re excited about the opportunity to provide the convenience of home administration later this year next slide please i also wanted to highlight zejula a market leading parp inhibitor for recurrent maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer in the us in q1 gsk reported sales of gbp42 million but when factoring in q1 sales prior to the acquisition sales were at gbp56 million our share of the second line maintenance for ovarian cancer is stable and we re looking to improve our competitive focus as we integrate our commercial operations zejula is now approved in 35 countries globally with an established presence in the us germany the uk and italy our teams are now ph establishing france and spain and we plan to launch with a partner in hong kong before the end of the year parps remain an important option for ovarian cancer patients and we continue to believe the class is underappreciated as we ve mentioned before evidence suggests that there is a significant opportunity to help many more patients than those with the gbrca mutation including those who are hiv positive and potentially all comers in the first line maintenance setting linked to this we look forward to getting the prima data which will give us more information about this opportunity by the end of the year moving on we re very pleased by the strong execution of shingrix as we continue to expand and accelerate capacity to deliver the significant step up in doses in 2019 versus 2018 that we had previously indicated to you in the us where demand remains high we re seeing more than 75 of individuals who received their first dose of shingrix complete the two dose series in terms of who is getting vaccinated it s consistent we continue to see more than one third of individuals aged under 65 and also more than one third of those receiving shingrix have previously been vaccinated with the competitor and our capacity expansions remain on track and now i ll hand over to david david redfern chief strategy officer thanks luke good afternoon good morning everyone during q1 hiv grew 4 cer to gbp1 1 billion which comprised the dolutegravir portfolio of triumeq tivicay juluca growing at 7 cer offset by the anticipated continued decline of the mature portfolio this was slightly slower growth than in previous quarters due to the significantly larger base of the overall business and the more competitive environment in the us we remain encouraged by the performance of juluca which is continuing to gain share with greater than 2 200 scripts per week and over 1 800 physicians now prescribing giving sales of gbp70 million in the quarter we have seen a pickup in juluca since the publication of the 96 week sword data in october of last year and this is now being further endorsed by the positive 148 week data around 65 of the juluca business continues to be sourced from non dolutegravir combinations we believe this is a good indicator of growing prescriber confidence in two drug regimens which will now be further reinforced by the launch in the us of dovato the us business grew 3 cer with the dolutegravir portfolio growing by 4 offset by the decline in the mature portfolio in a continuation of a trend we have previously flagged we ve seen some switching of the margin of the triumeq business in particular to both juluca and competitor strs and the overall market share of dolutegravir based regimens in the str and core agent market has declined slightly and is now around 26 5 tivicay descovy remains a popular and broadly stable business and through the second half of the quarter we have seen tivicay mb rx improve future growth in the us will come from our two drug regimens juluca and now dovato in 2019 with cabotegravir rilpivirine long acting providing further momentum subject to fda approval from 2020 in europe the dolutegravir volume grew 8 driven by share growth in most markets but the overall hiv business declined 6 in the quarter this was driven by three factors firstly price cuts over the last few months in france spain and italy all these price cuts were government mandated secondly a challenging 2018 comparator which included a one off clawback release on triumeq in q1 last year in italy and thirdly the drag from the mature portfolio we expect the impact from these factors to reduce to some degree as the year goes on in the international region the business continued to grow strongly at 29 cer including good contributions from japan and brazil next slide turning to dovato we are very pleased by the approval by the fda in april and the recent positive opinion granted by the chmp in europe last week we will continue to invest in generating further clinical evidence to support dovato including in broader patient populations this will include gemini 96 week data which we expect to be available over the summer and if positive should help to reinforce confidence in the durability and resistance barrier of dovato the tango and then subsequently salsa switch studies which we anticipate will enable us to file for a switch indication in the us and also a number of other phase iiib iv studies turning to our long acting injectable cabotegravir rilpivirine we have now filed in the us with the eu submission to come shortly later in the year we will report out the eight week dosing study this is important as it would enable patients to reduce their injections from 12 per year to just six quite an amazing shift if successful from current standard of oral daily oral care with 365 tablets taken per year and finally fostemsavir an important medicine for patients with few treatment options remaining is on track and we continue to anticipate filing by the end of 2019 overall therefore we continue to have confidence in the growth profile of our hiv business with that i will hand back to emma emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much david so as a reminder we ve seen good progress this quarter on our priorities of innovation performance and trust and we are firmly on track with our key areas of focus it s important that we now build on this momentum for the year so we re driving improvements in our operating performance we re progressing our pipeline with a number of major readouts to come and we re working toward a successful integration with pfizer once the consumer jv has completed successfully delivering these priorities over the coming years will provide a clear pathway to the creation of two great businesses one focused on pharma and vaccines the other on consumer health so we are now joined for our q a with hal on the line and also brian and roger and so with that operator the team is now ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you your question and answer session will now begin operator instructions the first question is from the line of keyur parekh of goldman sachs your line is now open please go ahead keyur parekh goldman sachs international analyst good afternoon it s keyur parekh from goldman sachs two questions please one for hal and one for iain hal i noticed there s a slight delay on the timelines for the bcma study in the second line multiple myeloma setting just wondering if you could give us some color around that what s causing this data to go from first half to the second half and then secondly for iain iain as i look at q1 and i look at what s implied for your guidance for the rest of the year it feels like you re implying margin degradation of somewhere in the region of 250 to 300 basis points across the company i realize there are several kind of factors are going to drag margin down but just help us think about kind of is there upside to that margin number where could there be potential for you to take guidance up as you feel more comfortable with the rest of the year thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk well thanks very much keyur so we ll go first to hal and then come over to iain dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d thanks keyur thanks for the question as you know we started a lot of studies to accelerate our anti bcma adc program and i should point out that our timelines for the dreamm 2 monotherapy study in fourth line remains on track and we re expecting to report off the data at the end later this year and file by the end of the year as well as you point out we ve noted a delay in the pilot study in the second line and that was really driven by discussions we were having with the fda and actually decided to modify the protocol to enable us to have more patients and a more robust understanding of the dose response and dose exploration and to enable us to design the dreamm 7 and 8 studies optimally that resulted in increasing number of patients and so that s going to delay the readout but importantly this is not driven by any adverse safety signals in the studies just to remove any concern of that and i should also point out that we re aggressively exploring options to make up for this delay in the dose exploration so that it ll have hopefully less impact on the ultimate approval date emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much hal and so iain following on from our strong start what about any comments on keyur s question on the guidance iain mackay chief financial officer keyur thanks for your question in terms of key influences on outlook for the whole year really no significant change from the guidance we gave at the fourth quarter key influences on it keyur the full integration of tesaro and with that a significant step up in r d expenditure specifically in that area more broadly in r d continuing to invest behind our priority programs across the pipeline another key feature which we still haven t seen the full impact of it playing through in fact really only the initial is the advair genericization and the impact obviously of mylan but also our own the introduction of our own generic advair in that regard and then one other feature which we have mentioned that sits within the first quarter which is somewhat flattering to the operating margin are a couple of inventory adjustments within the vaccines business specifically which would most definitely have an impact on the vaccines operating margin but also more broadly for the group so more broadly within that range of down 5 to 9 notwithstanding a really strong performance from shingrix in the quarter guidance for the moment early as it is very much as it is and it goes without saying hopefully that as the year progresses we ll keep you posted on how we see those margins developing emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much next question please operator next question is from the line of jo walton of credit suisse your line is open please go ahead johannah walton credit suisse securities usa llc analyst thank you my questions are along the same lines i wonder as a new cfo coming in from another industry whether you could give us your initial thoughts on the particularly the cost structures that you see you have highlighted tight cost control going forward it s always interesting to hear another person s views of costs in this industry and the second question going back to generic advair if we look at the prescription numbers it does look as if there may be some capacity constraints with the generic because the generic isn t appearing to gain any more share and the share is stabilizing with yourself and your authorized generic i wonder if you could just tell us what you think is happening in the market because maybe you ve got a better sense of that than we have emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk so hi jo so just firstly on the advair generic i think and then i will come back to iain to speak for his first impressions but it is early days i don t think it s for us to comment on the supply of mylan but at the moment we think we are completely where we would expect and there s no change to the outlook that we ve previously shared in terms of our expectations for advair overall in 2020 but iain would you like to comment on iain mackay chief financial officer comment on costs emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk first impressions iain mackay chief financial officer first impressions as you quite rightly pointed out jo there are both dissimilarities and similarities across the two sectors believe it or not i think initial observations there are a number of important i shan t call them restructurings but refocusing of energy within the firm that i m seeing the early indications of and that is the work that luke and the team is doing across pharma commercial in terms of really orientating the commercial organization to the key priorities around product launch and building revenues and through that process seeing some reorganization from that very effective cost control in that regard equally as we ve talked about before the work that hal is doing in the r d organization about which we talked about in some detail at the midpoint last year also is focused on improving the overall effectiveness but also the efficiency of the r d organization so what i see initially is a strong focus on cost management across the organization whether it s in the sg a areas whether it s specifically within r d whether it s within the supply chain across vaccines pharma and very notably within the consumer the consumer healthcare space as well so i think my first impression is there s a very strong focus on improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness and margins of the organization with a broad range of activities across really every line and cost category across the p l so in summary favorable emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of graham parry of bank of america ml your line is open please go ahead graham parry merrill lynch international uk analyst great thanks for taking our questions first question is on hiv so we start to see some formularies such as express scripts national formularies start to add hiv to its exclusion list this year gsk drugs are still on formulary can you run through whether gsk has had to offer any increased rebates to keep the portfolio there and if you expect that to increase price pressure over time and then secondly on the vaccines margin of 40 i think you talked about what the 2q should look like but it would be helpful if you could just quantify and strip out both the rebate benefit to shingrix and the phasing benefits across the portfolio so we can understand what the right underlying and ongoing level for both shingrix and the rest of the portfolio would be as we re trying to calculate the rest of the year thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much graham so first to david knowing that we ve never given detailed updates on our commercial relationships but first to david and then iain perhaps on the vaccines margin david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks graham so as you say we do have very strong formulary access for tivicay triumeq and juluca very strong coverage and as i ve said it s pretty stable and we are in the discussions over with dovato having been recently approved with the payers in the us and the initial feedback we ve had is the wacc price which is the lowest integrase str in the market has been favorably received and those discussions are going very well so no real significant change in the dynamic i mean i think the one thing that is going on with the payers is that some of them at least are trying to much more actively manage their formularies to line up with the guidelines and hiv is very guideline driven the guidelines are updated regularly so you see some formularies like esi and others excluding some of the older tenofovir based regimens so that is going on but overall very stable and we have very strong coverage and we re very optimistic about the coverage we re going to get for dovato emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk vaccines iain iain mackay chief financial officer yeah graham on the on the vaccines margin front taking broadly the influence of both rebating and inventory adjustments across that portfolio for the quarter it contributed positively about five points to the margin in the quarter together and in total in sterling terms represented about gbp70 million in total so when you when you think about the guidance we provided previously looking out to 2020 that gives you a margin broadly consistent with where we would expect the vaccines business to be in 2020 that is not to say that we would expect necessarily the vaccines business to be at that level for the remainder of this year but that is the impact and that rebating was specific to shingrix and then inventory adjustments were across a broader range of products within the portfolio emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of tim anderson of wolfe research your line is open please go ahead timothy anderson wolfe research llc analyst thank you i have a question on consensus modeling for tivicay and triumeq according to the data that you guys collect consensus really has those two franchises as pretty much flat over a five year window on a global basis but if i look at script trends at least in the us it shows some pretty stiff competition from gilead so i m hoping you can give us some perspective on whether you think consensus modeling again for tivicay and triumeq over something like a five year window is right second question is just if you could disclose emerging market performance in the quarter including china performance thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk okay thanks very much tim so i ll come to david in just a moment to comment a bit on shares and outlook in hiv knowing that we never comment on the specifics of consensus and in terms of emerging markets we were up 6 we don t explicitly disclose on china though we re happy i m sure luke will be happy to give some comments later if anyone wants to ask on what our plans are in our china business but david do you want to just comment on david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks tim so we re not going to comment specifically as emma says on consensus but i ll just make a few remarks i mean firstly obviously hiv is a competitive marketplace but overall actually i think we traded during q1 very much in line with our expectations there has been some switching at the margin as i said in my remarks particularly on triumeq but overall we re running at certainly through the quarter at about 32 000 to 33 000 scripts so relatively stable what is true is that going forward in the us we see the vast majority of the growth coming now from our two drug regimens so juluca initially but hopefully now also dovato and then from next year subject to approval cabotegravir so that is where the growth will come from and to some degree there will be some cannibalization of tivicay and triumeq in the us particularly probably triumeq into the two drug regimes and that will be fine so that is where the growth will come from outside the us it will be more broadly based including tivicay and triumeq emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks david next question please operator next question is from the line of peter welford of jefferies your line is open please go ahead peter welford jefferies international ltd analyst thanks i ve got my customary two questions so firstly on nucala i wonder if you can just comment there in regards to the trends i guess you re seeing now starting to evolve perhaps in the marketplace obviously a new competitor entering and also perhaps new auto administration reaching the market before yours and so how do you sort of think we should think about that product for the remainder of the year given i think some prior sort of more cautious commentary you ve given perhaps ahead of this quarter and then secondly just on bcma inaudible just with regards to the multiple myeloma combo trial with the inaudible that you ve initiated just would love to hear the thinking behind that trial given obviously there s been a number of setbacks with the pd 1s in this indication and also whether or not you re confident manufacturing for that is ready to be able to file by year end when you get the data from the fourth line trial thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk okay luke and then over to hal luke miels president global pharmaceuticals yeah thank you for the question so i mean i think with nucala it s been very much back to basics with us we ve worked very hard to establish a clear positioning in the market we ve focused on productivity of the sales force the medical teams and i think you re starting to see the benefits of that flowing through in terms of the broader dynamics i mean again we i think we re holding our own dupilumab seems to be taking the bulk of its business from inaudible not from the il 5 class and i think that there s no signs of that shifting at this point in terms of and also our expansion beyond the us i think we re doing quite well i think we have a better understanding of the patient profile and the true size of the patient pool in countries in europe and we re doing very well with around 70 market share in japan in terms of the 38 autoinjector i mean it s very very interesting if you look at perception mapping around nucala historically there we were able to work on the efficacy profile we were able to work on the mechanism all of these components but obviously one of the challenges that we had that was difficult to move with what we have available today is this perception around dosing frequency so the opportunity for the autoinjector provides another option for patients and physicians so really they have the choice whether they want to dose every four weeks in the office or write a script and enable those patients to subsequently dose at home so it s an attractive option for us we re very much focused on the launch we expect approval in the second half of the year in the us and europe emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks luke hal dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d yeah thank you for the questions first of all yeah we will have the data to review by end of year and there won t be any concerns really from a manufacturing perspective in terms of filing the fourth line data so in the second part of your question in terms of the pd 1 combination trial it s important to point out actually that the bcma adc really has multiple mechanisms it not only inhibits the bcma signaling which is important for plasma cell survival and obviously the toxin conjugate the adc component gives it enormous potential for destroying the plasma cells as well but the antibodies afucosylated which also gives an immune component so a very enhanced adcc and lastly what we observed preclinically is that there s a there s a significant immune component to this therapy that may be due to the adc or maybe even to the adcc but we see preclinically a very interesting immune response that we think will be synergistic with pd 1 you re right to point out that previous trials with pembro haven t been successful in fact i think taught us a lesson about how to think about pd 1 inhibition in diseases in particular myeloma and we re going to leverage that finding where there sometimes is an early hazard that one needs to progress past in order to see the full benefit as you can see now with the longer term follow up so we think based on the mechanism and based on some preclinical data we think that this is a smart risk to take and we ll see what the data shows emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thank you hal next question please operator next question is from the line of steve scala of cowen your line is open please go ahead steve scala cowen and company llc analyst thank you in 2015 the company provided six or seven pieces of 2015 to 20 guidance iain i m just wondering if you have embraced all seven or if you are revising any and just briefly if you will allow me pharma was low single digit ex vaccines vaccines was mid to high single digit but that now looks light respiratory at 2015 levels that looks light consumer low to mid single digit that looks aggressive total company low to mid single digit eps mid single digit tax rate increased two to three percentage points over the next three to five years and if i missed any please reflect on those as well thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk iain iain mackay chief financial officer steve that was a fairly kick ass question thank you look i think from where from where i sit somebody that started my job 30 days ago what i am particularly focused on is how we close out the remainder of 2019 and build on the progress that we made in the first quarter i think at the fourth quarter we talked about the 2019 guidance and how that took us through to 2020 and in that regard the guidance that we updated then and that we ve reaffirmed today i think is hopefully suitable guidance for you to think about how the pharma as a whole progresses through 2019 and then sets up for 2020 clearly the composition of the business is changing somewhat we re going into a jv subject to approvals with consumer health later this year which will have an impact obviously in terms of how brian and the team perform in that regard and obviously we ve done the transaction in tesaro which clearly changes the shape somewhat of pharma and obviously there s a couple of disposals going on as well so i think the shape the shape of the organization is changing so if i would dare to suggest a way of thinking about the guidance is how we ve updated at the end of last year how we ve updated today or rather reaffirmed around that with a strong focus on execution in 2019 and setting yourself up for 2020 emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of laura sutcliffe of ubs your line is open please go ahead laura sutcliffe ubs ltd analyst hello thanks for taking my questions obviously shingrix is doing very well i noticed you have killed your universal flu vaccine project though so could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you re excited about in the vaccines pipeline what they might be coming up after shingrix and secondly i m going to ask the question that emma mentioned about your ambitions in china could you maybe speak a little bit about that too outside of consumer health thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk of course so we ll come to luke in a moment on china but since we have roger connor also in the room who s been working not only on the improvements in our supply in shingrix but is also responsible for the r d organization there so do you want to comment on the pipeline perhaps roger connor president global vaccines yeah will do listen thank you very much for the question you ll notice that there were two assets in our vaccine pipeline that we have removed this quarter first of all not a concern these are not priority assets just maybe to walk through the assets in particular one was as you mentioned the universal flu asset which is a partnered asset in phase i and ii that we have stopped following an interim data analysis just to emphasize we re still very much committed to flu development and we are looking at the early stages of our pipeline looking at alternative approaches in the universal flu space just for information the other asset that we stopped was a next generation option for prevention of pneumococcal disease we were looking at new technologies there again not viable to go forward again these are not priority assets for us and really allow us to stay focused on our priority assets in our pipeline and maybe i ll just mention two very quickly one is our rsv portfolio i m very excited about this we have in respiratory syncytial virus three different vaccines in development as you as you ll know i m sure rsv is the single biggest cause of hospitalization in infants under one and we have three vaccines in development one for pediatric one for maternal and one for older adults and we look at that portfolio where actually we think there is a real potential for first on best in class vaccines within that portfolio and you may have seen already that our older adult and maternal vaccine in rsv they both have received a prioritized fast track designation from the fda so lots going on in rsv for us and an exciting area on our older adult i should just emphasize as well that vaccine will use to ca modulin system as our shingrix vaccine which proved very effective there and just on another asset in the pipeline that we are looking at very closely in prioritizing is copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease again this vaccine will use our adjuvant system again it ll be a therapeutic vaccine and we re looking to see how do we exploit the adjuvant technology to go into this therapeutic space and on copd in particular this is the first vaccine against copd which is looking to really address exacerbation with and disease progression exacerbations are caused by are associated with let s say bacterial presence and we feel that a vaccine addressing those bacteria could have a big impact so exciting times in the pipeline but those are just two of the priority assets we have emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks roger so luke china luke miels president global pharmaceuticals sure thanks laura so i mean we remain very positive about china i think in contrast to a number of peers we have a very concentrated portfolio there and so when we look at the opportunities i think in in the immediate products that we have today the first is seretide i think it s probably well known to everyone that copd is significantly undertreated even when it is diagnosed in china so we see that as a major opportunity to expand the usage of that product there cervarix we re still in the early days of the introduction there we have around a third of the patients who are taking hpv who are vaccinated with hpv and then linked to that is the opportunity to broaden the vaccines portfolio within china and then underlying all of this is really just working very hard on our commercial and medical execution in country and then ultimately working hard in partnership with hal and his team to accelerate the introduction of pipeline assets such as bcma and hep b into china emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks luke i mean in the end obviously we are starting for the reasons you re all familiar with from a lower base that gives us opportunity for growth in arguably one of the most exciting markets at the moment not least because of deregulation that s going on around innovation as luke has alluded to and we sat on slightly less exposure relatively in terms of the pricing around branded generics so more to come there and we ll see where the shingrix approval goes in due course okay next question please operator next question is from the line of richard parkes of deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead richard parkes deutsche bank ag analyst hi thank you very much for taking my questions first one for iain on free cash flow and the balance sheet you called out and you have done previously a step down in free cash flow generation this year due to generic advair but just wondered if you could give us some kind of steer on where it now might fall out in terms of dividend cover this year and how you re feeling about what flexibility there is still in the balance sheet to do business development and maybe talk about what the path is to deleveraging the balance sheet and maybe get more aggressive there in terms of business development that s the first question then secondly on the hiv franchise obviously european sales saw a decline and i think you flagged the price reductions i m just wondering how you expect that to play out for the full year can hiv in europe still grow this year and are you seeing any impact from tegravir launches in that number thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk so david why don t we go to you first just comment on hiv and then we ll come back to iain no we don t guide on cash flow in the year but i will come back to iain on your other broader finance questions david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks richard so hiv in europe the volume actually grew very strongly dolutegravir volume up 8 with some very good performances in france spain and italy and actually particularly pleased about how juluca has started in france but as i said there was some government mandated price cuts in a few markets so for example in france the fifth anniversary from your launch you often have to take a price cut and that was the case with tivicay so these won t happen every year but it s normal part of life in europe which impacted the quarter and will obviously have an impact across the year and then there was some comparative there was a one off comparative in italy so the impact will dissipate during the year but it won t totally go but overall pretty pleased with the performance i mean in terms of the competition it is obviously heating up in europe particularly in germany which is the markets are all very different in europe germany is probably the most like the us in the sense it s a free market for pricing and also the most favorable to strs and we have seen some switching at the margin there to the competition but everywhere else we ve been growing market share and we re quite pleased emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks david so over to iain and just in terms of the bd appetite point i will say we are largely focused on digesting exactly the rather significant number of deals we have in hands but iain comments overall iain mackay chief financial officer yeah richard thanks for the question clearly strong focus in terms of working capital management cash flow generation across the company with that embedded in everybody s goals and objectives just talking about the full year we talked obviously last year very good year from a cash flow perspective with gbp5 7 billion for the full year what we talked about at the fourth quarter was the expectation a couple of things one lower profitability in line with the guidance for the full year other things kicking in the full impact of advair which we would expect to see coming through over the next quarter or so continued to step up r d and the investment behind our priorities in that pipeline an important factor another thing building on the announcement around the middle of ph 2000 july with respect to restructuring we ll see a bigger impact of restructuring in 2019 so those factors as we said at the end of the year we d expect to see cash generation somewhat lower than was the case in 2018 but nonetheless a very very strong focus in that area guidance today on the dividend obviously no change reaffirmed expectations around the gbp0 80 per share for the full year 2019 and in terms of thinking about capital allocation more broadly and emma talked about really focusing on implementing executing the transactions that we ve got in the pipeline now and realizing value from those transactions clearly one of those the disposition of the nutrition business in india to unilever will generate significant cash flow as the as that deal closes and will go largely to improving overall balance sheet capacity and when we think about that capacity it s around supporting the pipeline returns to shareholders through the dividend and this continued aspect of looking for business development that contributes to strengthening the long term future of the firm subject obviously to pretty strict return criteria and structuring within those transactions but it would not be an understatement to say that there is very very sharp focus across the firm on cash generation emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk yeah i certainly confirm that and just in terms of what the pathway is i ll just remind everybody that in we re obviously very excited about getting to the close subject to necessary approvals of the consumer deal we re then going to be focused on a successful integration which we are confident we can deliver and then up to three years after close we do intend to separate these companies and that will create the reset of the capital structures for both businesses which then creates a whole new level of capacity for that pharma and vaccines company focused on the science of immunology to technology and genetics to both invest in further growth organically and inorganically and deliver returns to shareholders thank you and next question please operator yeah the next question is from the line of simon baker of redburn your line is open please go ahead simon baker redburn partners llp analyst thank you for taking my two questions firstly just continue really off on richard s question on free cash flow perhaps i could broaden out a little for iain to get your perspectives at this admittedly early stage on where free cash flow conversion is notwithstanding the one off effects in the quarter and where you think it could and should be in the coming years and then secondly a question for hal there was a report out from the iqvia institute last week suggesting the potential impact of various new technologies on r d productivity given that the history of r d is littered with technologies which have over promised and under delivered it d be very interesting to get your perspectives on what you think are the principal technological drivers of increased r d productivity over the coming years thanks so much emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk fantastic so we ll come to iain first and then come over to hal on the phone knowing that again he will be giving you an update on the this and including that question i think at q2 but first of all iain any further comments you want to make on cash flow iain mackay chief financial officer not a great deal just to emphasize the focus around working capital management across the organization as a whole and looking broadly across the balance sheet and the wider portfolio in terms of opportunity to create monetization opportunities where returns are presently below hurdle rates that we ve set and that s a piece of work that we do across each of the businesses on an ongoing basis the focus is there really nothing more precise on the guidance in that regard emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain so hal new technologies dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d thanks for the question simon i think there s no question that the r d organizations across pharma can benefit from improvements in productivity and i would say the focus for us is being driven by the observation that only about one in 10 molecules that enter the clinic actually ends up becoming a medicine and helping patients and we re pretty focused on seeing if we can increase that substantially and the three technologies that we have identified as that we believe will improve this dramatically potentially is human genetics and with the reduction in the cost of sequencing as well as the number of people and patients who have been signing up for various sequencing opportunities such as 23andme where we have now millions of patients who ve donated their genetic information to help us understand better targets we think it s going to be a very important technology in addition functional genomics which is essentially taking that genetic data and being able to understand what does it really mean what is the structural variance telling us about human disease could also enable us to find much much better targets and given how massive these datasets can become when you do all these technologies we really do believe that machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to these highly dimensional datasets can unravel the biology in a pretty profound way and all three of these are growing in sophistication and i ll be talking a lot more about this at q2 but we ve already started seeing some interesting targets that were never identified previously and we think that because they re driven really by using the human as the model organism if you will using human genetics and functional genomics we think this could have a significant impact on our probability of success and therefore our productivity but more on that in q2 emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much hal and with that i think we ve come now to the end of the call so i d like to say thank you to everybody for joining good to hear your voices and we look forward to catching up soon thanks bye duration 62 minutes call

execution for gsk and i m pleased we ve made good we ve made good progress this quarter with growth in sales in constant exchange rates across the group and an improved group margin group sales growth of 5 in cer terms reflected an increase in sales in all three of our global businesses with a particularly strong performance in vaccines the pharma business continues to shift its portfolio shape well with strong growth from new launches and although consumer had a slow quarter we remain confident and excited about the outlook for this business group adjusted operating margin this quarter was up one percentage point on a cer basis on a total basis earnings per share were up 42 to gbp0 168 and adjusted earnings per share increased 18 to gbp0 301 included within operating margin and eps there are a number of matters of note that benefited the quarter and ian will address these in just a moment nonetheless it s a strong start to the year and we reaffirm our full year guidance our free cash flow this quarter was in line with our expectations with gbp165 million impacted as you know by the launch of generic advair the phasing of rebates and higher restructuring charges all as anticipated two years ago this summer i laid out my long term priorities for the whole company innovation performance and trust all to be powered by a necessary culture change and we ve made a strong start to the focused areas for 2019 we ve continued to execute on our new product launches and have demonstrated strong growth with nucala and trelegy in respiratory and most notably in vaccines with shingrix strengthening our pipeline is critical to our long term success and we ve made good progress here too in hiv we ve already had good uptake for the first of our two drug regimens juluca and we re now seeing the next wave of important innovation come through last month we received us approval for the second of our two drug regimens in hiv for dovato and we re delighted to make this new treatment option available to treatment naive patients and just earlier this week we filed for the us approval of the first long acting injectable hiv treatment cabotegravir plus rilpivirine and we re planning for a potential launch in 2020 we re generating data to support three upcoming oncology filings for bcma in multiple myeloma for zejula in the first line maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer and for dostarlimab in endometrial cancer and we were pleased to close the transactions with merck as well as tesaro further strengthening our growing oncology pipeline in performance we ve continued to drive growth in sales and improvements in our profitability and we ve been working hard on the creation of the consumer health joint venture with pfizer and expect this transaction to close in the second half of the year integration planning is well under way and we ve recently announced the new leadership team for the jv bringing key talent from both companies into the joint venture including brian s counterpart chris slager the president of pfizer consumer healthcare who ll be leading our new combined americas business and lastly on trust we want gsk to continue to lead with a broader contribution to society the best way to build trust is to innovate and we re committed to giving you regular and transparent updates on our innovation progress you re going to hear from hal again on our progress at q2 this year we also remain committed to our global health agenda we re embedding our more focused approach to achieve maximum impact last week the world health organization initiated its first pilot of our rts s malaria vaccine in malawi and we ve also dosed the first patient in a phase 2 study for gsk656 in patients with drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis so in summary we ve had a strong start to an important year of execution with all of our priorities firmly on track so i ll now hand you over to ian who is going to give you more detail on our q1 financial performance iain mackay chief financial officer thanks emma and it s a pleasure for me to be speaking to you in my first quarter as cfo of gsk all the comments i ll make today will be on a constant currency basis except where i specify otherwise and i ll cover both total and adjusted results on slide 8 you ll see a summary of the group s results for q1 which was a strong quarter with 5 revenue growth driven by all three businesses group total operating profit is up 10 with total earnings per share up 42 and on an adjusted basis operating profit was up 9 and adjusted earnings per share up 18 there are number of factors benefiting the first quarter operating profit notably strong growth from shingrix and introduction of authorized generics favorable inventory adjustments in vaccines and phasing of our r d investments i ll go through these in more detail in a moment we delivered gbp165 million of free cash flow in the quarter in line with expectations and please bear in mind that cash flow generation is expected to be to be weighted toward the second half of the year net debt at the end of q1 was gbp27 1 billion the increase from the end of the year was primarily driven by the gbp4 billion acquisition of tesaro along with the adjustment arising from implementation of ifrs 16 of gbp1 3 billion on currency a weaker sterling particularly against the us dollar and japanese yen results in a tailwind of 1 on sales and 4 to adjusted eps slide 9 summarizes the reconciliation of our total to adjusted results the main adjusting items in the quarter were charges relating to intangibles resulting from the tesaro acquisition major restructuring focused on the supply chain representing non cash charges relating to ramp up of the program we announced in july 2018 undervaluation of the embedded derivative in respect of gsk s exposure to movements in hindustan unilever s share price my comments from here onwards are on adjusted results unless stated otherwise on the next few slides we ve listed some of the key drivers of each business s performance and i ll also talk you through how we think they will evolve through the balance of the year slide 10 summarizes the pharmaceutical business where revenues were up 2 luke and david will take you through the performance of some of our key products shortly so i ll just point out a couple of important considerations the dolutegravir franchise delivered growth of 7 while the established hiv products represented a decrease in the quarter dolutegravir in europe showed a decline due to price erosion despite strong underlying volume growth as well as a release of government clawback payments in the comparator period looking ahead we continue to have confidence in the growth outlook of our hiv business our two drug regimen portfolio is important to our future growth and we anticipate dovato will become a key contributor but it will take several quarters as we generate more data gain broad reimbursement and as physicians gain experience with the product respiratory sales were up 25 reflecting the growth of the ellipta portfolio with trelegy delivering a strong performance as well as our injectable therapy nucala i want to remind you that from this quarter we are reporting the ellipta portfolio and nucala within the respiratory category and all other respiratory products including advair seretide under established products relvar breo declined 5 globally and 27 in the us despite good volume growth reflecting the impact of generic advair on pricing in the ics laba class which we ve been signaling for some time now we continue to expect breo to see a decline in the us in 2019 which will result in a slight global decline for relvar breo despite good growth expectations outside the united states our established pharmaceuticals portfolio declined 6 with us advair sales down 27 as expected following the approval of a generic competitor in february as we said at q4 it will take time for inventory levels in the market to adjust and respond to mylan supply there continues to be a number of moving factors including the successful launch for authorized generic which is providing a boost to q1 where the full impact of the mylan launch has yet to be felt keeping these factors in mind our outlook for advair remains unchanged ventolin performance was very strong in q1 also driven by the launch of an authorized generic in january and reflecting a one time benefit from the initial inventory build informed by these factors we still expect the pharmaceutical business revenues to see a slight decline in 2019 before returning to growth in 2020 driven by our new products including zejula dovato juluca trelegy and nucala turning to the operating margin we saw a decline in the quarter mainly driven by an unfavorable product mix due to impact of generic advair tesaro s ph evolution which in line with previous guidance we expect to have a sustained impact over the balance of 2019 and r d spend where we are increasing spending behind priority assets which will accelerate through 2019 slide 11 gives you a quick overview of vaccines performance in q1 with sales up 20 driven mainly by shingrix with continued strong demand in the united states we remain on track to deliver ph doses in line with guidance previously given with good progress made this quarter q1 revenues of gbp357 million is a good indicator of our current expectations of revenue run rate for the remainder of the year the momentum in vaccines business continues to give us confidence in the mid to high single digit outlook for sales compound annual growth out to 2020 in q1 we saw strong improvements in the operating margin driven by enhanced operating leverage particularly from shingrix in the us it is however worth noting that there was a favorable inventory adjustment in the quarter as a result we expect to see q2 vaccines operating margins more in line with our medium term guidance of mid 30s percent which we continue to expect for 2020 turning to slide 12 consumer sales grew 1 despite a drag of around 1 from the combined impact of divestments and the phasing out of low margin contract manufacturing this was a lower growth quarter as we signaled at q4 mainly due to a more competitive environment in europe we re seeing an improvement in performance driven by in market response and expect growth to pick up in q2 for 2019 we continue to expect reported growth to be impacted by the loss of around gbp100 million of revenue from the smaller divestments completed at the end of last year and the phasing out of contract manufacturing as we restructure the consumer supply chain operating profit improved in q1 resulting in an operating margin of 21 7 it s worth remembering that q1 is typically a higher margin quarter due to pre allergy season sell in margin improvements were driven by continued manufacturing simplification as well as ongoing strong cost control we re focused on ensuring we invest in the business to drive innovation and better growth and we expect to see this come through in the remainder of the year overall we remain confident in the prospects for the business and are on track to complete the transaction with pfizer in the second half of the year and the sale of horlicks to unilever by the end of the year subject to regulatory approvals on this next slide we summarize the sales and adjusted operating margin for the group which i ve already covered in some detail moving to the bottom half of the p l there are a couple of things i want to draw out your attention interest expense increased reflecting higher debt levels driven mainly by the tesaro acquisition also there is also an adverse comparison to q1 2018 which had a one off accounting adjustment of gbp20 million through amortization of interest charges the introduction of ifrs 16 in the quarter also resulted in an increase on the interest expense line of gbp11 million on associates we had a one time benefit of gbp51 million reflecting our increased share of after tax profits of innoviva as a result of a non recurring tax benefit and minorities declined reflecting the comparison with q1 2018 which was the last full quarter of distributions to novartis for their share in the previous consumer healthcare joint venture on free cash flow we remain focused on driving greater cash discipline across the group and generated gbp165 million of free cash flow in q1 the reduction from q1 2018 mainly reflects the adverse timing of payments for returns and rebates which we flagged to you at q4 and an increase in trade receivables on the back of stronger sales particularly in vaccines this was partly offset by improved operating profits and lower contingent consideration payments which last year included a milestone payment to novartis as previously noted and seen in prior years the generation of cash flows is expected to be weighted to the second half and we expect to see a step down as the impact of advair generic flows through and rebate payments are made on pre generic sales of advair for your reference we provided a slide in appendix bringing together the key points i made on our outlook for the year and to summarize our guidance for 2019 including that with respect to the dividend remains unchanged our financial priorities are improving working capital management and cash generation allocation of resources to key priorities including the pipeline and ensuring successful launch of new products and the integration of tesaro completion of the consumer jv and disposal of the nutrition business and with that i ll hand over to luke thanks iain good morning and good afternoon in pharma and vaccines our focus on improved commercial execution continues we ve had a good start to the year and overall our growth this year will clearly be impacted by the launch of generic advair we are seeing our new products perform strongly respiratory sales were up 25 at constant exchange rates pleasingly benylsta continues to grow at double digit rates and bexsero achieved sales of gbp156 million up 14 at constant exchange rates i ll now go into more detail on some of our newer products starting in respiratory trelegy continues to do well with sales of gbp87 million in q1 globally launches have had a good start and we now have the only once daily triple therapy for copd in 30 countries around the world 2019 will be an important year for trelegy as we are executing our launch strategy in japan and expect to have approval and launch in china later in the year we re also looking forward to data from the captain study which if successful could enable us to reach patients with asthma that struggle to breathe in asthma biologics nucala remains the market leader in total sales and continues to grow quarter over quarter on past results calls we signaled that we needed to improve commercial execution with nucala there s more work to do but we re seeing some encouraging signs as you can see from this chart it looks at an estimated new patient starts across both retail and non retail segments and we now have closed the gap with inaudible in new patients and are now back to a one to one position versus our closest competitor we track several measures but new patient starts remain a key target because the il5 class as a whole can grow a lot more we estimate that out of the 340 severe eos patients eligible for a biologic in the us less than 25 have received one today finally we re excited about the opportunity to provide the convenience of home administration later this year next slide please i also wanted to highlight zejula a market leading parp inhibitor for recurrent maintenance therapy of ovarian cancer in the us in q1 gsk reported sales of gbp42 million but when factoring in q1 sales prior to the acquisition sales were at gbp56 million our share of the second line maintenance for ovarian cancer is stable and we re looking to improve our competitive focus as we integrate our commercial operations zejula is now approved in 35 countries globally with an established presence in the us germany the uk and italy our teams are now ph establishing france and spain and we plan to launch with a partner in hong kong before the end of the year parps remain an important option for ovarian cancer patients and we continue to believe the class is underappreciated as we ve mentioned before evidence suggests that there is a significant opportunity to help many more patients than those with the gbrca mutation including those who are hiv positive and potentially all comers in the first line maintenance setting linked to this we look forward to getting the prima data which will give us more information about this opportunity by the end of the year moving on we re very pleased by the strong execution of shingrix as we continue to expand and accelerate capacity to deliver the significant step up in doses in 2019 versus 2018 that we had previously indicated to you in the us where demand remains high we re seeing more than 75 of individuals who received their first dose of shingrix complete the two dose series in terms of who is getting vaccinated it s consistent we continue to see more than one third of individuals aged under 65 and also more than one third of those receiving shingrix have previously been vaccinated with the competitor and our capacity expansions remain on track and now i ll hand over to david david redfern chief strategy officer thanks luke good afternoon good morning everyone during q1 hiv grew 4 cer to gbp1 1 billion which comprised the dolutegravir portfolio of triumeq tivicay juluca growing at 7 cer offset by the anticipated continued decline of the mature portfolio this was slightly slower growth than in previous quarters due to the significantly larger base of the overall business and the more competitive environment in the us we remain encouraged by the performance of juluca which is continuing to gain share with greater than 2 200 scripts per week and over 1 800 physicians now prescribing giving sales of gbp70 million in the quarter we have seen a pickup in juluca since the publication of the 96 week sword data in october of last year and this is now being further endorsed by the positive 148 week data around 65 of the juluca business continues to be sourced from non dolutegravir combinations we believe this is a good indicator of growing prescriber confidence in two drug regimens which will now be further reinforced by the launch in the us of dovato the us business grew 3 cer with the dolutegravir portfolio growing by 4 offset by the decline in the mature portfolio in a continuation of a trend we have previously flagged we ve seen some switching of the margin of the triumeq business in particular to both juluca and competitor strs and the overall market share of dolutegravir based regimens in the str and core agent market has declined slightly and is now around 26 5 tivicay descovy remains a popular and broadly stable business and through the second half of the quarter we have seen tivicay mb rx improve future growth in the us will come from our two drug regimens juluca and now dovato in 2019 with cabotegravir rilpivirine long acting providing further momentum subject to fda approval from 2020 in europe the dolutegravir volume grew 8 driven by share growth in most markets but the overall hiv business declined 6 in the quarter this was driven by three factors firstly price cuts over the last few months in france spain and italy all these price cuts were government mandated secondly a challenging 2018 comparator which included a one off clawback release on triumeq in q1 last year in italy and thirdly the drag from the mature portfolio we expect the impact from these factors to reduce to some degree as the year goes on in the international region the business continued to grow strongly at 29 cer including good contributions from japan and brazil next slide turning to dovato we are very pleased by the approval by the fda in april and the recent positive opinion granted by the chmp in europe last week we will continue to invest in generating further clinical evidence to support dovato including in broader patient populations this will include gemini 96 week data which we expect to be available over the summer and if positive should help to reinforce confidence in the durability and resistance barrier of dovato the tango and then subsequently salsa switch studies which we anticipate will enable us to file for a switch indication in the us and also a number of other phase iiib iv studies turning to our long acting injectable cabotegravir rilpivirine we have now filed in the us with the eu submission to come shortly later in the year we will report out the eight week dosing study this is important as it would enable patients to reduce their injections from 12 per year to just six quite an amazing shift if successful from current standard of oral daily oral care with 365 tablets taken per year and finally fostemsavir an important medicine for patients with few treatment options remaining is on track and we continue to anticipate filing by the end of 2019 overall therefore we continue to have confidence in the growth profile of our hiv business with that i will hand back to emma emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much david so as a reminder we ve seen good progress this quarter on our priorities of innovation performance and trust and we are firmly on track with our key areas of focus it s important that we now build on this momentum for the year so we re driving improvements in our operating performance we re progressing our pipeline with a number of major readouts to come and we re working toward a successful integration with pfizer once the consumer jv has completed successfully delivering these priorities over the coming years will provide a clear pathway to the creation of two great businesses one focused on pharma and vaccines the other on consumer health so we are now joined for our q a with hal on the line and also brian and roger and so with that operator the team is now ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you your question and answer session will now begin operator instructions the first question is from the line of keyur parekh of goldman sachs your line is now open please go ahead keyur parekh goldman sachs international analyst good afternoon it s keyur parekh from goldman sachs two questions please one for hal and one for iain hal i noticed there s a slight delay on the timelines for the bcma study in the second line multiple myeloma setting just wondering if you could give us some color around that what s causing this data to go from first half to the second half and then secondly for iain iain as i look at q1 and i look at what s implied for your guidance for the rest of the year it feels like you re implying margin degradation of somewhere in the region of 250 to 300 basis points across the company i realize there are several kind of factors are going to drag margin down but just help us think about kind of is there upside to that margin number where could there be potential for you to take guidance up as you feel more comfortable with the rest of the year thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk well thanks very much keyur so we ll go first to hal and then come over to iain dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d thanks keyur thanks for the question as you know we started a lot of studies to accelerate our anti bcma adc program and i should point out that our timelines for the dreamm 2 monotherapy study in fourth line remains on track and we re expecting to report off the data at the end later this year and file by the end of the year as well as you point out we ve noted a delay in the pilot study in the second line and that was really driven by discussions we were having with the fda and actually decided to modify the protocol to enable us to have more patients and a more robust understanding of the dose response and dose exploration and to enable us to design the dreamm 7 and 8 studies optimally that resulted in increasing number of patients and so that s going to delay the readout but importantly this is not driven by any adverse safety signals in the studies just to remove any concern of that and i should also point out that we re aggressively exploring options to make up for this delay in the dose exploration so that it ll have hopefully less impact on the ultimate approval date emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much hal and so iain following on from our strong start what about any comments on keyur s question on the guidance iain mackay chief financial officer keyur thanks for your question in terms of key influences on outlook for the whole year really no significant change from the guidance we gave at the fourth quarter key influences on it keyur the full integration of tesaro and with that a significant step up in r d expenditure specifically in that area more broadly in r d continuing to invest behind our priority programs across the pipeline another key feature which we still haven t seen the full impact of it playing through in fact really only the initial is the advair genericization and the impact obviously of mylan but also our own the introduction of our own generic advair in that regard and then one other feature which we have mentioned that sits within the first quarter which is somewhat flattering to the operating margin are a couple of inventory adjustments within the vaccines business specifically which would most definitely have an impact on the vaccines operating margin but also more broadly for the group so more broadly within that range of down 5 to 9 notwithstanding a really strong performance from shingrix in the quarter guidance for the moment early as it is very much as it is and it goes without saying hopefully that as the year progresses we ll keep you posted on how we see those margins developing emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much next question please operator next question is from the line of jo walton of credit suisse your line is open please go ahead johannah walton credit suisse securities usa llc analyst thank you my questions are along the same lines i wonder as a new cfo coming in from another industry whether you could give us your initial thoughts on the particularly the cost structures that you see you have highlighted tight cost control going forward it s always interesting to hear another person s views of costs in this industry and the second question going back to generic advair if we look at the prescription numbers it does look as if there may be some capacity constraints with the generic because the generic isn t appearing to gain any more share and the share is stabilizing with yourself and your authorized generic i wonder if you could just tell us what you think is happening in the market because maybe you ve got a better sense of that than we have emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk so hi jo so just firstly on the advair generic i think and then i will come back to iain to speak for his first impressions but it is early days i don t think it s for us to comment on the supply of mylan but at the moment we think we are completely where we would expect and there s no change to the outlook that we ve previously shared in terms of our expectations for advair overall in 2020 but iain would you like to comment on iain mackay chief financial officer comment on costs emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk first impressions iain mackay chief financial officer first impressions as you quite rightly pointed out jo there are both dissimilarities and similarities across the two sectors believe it or not i think initial observations there are a number of important i shan t call them restructurings but refocusing of energy within the firm that i m seeing the early indications of and that is the work that luke and the team is doing across pharma commercial in terms of really orientating the commercial organization to the key priorities around product launch and building revenues and through that process seeing some reorganization from that very effective cost control in that regard equally as we ve talked about before the work that hal is doing in the r d organization about which we talked about in some detail at the midpoint last year also is focused on improving the overall effectiveness but also the efficiency of the r d organization so what i see initially is a strong focus on cost management across the organization whether it s in the sg a areas whether it s specifically within r d whether it s within the supply chain across vaccines pharma and very notably within the consumer the consumer healthcare space as well so i think my first impression is there s a very strong focus on improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness and margins of the organization with a broad range of activities across really every line and cost category across the p l so in summary favorable emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of graham parry of bank of america ml your line is open please go ahead graham parry merrill lynch international uk analyst great thanks for taking our questions first question is on hiv so we start to see some formularies such as express scripts national formularies start to add hiv to its exclusion list this year gsk drugs are still on formulary can you run through whether gsk has had to offer any increased rebates to keep the portfolio there and if you expect that to increase price pressure over time and then secondly on the vaccines margin of 40 i think you talked about what the 2q should look like but it would be helpful if you could just quantify and strip out both the rebate benefit to shingrix and the phasing benefits across the portfolio so we can understand what the right underlying and ongoing level for both shingrix and the rest of the portfolio would be as we re trying to calculate the rest of the year thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much graham so first to david knowing that we ve never given detailed updates on our commercial relationships but first to david and then iain perhaps on the vaccines margin david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks graham so as you say we do have very strong formulary access for tivicay triumeq and juluca very strong coverage and as i ve said it s pretty stable and we are in the discussions over with dovato having been recently approved with the payers in the us and the initial feedback we ve had is the wacc price which is the lowest integrase str in the market has been favorably received and those discussions are going very well so no real significant change in the dynamic i mean i think the one thing that is going on with the payers is that some of them at least are trying to much more actively manage their formularies to line up with the guidelines and hiv is very guideline driven the guidelines are updated regularly so you see some formularies like esi and others excluding some of the older tenofovir based regimens so that is going on but overall very stable and we have very strong coverage and we re very optimistic about the coverage we re going to get for dovato emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk vaccines iain iain mackay chief financial officer yeah graham on the on the vaccines margin front taking broadly the influence of both rebating and inventory adjustments across that portfolio for the quarter it contributed positively about five points to the margin in the quarter together and in total in sterling terms represented about gbp70 million in total so when you when you think about the guidance we provided previously looking out to 2020 that gives you a margin broadly consistent with where we would expect the vaccines business to be in 2020 that is not to say that we would expect necessarily the vaccines business to be at that level for the remainder of this year but that is the impact and that rebating was specific to shingrix and then inventory adjustments were across a broader range of products within the portfolio emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of tim anderson of wolfe research your line is open please go ahead timothy anderson wolfe research llc analyst thank you i have a question on consensus modeling for tivicay and triumeq according to the data that you guys collect consensus really has those two franchises as pretty much flat over a five year window on a global basis but if i look at script trends at least in the us it shows some pretty stiff competition from gilead so i m hoping you can give us some perspective on whether you think consensus modeling again for tivicay and triumeq over something like a five year window is right second question is just if you could disclose emerging market performance in the quarter including china performance thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk okay thanks very much tim so i ll come to david in just a moment to comment a bit on shares and outlook in hiv knowing that we never comment on the specifics of consensus and in terms of emerging markets we were up 6 we don t explicitly disclose on china though we re happy i m sure luke will be happy to give some comments later if anyone wants to ask on what our plans are in our china business but david do you want to just comment on david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks tim so we re not going to comment specifically as emma says on consensus but i ll just make a few remarks i mean firstly obviously hiv is a competitive marketplace but overall actually i think we traded during q1 very much in line with our expectations there has been some switching at the margin as i said in my remarks particularly on triumeq but overall we re running at certainly through the quarter at about 32 000 to 33 000 scripts so relatively stable what is true is that going forward in the us we see the vast majority of the growth coming now from our two drug regimens so juluca initially but hopefully now also dovato and then from next year subject to approval cabotegravir so that is where the growth will come from and to some degree there will be some cannibalization of tivicay and triumeq in the us particularly probably triumeq into the two drug regimes and that will be fine so that is where the growth will come from outside the us it will be more broadly based including tivicay and triumeq emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks david next question please operator next question is from the line of peter welford of jefferies your line is open please go ahead peter welford jefferies international ltd analyst thanks i ve got my customary two questions so firstly on nucala i wonder if you can just comment there in regards to the trends i guess you re seeing now starting to evolve perhaps in the marketplace obviously a new competitor entering and also perhaps new auto administration reaching the market before yours and so how do you sort of think we should think about that product for the remainder of the year given i think some prior sort of more cautious commentary you ve given perhaps ahead of this quarter and then secondly just on bcma inaudible just with regards to the multiple myeloma combo trial with the inaudible that you ve initiated just would love to hear the thinking behind that trial given obviously there s been a number of setbacks with the pd 1s in this indication and also whether or not you re confident manufacturing for that is ready to be able to file by year end when you get the data from the fourth line trial thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk okay luke and then over to hal luke miels president global pharmaceuticals yeah thank you for the question so i mean i think with nucala it s been very much back to basics with us we ve worked very hard to establish a clear positioning in the market we ve focused on productivity of the sales force the medical teams and i think you re starting to see the benefits of that flowing through in terms of the broader dynamics i mean again we i think we re holding our own dupilumab seems to be taking the bulk of its business from inaudible not from the il 5 class and i think that there s no signs of that shifting at this point in terms of and also our expansion beyond the us i think we re doing quite well i think we have a better understanding of the patient profile and the true size of the patient pool in countries in europe and we re doing very well with around 70 market share in japan in terms of the 38 autoinjector i mean it s very very interesting if you look at perception mapping around nucala historically there we were able to work on the efficacy profile we were able to work on the mechanism all of these components but obviously one of the challenges that we had that was difficult to move with what we have available today is this perception around dosing frequency so the opportunity for the autoinjector provides another option for patients and physicians so really they have the choice whether they want to dose every four weeks in the office or write a script and enable those patients to subsequently dose at home so it s an attractive option for us we re very much focused on the launch we expect approval in the second half of the year in the us and europe emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks luke hal dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d yeah thank you for the questions first of all yeah we will have the data to review by end of year and there won t be any concerns really from a manufacturing perspective in terms of filing the fourth line data so in the second part of your question in terms of the pd 1 combination trial it s important to point out actually that the bcma adc really has multiple mechanisms it not only inhibits the bcma signaling which is important for plasma cell survival and obviously the toxin conjugate the adc component gives it enormous potential for destroying the plasma cells as well but the antibodies afucosylated which also gives an immune component so a very enhanced adcc and lastly what we observed preclinically is that there s a there s a significant immune component to this therapy that may be due to the adc or maybe even to the adcc but we see preclinically a very interesting immune response that we think will be synergistic with pd 1 you re right to point out that previous trials with pembro haven t been successful in fact i think taught us a lesson about how to think about pd 1 inhibition in diseases in particular myeloma and we re going to leverage that finding where there sometimes is an early hazard that one needs to progress past in order to see the full benefit as you can see now with the longer term follow up so we think based on the mechanism and based on some preclinical data we think that this is a smart risk to take and we ll see what the data shows emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thank you hal next question please operator next question is from the line of steve scala of cowen your line is open please go ahead steve scala cowen and company llc analyst thank you in 2015 the company provided six or seven pieces of 2015 to 20 guidance iain i m just wondering if you have embraced all seven or if you are revising any and just briefly if you will allow me pharma was low single digit ex vaccines vaccines was mid to high single digit but that now looks light respiratory at 2015 levels that looks light consumer low to mid single digit that looks aggressive total company low to mid single digit eps mid single digit tax rate increased two to three percentage points over the next three to five years and if i missed any please reflect on those as well thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk iain iain mackay chief financial officer steve that was a fairly kick ass question thank you look i think from where from where i sit somebody that started my job 30 days ago what i am particularly focused on is how we close out the remainder of 2019 and build on the progress that we made in the first quarter i think at the fourth quarter we talked about the 2019 guidance and how that took us through to 2020 and in that regard the guidance that we updated then and that we ve reaffirmed today i think is hopefully suitable guidance for you to think about how the pharma as a whole progresses through 2019 and then sets up for 2020 clearly the composition of the business is changing somewhat we re going into a jv subject to approvals with consumer health later this year which will have an impact obviously in terms of how brian and the team perform in that regard and obviously we ve done the transaction in tesaro which clearly changes the shape somewhat of pharma and obviously there s a couple of disposals going on as well so i think the shape the shape of the organization is changing so if i would dare to suggest a way of thinking about the guidance is how we ve updated at the end of last year how we ve updated today or rather reaffirmed around that with a strong focus on execution in 2019 and setting yourself up for 2020 emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain next question please operator next question is from the line of laura sutcliffe of ubs your line is open please go ahead laura sutcliffe ubs ltd analyst hello thanks for taking my questions obviously shingrix is doing very well i noticed you have killed your universal flu vaccine project though so could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you re excited about in the vaccines pipeline what they might be coming up after shingrix and secondly i m going to ask the question that emma mentioned about your ambitions in china could you maybe speak a little bit about that too outside of consumer health thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk of course so we ll come to luke in a moment on china but since we have roger connor also in the room who s been working not only on the improvements in our supply in shingrix but is also responsible for the r d organization there so do you want to comment on the pipeline perhaps roger connor president global vaccines yeah will do listen thank you very much for the question you ll notice that there were two assets in our vaccine pipeline that we have removed this quarter first of all not a concern these are not priority assets just maybe to walk through the assets in particular one was as you mentioned the universal flu asset which is a partnered asset in phase i and ii that we have stopped following an interim data analysis just to emphasize we re still very much committed to flu development and we are looking at the early stages of our pipeline looking at alternative approaches in the universal flu space just for information the other asset that we stopped was a next generation option for prevention of pneumococcal disease we were looking at new technologies there again not viable to go forward again these are not priority assets for us and really allow us to stay focused on our priority assets in our pipeline and maybe i ll just mention two very quickly one is our rsv portfolio i m very excited about this we have in respiratory syncytial virus three different vaccines in development as you as you ll know i m sure rsv is the single biggest cause of hospitalization in infants under one and we have three vaccines in development one for pediatric one for maternal and one for older adults and we look at that portfolio where actually we think there is a real potential for first on best in class vaccines within that portfolio and you may have seen already that our older adult and maternal vaccine in rsv they both have received a prioritized fast track designation from the fda so lots going on in rsv for us and an exciting area on our older adult i should just emphasize as well that vaccine will use to ca modulin system as our shingrix vaccine which proved very effective there and just on another asset in the pipeline that we are looking at very closely in prioritizing is copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease again this vaccine will use our adjuvant system again it ll be a therapeutic vaccine and we re looking to see how do we exploit the adjuvant technology to go into this therapeutic space and on copd in particular this is the first vaccine against copd which is looking to really address exacerbation with and disease progression exacerbations are caused by are associated with let s say bacterial presence and we feel that a vaccine addressing those bacteria could have a big impact so exciting times in the pipeline but those are just two of the priority assets we have emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks roger so luke china luke miels president global pharmaceuticals sure thanks laura so i mean we remain very positive about china i think in contrast to a number of peers we have a very concentrated portfolio there and so when we look at the opportunities i think in in the immediate products that we have today the first is seretide i think it s probably well known to everyone that copd is significantly undertreated even when it is diagnosed in china so we see that as a major opportunity to expand the usage of that product there cervarix we re still in the early days of the introduction there we have around a third of the patients who are taking hpv who are vaccinated with hpv and then linked to that is the opportunity to broaden the vaccines portfolio within china and then underlying all of this is really just working very hard on our commercial and medical execution in country and then ultimately working hard in partnership with hal and his team to accelerate the introduction of pipeline assets such as bcma and hep b into china emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks luke i mean in the end obviously we are starting for the reasons you re all familiar with from a lower base that gives us opportunity for growth in arguably one of the most exciting markets at the moment not least because of deregulation that s going on around innovation as luke has alluded to and we sat on slightly less exposure relatively in terms of the pricing around branded generics so more to come there and we ll see where the shingrix approval goes in due course okay next question please operator next question is from the line of richard parkes of deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead richard parkes deutsche bank ag analyst hi thank you very much for taking my questions first one for iain on free cash flow and the balance sheet you called out and you have done previously a step down in free cash flow generation this year due to generic advair but just wondered if you could give us some kind of steer on where it now might fall out in terms of dividend cover this year and how you re feeling about what flexibility there is still in the balance sheet to do business development and maybe talk about what the path is to deleveraging the balance sheet and maybe get more aggressive there in terms of business development that s the first question then secondly on the hiv franchise obviously european sales saw a decline and i think you flagged the price reductions i m just wondering how you expect that to play out for the full year can hiv in europe still grow this year and are you seeing any impact from tegravir launches in that number thank you emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk so david why don t we go to you first just comment on hiv and then we ll come back to iain no we don t guide on cash flow in the year but i will come back to iain on your other broader finance questions david redfern chief strategy officer yes thanks richard so hiv in europe the volume actually grew very strongly dolutegravir volume up 8 with some very good performances in france spain and italy and actually particularly pleased about how juluca has started in france but as i said there was some government mandated price cuts in a few markets so for example in france the fifth anniversary from your launch you often have to take a price cut and that was the case with tivicay so these won t happen every year but it s normal part of life in europe which impacted the quarter and will obviously have an impact across the year and then there was some comparative there was a one off comparative in italy so the impact will dissipate during the year but it won t totally go but overall pretty pleased with the performance i mean in terms of the competition it is obviously heating up in europe particularly in germany which is the markets are all very different in europe germany is probably the most like the us in the sense it s a free market for pricing and also the most favorable to strs and we have seen some switching at the margin there to the competition but everywhere else we ve been growing market share and we re quite pleased emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks david so over to iain and just in terms of the bd appetite point i will say we are largely focused on digesting exactly the rather significant number of deals we have in hands but iain comments overall iain mackay chief financial officer yeah richard thanks for the question clearly strong focus in terms of working capital management cash flow generation across the company with that embedded in everybody s goals and objectives just talking about the full year we talked obviously last year very good year from a cash flow perspective with gbp5 7 billion for the full year what we talked about at the fourth quarter was the expectation a couple of things one lower profitability in line with the guidance for the full year other things kicking in the full impact of advair which we would expect to see coming through over the next quarter or so continued to step up r d and the investment behind our priorities in that pipeline an important factor another thing building on the announcement around the middle of ph 2000 july with respect to restructuring we ll see a bigger impact of restructuring in 2019 so those factors as we said at the end of the year we d expect to see cash generation somewhat lower than was the case in 2018 but nonetheless a very very strong focus in that area guidance today on the dividend obviously no change reaffirmed expectations around the gbp0 80 per share for the full year 2019 and in terms of thinking about capital allocation more broadly and emma talked about really focusing on implementing executing the transactions that we ve got in the pipeline now and realizing value from those transactions clearly one of those the disposition of the nutrition business in india to unilever will generate significant cash flow as the as that deal closes and will go largely to improving overall balance sheet capacity and when we think about that capacity it s around supporting the pipeline returns to shareholders through the dividend and this continued aspect of looking for business development that contributes to strengthening the long term future of the firm subject obviously to pretty strict return criteria and structuring within those transactions but it would not be an understatement to say that there is very very sharp focus across the firm on cash generation emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk yeah i certainly confirm that and just in terms of what the pathway is i ll just remind everybody that in we re obviously very excited about getting to the close subject to necessary approvals of the consumer deal we re then going to be focused on a successful integration which we are confident we can deliver and then up to three years after close we do intend to separate these companies and that will create the reset of the capital structures for both businesses which then creates a whole new level of capacity for that pharma and vaccines company focused on the science of immunology to technology and genetics to both invest in further growth organically and inorganically and deliver returns to shareholders thank you and next question please operator yeah the next question is from the line of simon baker of redburn your line is open please go ahead simon baker redburn partners llp analyst thank you for taking my two questions firstly just continue really off on richard s question on free cash flow perhaps i could broaden out a little for iain to get your perspectives at this admittedly early stage on where free cash flow conversion is notwithstanding the one off effects in the quarter and where you think it could and should be in the coming years and then secondly a question for hal there was a report out from the iqvia institute last week suggesting the potential impact of various new technologies on r d productivity given that the history of r d is littered with technologies which have over promised and under delivered it d be very interesting to get your perspectives on what you think are the principal technological drivers of increased r d productivity over the coming years thanks so much emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk fantastic so we ll come to iain first and then come over to hal on the phone knowing that again he will be giving you an update on the this and including that question i think at q2 but first of all iain any further comments you want to make on cash flow iain mackay chief financial officer not a great deal just to emphasize the focus around working capital management across the organization as a whole and looking broadly across the balance sheet and the wider portfolio in terms of opportunity to create monetization opportunities where returns are presently below hurdle rates that we ve set and that s a piece of work that we do across each of the businesses on an ongoing basis the focus is there really nothing more precise on the guidance in that regard emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks iain so hal new technologies dr hal barron chief scientific officer and president r d thanks for the question simon i think there s no question that the r d organizations across pharma can benefit from improvements in productivity and i would say the focus for us is being driven by the observation that only about one in 10 molecules that enter the clinic actually ends up becoming a medicine and helping patients and we re pretty focused on seeing if we can increase that substantially and the three technologies that we have identified as that we believe will improve this dramatically potentially is human genetics and with the reduction in the cost of sequencing as well as the number of people and patients who have been signing up for various sequencing opportunities such as 23andme where we have now millions of patients who ve donated their genetic information to help us understand better targets we think it s going to be a very important technology in addition functional genomics which is essentially taking that genetic data and being able to understand what does it really mean what is the structural variance telling us about human disease could also enable us to find much much better targets and given how massive these datasets can become when you do all these technologies we really do believe that machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to these highly dimensional datasets can unravel the biology in a pretty profound way and all three of these are growing in sophistication and i ll be talking a lot more about this at q2 but we ve already started seeing some interesting targets that were never identified previously and we think that because they re driven really by using the human as the model organism if you will using human genetics and functional genomics we think this could have a significant impact on our probability of success and therefore our productivity but more on that in q2 emma walmsley emma walmsley chief executive officer of gsk thanks very much hal and with that i think we ve come now to the end of the call so i d like to say thank you to everybody for joining good to hear your voices and we look forward to catching up soon thanks bye duration 62 minutes call

june 10 we will be at stifel s cross sector insight conference in boston we hope to see you at these events i will now turn the call over to dave dave heinzmann lfus thanks trisha good morning and thanks for joining us today we delivered a solid first quarter in line with our sales and adjusted eps guidance we achieved revenue of 406 million and our adjusted eps of 1 96 was above the midpoint of our guidance range during the first quarter we continued to see good design win activity across the electronics industrial and transportation end markets we serve driven by the strong fundamentals of the business and the content opportunities driven by a safer cleaner and more connected world later i will provide more commentary on the performance of the business with ongoing softness in global auto production and excess channel inventories in electronics we anticipate soft demand to persist we continue to expect improving conditions in the second half of the year despite slower growth in some areas of our end markets we remain well positioned to continue the execution of our 5 year strategy of double digit sales and earnings growth we ve demonstrated in the past we will deliver exceptional value for our shareholders by driving above market sales growth leveraging our operational excellence and managing our costs to align to business conditions with that brief introduction i will now turn the call over to meenal to provide additional color on our financial results meenal anil sethna cfo thanks dave and good morning everyone i ll start with highlights from our first quarter of 2019 sales of 406 million met guidance and as projected we re down 3 overall and 4 organically versus last year foreign exchange headwind of 2 was higher than we had projected while acquisitions net of business exit added 3 sales growth sales across our electronics and industrial segments finished largely as we expected our automotive segment sales were slightly softer than our expectation global car build excluding japan where we have limited automotive sales was down 7 a greater decline than we had expected gaap operating margins were 15 while adjusted operating margins finished at 16 2 sequentially adjusted operating margins improved 110 basis points on essentially flat sales more than offsetting foreign exchange headwind this improvement was a combination of our team s ongoing efforts to contain costs while driving ongoing benefits from ixys synergy initiatives first quarter gaap diluted eps was 1 48 gaap eps included 12 million in after tax charges mainly due to nonoperating foreign exchange losses as well as acquisition integration and restructuring charges adjusted diluted eps of 1 96 for the quarter was above our guidance midpoint of 1 93 foreign exchange headwinds along with negative mark to market comparisons reduced adjusted eps by about 0 27 compared to last year lower volumes and associated leverage partially offset by lower expenses resulting from our ixys synergies and cost containment efforts drove the remainder of our eps decline over last year our gaap effective tax rate was 20 3 for the quarter our adjusted effective tax rate was 19 7 essentially flat to last year now let me provide some additional performance highlights by product segment for the first quarter currency headwinds followed by lower year over year sales volumes and leverage had the largest impact to our company operating margin the volume and leverage drop have the greatest margin impact within our electronics segment excess inventory reductions at our channel partners was the main driver of volume decline this volume impact more than offset benefits from the ixys cost synergies that we had started to drive in the first quarter last year our automotive margins were heavily impacted by foreign exchange which was about a 400 basis point headwind versus last year excluding foreign exchange impacts our automotive margins would have been up year over year despite lower volumes sequentially segment margins improved 270 basis points as we continue to work on both short and long term margin improvement business opportunities heavily focused on the sensor business within the sensor business we followed fourth quarter cost reduction with additional action during the first quarter we also announced the closure of one of our automotive sensor manufacturing plants in europe a more streamlined manufacturing footprint is one of the many actions we re taking to drive margin expansion across our auto sensor business our industrial segment continued to have strong sales progression driving 4 organic growth for the quarter margins were down compared to last year as we had a onetime benefit with the closure of the custom business last year and as the business has grown across new products and geographies our sales mix can vary impacting margins in the quarter the focused portfolio we now have within our industrial segment is aligned with our profitability expectations and continues to show a strong organic growth trajectory looking at cash flow we generated 31 million in operating cash flow for the quarter and 17 million in free cash flow both were lower last year mainly due to lower sales volume impacting earnings along with higher restructuring and interest payments and timing of supplier payments we continued to drive our capital allocation strategy executing on several areas this quarter during the first quarter we repatriated nearly 100 million of cash ending the quarter with over 25 of our cash in the united states we expect to repatriate at least another 100 million during the remainder of the year which gives us ongoing flexibility to execute on our growth strategy our debt levels were unchanged during the quarter with our adjusted growth leverage ending at 1 7x on a total debt to adjusted ebitda basis and under 1 0x on a net basis during the first quarter we repurchased approximately 80 000 shares at an average price of approximately 170 per share since last october we repurchased a total of 472 000 shares at about 173 per share our share buyback authorization expired on april 30 and our board approved a new authorization of 1 million shares through april 30 2020 similar to prior years we ve maintained a consistent share buyback philosophy over the past several years entering the market when we feel our valuation is at a low point this philosophy has served our shareholders well ensuring we optimize returns on our buybacks overall the first quarter played out as we expected reflecting the slower growth market environment our teams remained focus on what we can control delivering value to our shareholders through identifying new growth opportunities while managing costs in a dynamic market environment and with that i ll turn it back over to dave for more color on business performance and market trends dave heinzmann lfus thanks meenal i ll start with our electronics product segment in the first quarter reported sales of 265 million were up slightly with organic sales down 4 while we saw softness across some of our electronics end markets we had success and growth opportunities across appliances and automotive electronics despite a significant decline in global auto production we continue to see channel inventory corrections in response to lower growth rate and excess inventory at end customers our electronics book to bill exited the first quarter was nearing 1 0 an improvement over where we were what we were seeing over 3 months ago we continue to closely monitor distributor point of sales data and inventory levels broad line distributor book to bill for our products was also around 1 0 during the quarter we saw stable demand for our power semiconductor products which have less automotive and distribution exposure however the protection side of the semiconductor business similar to our passives business is more reliant on the distribution channels and was impacted by excess inventory while our channel partners have reduced absolute inventory levels in our product slower end market demand resulted in a static level of weeks of inventory in the channel as we exited the first quarter channel inventories across most of our electronics products remained at the upper end of our normal range which is typically 11 to 14 weeks as a result we expect continued softness with ongoing distributor inventory destocking consistent with our comments in january our long term relationships with our channel partners are a significant factor contributing to our success across our electronics products segment as about 75 of sales in this segment are fulfilled through our distribution partners these relationships jointly drive demand creation end customer partnerships and ultimately collectively drive profitable growth however when the market growth patterns change it does expose us to greater sales volatility historically over 3 to 4 quarters sales can be impacted due to both inventory stocking trends as well as end customer demand we are seeing the impact of this volatility within our electronics products segment we continue to make good progress on our ixys integration effort in 2018 we were focused on expanding our customer relationships and meeting elevated demand requirements resulting in 15 revenue growth at the same time we aligned our resources to begin driving to our 30 million run rate synergy target we made significant progress exceeding our year 1 goal and achieved 40 of the target we are continuing that momentum in 2019 and expect to realize 90 of our target by the end of this year as we look beyond 2019 we expect to meaningfully exceed our 30 million savings target as we continue to identify opportunities to streamline our collective business operations as part of these synergy efforts we completed another round of portfolio rationalization actions during april we sold an rf product line from the ixys portfolio that doesn t align with our long term growth strategy the transaction will not have a material impact on our sales but does emphasize our ongoing focus on synergy realization and optimizing our business also on the ixys front there are several manufacturing rationalization actions we intend to take in a phased approach these long term actions will help us better leverage resources and systems while enhancing capabilities to better serve our customers they are also a key part of exceeding our 30 million synergy target over the next few years we have announced a new facility our third plant at our philippines site our intent is to consolidate most of our european semiconductor assembly and test operations over the next 2 to 3 years in this new plant our ongoing progress integrating the ixys business is on track with our expectations and continues to add value for our customers and shareholders turning to the end markets we serve we continue to see strong design wins in electronification and sophistication continues its momentum and our customers as our customers develop safer greener and more connected products we secured wins for a wide range of applications including telecom for 5g and data centers appliances continue to be a strong end market for us in circuit protection and especially electronic sensor products where you re seeing several quarters of double digit growth we captured design wins for a variety of home automation products and white goods automotive electronics is another good end market where we have made sustained progress we won business for our rearview mirror camera system as well as battery management systems as a wrap up as i wrap up the electronics products segment our competitive advantage is centered around our leadership in circuit protection and growing platforms in power control and sensing technologies the strength of our brand is further reinforced by more than 100 000 end customers we serve each quarter next i will cover our automotive products segment in the first quarter sales of 113 million were down 10 as reported and down 7 organically compared to a car build decline of about the same magnitude we continue to see global content increases for our automotive circuit protection products while our results outpace the production declines in north america and europe in asia in particular in china revenue declines were driven by excess inventory in the channel compared to our protection business our automotive sensor portfolio is more program based independent on tier 1 sell through and end customer take rates it is therefore subject to greater volatility our results in the first quarter reflect this dynamic where we saw customer delays for several major sensor projects and a key tier 1 customer losing a significant program with an oem similar to our protection business in sensors we also saw excess inventory buildup in china looking ahead for automotive product segment we expect continued car build softness during the second quarter volatility in demand persists due to global trade and slower economic conditions in china and europe beyond the near term noise we continue to see meaningful content opportunities across the transportation end markets we serve these are driven by the long term trends of increasing electrification with the transition to hybrids and evs even greater sophistication in the electrical architecture of today s vehicles and continuous advancements in vehicle electronification we continue to prioritize margin improvement across our automotive products segment with a particular focus on the sensor business as meenal noted earlier foreign exchange across this segment was a significant headwind for us slowing our path to improvement this quarter but focusing on what we can control we took further cost reduction actions in the sensor business in this quarter along with the announcement of the closure of one of our european automotive sensor manufacturing sites also as we mentioned previously we are launching several new products and technologies across our sensor business while we re making progress these launches continue to create a near term drag on profitability beyond these short and long term cost reduction actions we are looking broadly at additional profitability improvements across the auto and sensor portfolio on the new business front we continue to gain new design wins across transportation end market as manufacturers remain focused on safer greener and more connected vehicles in the first quarter we secured global design wins in several applications across a spectrum of vehicle types from conventional to hybrid to full ev for example we won new business on emission modules for standardized c engines and ev on vehicle chargers we saw significant design wins for engine cooling and emergency call or e call applications and captured design wins across solar position and temperature sensing applications we also secured another design win in the material handling market one of the strategic growth areas for our commercial vehicle business this win was for a power distribution model module with a large european forklift manufacturer as we wrap up the automotive products segment i wanted to make mention of some well deserved industry recognition for our teams received this quarter our kaunas lithuania and matamoros mexico locations were awarded the prestigious 2018 supplier quality excellence award from general motors this award acknowledges a supplier to meet various stringent quality criteria and is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our global teams to deliver the highest level of quality and service for our customers we re proud of this recognition and look forward to continuing to partner with all our customers around the world finally we will cover our industrial products segment our first quarter sales of 27 million were down 2 due to the exit of a custom business in the third quarter of 2018 organic revenue for the quarter was up 4 we saw stable demand in north america and based on our efforts to expand our presence in other regions we achieved solid growth in asia and europe during the quarter we secured several important design wins with key oems in korea and spain we won business for energy storage application and in japan for a solar power conversion application we also made progress with wins for led lighting and factory automation applications looking ahead given our abundant opportunity pipeline and the consistent customer pool we are seeing our industrial products segment remains poised to outpace industry growth across the end markets we serve we are well positioned to secure business within high growth applications such as alternative energy industrial power conversion mining oil and gas and hvac market forecasts indicate these areas should continue to perform well and we expect to participate in this growth with that i ll call turn the call over to meenal to talk about guidance meenal anil sethna cfo thanks dave onto guidance now as we discussed in january we expected the first half of 2019 was going to be a challenge due to a variety of market factors but we expected to see improving conditions largely in the second half of the year as dave noted the market trends in content opportunities we continue to see aligned to this view with this backdrop we anticipate sales for the second quarter of 2019 of 409 million to 421 million the midpoint of the guidance reflects a 10 decline in reported sales and a 7 organic sales decline versus last year we estimate currency to be about a 2 headwind to sales growth for the quarter we expect second quarter adjusted diluted eps to be in the range of 2 to 2 14 our adjusted eps guidance assumes an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 18 to 19 for the quarter our adjusted eps guidance includes an estimated 0 25 decline from last year due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and mark to market comparisons as well as timing of stock compensation expense sequentially sales growth is projected to be up 2 with adjusted eps growth projected to be 6 at the midpoint of our guidance highlighting the cost improvement efforts that we re driving we are estimating 25 million share 25 million diluted shares for the second quarter which incorporates the shares bought back to date i ll also provide a few additional financial model updates for the full year consistent with the recent trends currencies continue to be a headwind based on current foreign exchange rates for the full year we expect to see about a 1 sales decline from foreign exchange and about 0 50 in adjusted eps decline versus last year due to currency at current interest rates we are estimating interest expense for the year in the range of 22 million to 23 million we expect amortization expense of approximately 40 million for the year we re maintaining our full year 2019 tax rate range in the 18 to 20 range but expect the rate to vary across quarters due to the timing of certain discrete tax items our full year estimate for capital expenditures remains 90 million to 95 million we expect to invest for long term organic growth opportunities as well as the ixys footprint and integration work which is in full swing this year and with that i ll turn it over to dave for some final comments david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director thanks meenal in conclusion you can see by our actions that we remain focused on operational excellence and managing our costs to align to business conditions over the years we have been a proven source of growth and value creation our business fundamentals remain strong and we are well positioned to benefit from the content opportunities driven by the global megatrends of safety energy efficiency and increasing connectivity we will continue to differentiate our company by the consistency reliability and performance we deliver with our circuit protection power control and sensing products in the electronics industrial and transportation end markets we serve i will now turn the call back to the operator for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from shawn harrison with longbow research please proceed shawn matthew harrison longbow research llc analyst good morning the inventory correction that you re seeing in the electronics business based upon the pos you re seeing from distribution now through april do you think you ll be freeing clear that inventory overhang as you move into the second half of the year and get more toward a typical organic growth rate david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director shawn as we discussed in the prepared remarks we did see absolute inventory dollars reduced in the channels with our distribution partners but with sell through the weeks of inventory really didn t move down very much so there s certainly more work to be done in driving that out of the channel but clearly that s impacting and reflected in our guidance in the second quarter our general view is there s a likelihood it leads into the third quarter but certainly begins to improve in the back half of the year pure shawn matthew harrison longbow research llc analyst okay great and then as a follow up is there a way to quantify the actions the non ixys actions you ve taken to improve profitability either be it in the sensors business or other businesses and when you would expect to see the full run rate of those potential profit improvement actions meenal anil sethna cfo yes so shawn as i mentioned also in the prepared remarks we started in the fourth quarter into the first quarter with cost reductions and then also we just recently announced the plant closure i mentioned those take a little bit of time to start to get into the run rate these closures typically take 6 to 9 months to complete by the time you get everything out so i would say you re going to see progressive sequential improvement in the margins that s what we re expecting from the cost actions i think the pieces that are a little bit difficult to predict right now are things like foreign exchange is an example which had a pretty significant headwind for us but we would expect progressive sequential improvement from all the cost actions that we re doing operator and our next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer please proceed christopher glavin oppenheimer analyst thanks hey good morning on the ixys integration comments that process including some footprint stuff in full swing just wondering if we should be thinking about impacts on the profitability of ixys even on an adjusted basis i know you exclude restructuring costs that are made but typically there is redundancies and such david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director well certainly we expect the profitability of the ixys business that we acquired to continue to gradually improve profitability as we put these actions in place as we ve talked about we ve taken some steps on taking out some product lines that really didn t drive margin profiles that we felt were appropriate and didn t fit our strategy and these cost reduction moves also longer term on footprint rationalization will take time to get in place as we talked about we literarily announced recently we re starting construction of a new plant in the philippines that s going to take us 2 to 3 years to get the plant completed the transfer is completed customer approvals and things like that but we certainly believe year to year we will continue to see gains and profitability of the ixys business christopher glavin oppenheimer analyst okay and on the 0 50 of eps impact from fx for the year can you review the mechanics on transactional exposure there overall and then where it hits particularly it sounds like auto meenal anil sethna cfo yes so if i step back bigger picture from the business that we have and where we do business in general we have a long position when it comes to the euro so the weaker euro has hurt us and we have short positions in largely in the countries where we ve got larger manufacturing sites so in places like china where the stronger rmb does hurt us the philippines and mexico so i think with that backdrop with the direction where currencies have moved and moving around a little bit it s the combination of really i d say those 4 currencies that are really causing and i d say the bulk of that being from that euro and the rmb that are really causing that year over year decline and specifically on your question on auto chris when we take a look at our broader i ll call it the sales and the manufacturing footprint auto is probably the most dispersed in terms of sales around the world in multiple currencies and really manufacturing and locations around the world across the entire segment so that s why it tends to get hurt the most from a currency perspective operator and our next question comes from david leiker with baird please proceed david liker baird analyst hi good morning i guess 2 things i d like to dig to they re kind of related i mean if you look at the timing of the stock comp it s headwind here in q2 i mean by definition i think that implies there was a tailwind at some point last year can you help clarify that and as you look at how the q1 and q2 are progressing and if you step back 3 or 4 months can you give us some sense i know you don t give full year guidance but some sense of what that full year looks like obviously currency and production are headwinds but what about the balance of that relative to what you are expecting at the start of the year meenal anil sethna cfo yes so let me take the stock comp piece first so really the stock comp is really a timing issue and if i put it simply for us grants occur in the second quarter of the year and we like many companies have provisions around retirement and age of service and if individuals meet those provisions you ve got we accelerate vesting and so you take expense immediately in the quarter so rather than radically having that expensive spread over multiple years it gets it hits all in one quarter and so that s really that ends up being the timing issue i d say twofold one being second quarter for us tends to have the highest stock compensation expense because of that and as we have some bigger vests that are going on it even front loads expense versus the multiple years of vesting that you have david liker baird analyst but the timing of that is similar to what it would have been in past years is that right meenal anil sethna cfo the timing is similar to past years but we happen to have just some higher we happen to have just with the population that we have we just happen to have more people that fall into that and with some higher dollar amounts year over year david liker baird analyst okay and then if we leave currency and leave the build rates on the side if you look at the rest of the business how would you characterize that that s performing relative to where you expected at the beginning of the year david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes i think i ll take that david i think in general the year is kind of shaping up as we expected going directly into the year we certainly knew that the first half of the year with excess inventories and a bit of a correction in the electronics side of the business was going to be a challenge that we re seeing that maybe it ll take up a little longer than we had hoped to kind of bleed through that maybe again as i mentioned earlier little bit in the third quarter from the automotive standpoint we going into the year had a more pessimistic view on what car build was going to look like in the full year of 2019 than maybe what the agencies were putting out probably pretty consistent though was i think what david your and baird s view is on what car build is so yes kind of shaping out as we expected i do think the amounts of excess inventory in the channels in automotive which normally has not been or has not historically been so much of a headwind in china because of our structure being a little different and a number of small tier 1s and small oems that we serve a lot of that gets served through distribution channels and so there was more excess inventory in the channel in automotive than we would typically have seen and that s probably a bit of a negative surprise for us but we ll work our way through that as car builds pick up in asia operator and our next question comes from matt sheerin with stifel please proceed matt sheerin analyst good morning matt stock comp and the year over year headwinds that 0 25 year over year headwind on eps you talked about stock comp and mark to market and fx could you break that down for us and also kind of elaborate on what that mark to market impact was and what was that meenal anil sethna cfo yes so let me start with your second question so we talked about in various calls that with the accounting rules changed around minority investments that you had and that changed in the beginning of 2018 so you re required the mark to market minority investments that you have and that mark to market runs through that p l so we have a few investments that we ve impact every quarter sometimes end up being materials last year for us we had some positive income that came through and you know we don t forecast that so that ends up being the issue and that s about a 0 05 impact on a year over year basis the stock comp incremental piece on a year over year basis is about 0 09 and then the rest is foreign exchange matt sheerin analyst okay great that s helpful and then back on to the electronics business and the headwinds that you re seeing and the correction one thing i think you did talk about that last quarter was the fact that the pricing has been stable if not firm or up in some cases last year and the thought from other suppliers industry leaders is that volumes come back we re going to be see return to normal more pricing and some pricing pressure are you starting to see that as volumes come back and what s your take on the pricing environment as we go through the year david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director good question matt and yes we talked about last year we probably have more about favorable pricing conditions than we would in a normal year with a strong kind of buildup that was going on and the focus on making sure they had product so we do see that beginning to move back closer on its way toward normal it s not back yet at a stage where we see pricing at kind of our average level particularly in electronics so it s still favorable compared to history but it s becoming unfavorable compared to last year so we our expectation is that kind of work its way back to normal levels over the course of the next maybe 3 or 4 quarters meenal a sethna chief financial officer executive vice president thank you matt operator operator instructions our next question comes from steven fox of cross research please proceed steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst first question was the operating leverage you called out in your for the current quarter the 6 increase in profits versus 2 in sales what are the main drivers quarter over quarter in that leverage and then i have a follow up meenal a sethna chief financial officer executive vice president sure so the 2 and the 6 that i called out was really for the second quarter the 2 growth steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst yes yes that s what i was talking about meenal anil sethna cfo sure so the so when i talked about earlier with some of the questions the stock compensation piece is actually from a timing perspective a sequential perspective that s actually a negative for us and then offsetting that there were some of the operational improvements we ve been talking about it s the continued progression we see in the ixys synergies that are coming through the additional volume that we have the sales volume that helped us from a margin and leverage drop through as well and then overall we ve been talking about the past couple of quarters we re really containing costs in terms of not just variable costs but other discretionary spend et cetera and you re seeing some of the benefits of that steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst great that s helpful and then i have a follow up if it s ok david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director sure steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst in terms of closing the sensor plant i guess i was trying to understand the thought process involved there whether how reactionary it was or strategic and given sort of the uncertain hopefully improving markets and some of the product pruning you seem to have on your operating calendar to do could you pull some of that in or push some of that out are you going to move that around depending on market conditions david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes so in general what s driven us to make the decision to do a plant consolidation and shut down a plant we have a small relatively small sensor manufacturing plant in italy we have a larger factory in lithuania and we also do a lot of sensor manufacturing in mexico so we made the decision to simplifying the footprint for the long term would give us a better and a lower fixed overhead cost structure so we made that decision really for the long term strategy of the business pulling that in pushing that out it s really not related to particular cycles or things like that because as you know in the automotive world when you re making transfers and changes just like that you got to work very closely with customers and get qualifications and go through that process so that really dictates the timing of when you can complete those things other actions that we re looking at in the automotive sensor business clearly in the automotive world you don t move very rapidly with customers without creating problems for customers so we will continue to look at those things and make decisions and take actions as quickly as possible but with respect to what our customers needs and make sure we re supporting our customers as we implement those changes meenal anil sethna cfo thank you steven operator and our next question comes from george godfrey with cl king associates george james godfrey cl king associates analyst it s george i believe you said the organic growth on a sequential basis for q2 about 2 is that right meenal anil sethna cfo yes correct george james godfrey cl king associates analyst okay so if i just annualize that 8 there s no reason to think of 5 to 7 target is off the table is that right meenal a sethna chief financial officer executive vice president i would say we are we re pleased with the fact that we ve been showing sequential growth the past couple of quarters but i would say with a lot of the market dynamics that we ve talked about on the electronics side with the excess inventory sitting in the channel we re still working through that and the other backdrop being automotive the first half being so far down on car builds i think you d be a bit optimistic to assume an 8 growth for the year even on a sequential basis but i think we ve got to see how things really play out the next couple of quarters george james godfrey cl king associates analyst no i was thinking on the 3 year targets that you laid out before the 5 to 7 on i realize any given year could be up or down but those are still on the table correct meenal anil sethna cfo yes i what i look back at is the 5 to 7 is still absolutely there we stand by the 5 to 7 and don t really have any change to that if i take a look at the past couple of years we ve been growing 7 and 8 organically average out to about 8 the past 2 years it s not going to be that when we look at a year over year growth this year but we still feel very good about the long term the 5 year view on our 5 to 7 target that we ve set out to achieve operator and our next question comes from gary prestopino with barrington research please proceed meenal anil sethna cfo good morning gary gary preston pino analyst good when you guys when you reported q4 numbers you were talking about a decline in auto build of 2 to 4 for this year given what s happened in q1 with the auto build has that changed at all in your outlook david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes i think our outlook of full year build remains pretty consistent in that but we do expect it to be down low single digits for the year that s kind of our view and there are a lot of thoughts out there from all the different companies as well as the agencies that produce those forecasts the comps on car build get easier in the back end of the year so it ll certainly show an improvement year over year in the back end of the year compared to last year but i think our view is still that we ll ultimately end up car build down a couple of percentage points gary preston pino analyst okay and then so then that would based on what happened in q1 it would imply that it s got to get better as we go through the year so in terms of what you are seeing there is it going to be basically more a north american based for your business european based china based or is it just the content growth all across the board david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes first of all we certainly continue to see content growth beyond car build globally so that continues to be a good story for us and so we re comfortable with that to kind of continuing storyline from a car build and how things are going to improve going into the back end of the year i would say north america has been kind of relatively stable and we ll see it bounce around stable for our most of the year we don t see that changing dramatically europe we see softening in the second quarter compared to last year clearly but if you remember last year there was kind of a buildout to wltp and then a decline in the back end of the year the big swing will be whether china car build particularly china car build picks up in q3 or ultimately into q4 where they re expecting strong performance there so a lot of it is really dependent on i would say asia being the big swinger operator and we have a follow up from david leiker with baird david liker baird analyst just i guess a couple of other things here if we look at ixys you talked about winning a contract for an onboard charger is that contract win a function of ixys and being able to cross sell that product or something that has been developed in contract 1 organically with what was within littelfuse before david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes actually that specific win we were talking about is actually in our circuit protection business it wasn t with the power semiconductor business but with that said we are seeing good design wins and good activity particularly in asia with ixys power semiconductors being designed into off board charging systems not on board yet we talked about this before ixys really has not had a lot of business in the on vehicle side of the automotive and we re working through readiness on that and we see that long term on the roadmap for us for sure but in the near term the opportunity in the power semi side on the evs is really in the infrastructure side david liker baird analyst okay and then just one other item back on the inventory channel side of the equation particularly on the automotive side i guess more than others we ve heard comments from some other suppliers similar type of environment that you re in that have been talking about those inventories looking closer to more normal inventory levels to what you seem to be suggesting is there any do you have any thoughts on what you might be seeing that s different than what some others might be seeing david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes i can t speak for the exact supply chain that others are seeing in north america and europe for us we have a relatively short supply chain between us and ultimately oem we ship directly to the tier 1s the tier 1s then carry their kind of normal inventory levels into the oems but that operates a bit differently for us in china with several smaller tier 1s in the electrical infrastructure side and a number of oems being served much of that for us we re serving through a distribution channel so there s one more step in the supply chain if you will in china that we don t see in the rest of the world and with that it adds the typical inefficiency of another step in the supply chain and with a lot of strong growth in car build in china for so long i think they were carrying pretty heavy inventory levels to make sure that they could respond to fluctuations in demand from the oems and as car builds came down they ended up having came down very meaningfully particularly with the chinese national oems the amount of inventory they were carrying in the channel is higher and they re bleeding that down so i think i can t speak for others that s a unique thing for us in china specifically that drives the problem operator and our next question is from steven fox with cross research please proceed steven bryant fox cross research llc analyst sorry for the follow up i just want to make sure i was clear on one part of my question dave when you look at product pruning going on is that something that you can sort of manage relative to markets or is that sort of fix given where you are with different end of life commitments david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director yes so specific i think we re talking about automotive sensors on that in the automotive world when we make that decision we want to work our way may be out of a particular area particular application the reality is that does take time because we re not with our ongoing relationships with the automotive customers we re not interested in putting them in a difficult position so we ll communicate with them and work it off over the course of a couple of years to kind of work through those sorts of things in the automotive world whereas in other spaces where we ve done some product pruning in and around the ixys business most of those cases we re able to take faster actions to kind of work our way through that in a year or less than a year operator and our next question is from david sic george james godfrey with cl king associates please proceed george james godfrey cl king associates analyst thank you for taking the fall dave you are quite accurate in providing a little color on what you thought the automotive market would look like this year ahead of time do you have any just curious on your experience any intuitions on what it might look like next year at this point or do you need to be closer to the end of the current year david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director what i i think we would have to be able to closer at the end of the year because it is so much driven by kind of regional economies and things like that it s a little hard for me to predict that what i will say is kind of take us back to comments we ve made before which was we build our strategy over the long term we believe global car build grows at about global gdp which is about 2 on a year over year basis by the way if you look back from 2016 which was about a 5 car build growth and in 2017 at a 2 and you kind of look over the period of time it s kind of end up being about 2 so i don t have any particular insight on what 2020 looks like other than our long term plan continues to build around that 2 or so trisha lee tuntland head of ir thank you for joining us on today s call and your interest in littelfuse we look forward to talking with you again soon have a great day duration 50 minutes call participants trisha lee tuntland head of ir dave heinzmann lfus meenal anil sethna cfo david w heinzmann president chief executive officer director shawn

we retain our target for sensex at 44 000 by march 2020 12 percent upside and any kind of sell off around 5 percent or more should be providing an interesting entry point into equities nitin rao ceo reliance wealth management said in an interview with moneycontrol s kshitij anand edited excerpts story continues below advertisement remove ad q as we close to the election result day volatility has touched a multi year high do you see a sell off or a knee jerk reaction after elections results assuming modi coming back a as we see it the market has partly priced in the return of current administration rallied almost 10 percent from february 2019 lows but still there is room for improvement as election results are a month away if one goes by historical trends markets rally before elections then there is some amount of profit booking and thereafter post election results the market stabilises while there has been a certain amount of re rating in the markets in the last month we expect markets to take a breather before this uptrend continues we retain our target for sensex at 44 000 by march 2020 12 percent upside and any kind of sell off around 5 percent or more should be providing an interesting entry point into equities apart from the noise around elections the market will take cues from the evolving global market developments and upcoming earnings season story continues below advertisement remove ad we have been calling for an earnings recovery and estimate the growth of about 12 percent in fy19 and 20 percent in fy20 for sensex q after the recent rally valuations have gone up for indian markets with event risk in the hindsight where is the pocket of opportunities a after the steep correction seen over the last one year there is valuation comfort in the small and the mid cap space we find value there as broad based profit growth was sparse growth quality at any price had worked very well for the last few years given the run up in the largecap stocks they are now trading at the higher band of valuations to that extent returns expectations from this segment of the market must be rationalized cost effective ways of investing in the largecaps via etfs should be considered we would continue to remain selective in a stock selection where earnings growth is clearly visible most mutual funds seemed to be sitting on cash during the last two months and our sense is that they would be keen to allocate more towards the mid and the smallcap counters in fact our interaction with fund managers indicates that most of them are now aggressively positioning their large and mid category funds to investors q what is pushing the markets higher a we saw a significant foreign selling last year to the tune of 5 6 billion and from a very low base they have begun to come back in cy19 from a year to date ytd perspective fpis have added 8 billion of net equity flows into india while most of the diis have stayed out of this rally in our opinion fpis are taking a long term view on the indian economy structurally over the next five years india is expected to remain amongst the fastest growing world economies most of the forecasts pegging india s gdp growth closer to 7 5 percent a burgeoning middle class with better spending capabilities expected dovishness by the us federal reserve providing comfortable liquidity and green shoots seen in the capex cycle augur well for the equity markets over a 2 3 year time period while your point on crude needs to be further watched we think there are global oil spare capacity and higher inventory levels which could offset any disruption in oil supply due to iranian sanctions etc q what are mistakes that one should avoid especially when benchmark indices are trading near record highs a one needs to never forget that asset allocation remains the cornerstone of any healthy investment portfolio trying not to chase returns or to get exceedingly risk averse is the key to ensuring that the investments made eventually help meet the financial goals they were set to achieve at the onset a regular review of the portfolio weeding out laggards and even taking profits out from investment that has run ahead or delivered their expected returns much sooner should help an investor stay in good stead q i read somewhere that 3es election economy and earnings will decide the direction for markets in the near term i would like to add rupee and crude as well to the list what are your views a brent crude is up 47 percent ytd to 75 per barrel on the back of us sanctions on iranian oil exports such sanctions bite because the us can make life difficult for countries failing to comply given the extent to which america controls flows of dollars around the world iranian exports have halved to between one million to two million barrels a day going to china india south korea japan and turkey waivers allowing these exports were expected to be rolled over which is why the market was surprised by the white house s newly stated resolve to bring iran s oil exports to zero we believe the key opec nations who have been cutting down their oil production would gradually ramp it up to fill up the hole left by iranian sanctions this should help limit the upside to oil prices over the course of the year as for the indian rupee the reserve bank of india rbi has signaled that it intends to keep liquidity at the neutral zone and would use both the bond and foreign exchange fx markets to augment rupee liquidity however with rupee seeing strength on a reer basis rbi can use fx route more than bonds unless the bond curve steepens too far the outlook for fy20 is far more favourable given a relatively benign outlook for commodity prices fading headwinds from the liquidity crunch and relatively stable portfolio inflows while the rupee could remain in the 68 71 range against the us dollar mild depreciation over the medium term can t be ruled out given global growth uncertainty volatile capital flows revival in commodity prices etc q what has been your portfolio strategy a as broad based profit growth was sparse quality at any price had worked very well for the last few years with a positive change in margin growth likely to become more dispersed the trend is undergoing a change providing buying opportunities we would continue to select stocks where earnings growth is clearly visible over the last few months we had called for advancing equity allocation prior to elections for those who missed allocating to equities any market consolidation should be used to fill the allocation gap after the steep correction seen over the last one year there is valuation comfort in the small and midcaps we find value there given the run up in large cap stocks they are trading at the higher band of valuations to that extent returns expectations from this segment of the market must be rationalized also cost effective ways of investing in large caps via etfs should be considered q do you think fii momentum will continue if we see modi coming back a fiis have added over 8 billion ytd coming out of an unfavourable year we believe the fiis are betting on the long term india growth story while we are not experts to predict elections if there is a return of the current government it would only act as a catalyst in front loading some of these flows currently most of the fii flows into india have been a part of the emerging market em focused funds and not necessarily in india focused etfs alone a stable administration at the centre could see india focused etfs also attract flows given our views on other macro factors that we discussed we see fii flows sustaining in indian equities q global markets are also trading near highs does it make sense to invest in funds that have global exposure to diversify the portfolio a breaking the home bias should help the investor of today to build a portfolio that offers truly a better risk adjusted portfolio most of us would have seen the heat map on indian asset classes that clearly corroborate the fact that winners rotate if we zoom out a bit and compare indian markets to its global counterparts the narrative doesn t change much different asset classes different economies perform at different points in time global markets offer exciting thematic options to choose from agri focused global commodities focused energy gold mining country specific em focused etc indian investor generally doesn t get the exposure to such a diverse range of themes in the domestic market from this point of view too within global allocation investors can look to optimise the risk returns profile of their portfolio these themes could be short lived and could involve active management disclaimer the views and

our investor relations website we will post these prepared remarks on our investor relations website following the completion of the call with that i ll now turn the call over to valentin valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board good morning everyone we were pleased to deliver first quarter results in line with our guidance given the challenging macroeconomic geopolitical and competitive backdrop during the quarter business trends improved in china driving sequential growth in orders more importantly we have met competitive challenges head on substantially reducing component and manufacturing costs we have also introduced unmatched product features that improve processing speed flexibility and quality for our customers ipg always seeks to gain advantage during times of market stress if properly executed these challenging times can be a catalyst for r d investment that results in a stronger competitive position on which excess returns can be earned we remain the clear market leader in fiber lasers with hundreds of megawatts of installed capacity in the first quarter we shipped more than 11 megawatts of total optical power up nearly 10 year over year high power megawatts increased even more nearly 15 year over year although we have seen aggressive pricing among china based competition for 1 kilowatt to 4 kilowatts lasers serving the low cost cutting market we increased sales of our rack mounted lasers sequentially with even stronger unit growth the pricing environment has affected the dollar value of units serving this market however our ability to rapidly reduce costs has limited the gross margin impact to just 200 basis points year over year last year we reduced the cost of diodes essentially and some other components by more than 15 and have started the mass production of new diodes in q1 this year we have visibility into further cost reductions and product enhancements that we believe extend our competitive lead in the last few quarters we have developed and couple of weeks ago have started to sell to customers new unique 2 kilowatts to 4 kilowatts qcw lasers with double peak power additional capability this innovation essentially enhances our competitive position in the cutting market the lasers increase piercing speed improved cut quality delivering cleaner more controlled drilling of thicker materials while reducing scrap it is an enormous advantage to compare to competitive lasers of other chinese guys and will give us a very big improvement in sales this year at ultra high power sector our multiple ipg customers will shortly be launching their first 20 kilowatt laser cutting systems raising the bar for speed and flexibility in processing thicker metals versus non laser technologies in addition we see compelling customer interest in our new generation of high power lasers with adjustable mode beam capability that permits reliable adjustment of the output beam to process a wider range of material thicknesses for cutting applications while reducing spatter and improving quality in welding applications we also made solid progress in our newest product areas outside metal processing sales of green pulsed lasers for example used to improve solar cell efficiency more than doubled year over year we also made a fast growth in the sale of our red blue and other new products we increased sales of our ultrafast pulsed lasers nearly three times compared with the prior year and are actively working on more than 50 new projects for these lasers across a wide range of applications systems sales increased more than 200 and the acquisition of genesis allows ipg to accelerate laser processing within the transportation agriculture aerospace and industrial end markets sales of beam delivery accessories increased more than 70 year over year we increased sales of our laser based cinema projection system more than 150 year over year as our solution is being adopted at three of the leading providers of cinema projection technology we also have visibility into strong growth in medical laser solutions this year collectively sales of newer laser products and systems into emerging applications grew at double digit rate in the first quarter and were 15 of total revenue we continue to demonstrate meaningful traction in ultra high power fiber lasers while investing in new products and applications we believe this progress substantially expands our addressable market and opens up opportunities that will drive the company s growth for many years our mission is to make ipg s fiber laser technology the tool of choice in mass production for many years ahead i am confident in our ability to execute on this mission and deliver superior returns with that i ll turn the call over to tim timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president thank you valentin and good morning everyone revenue in the first quarter declined 12 year over year to 315 million revenue from materials processing applications decreased 11 year over year and revenue from other applications decreased 32 due to the timing of orders in our advanced applications and communications businesses by region first quarter revenue in china decreased 24 year over year and represented approximately 36 of the total macro driven softness in cutting and marking applications was partially offset by growth in macro welding within china sales of ultra high power cw lasers grew by a double digit percentage but were more than offset by declining sales of lasers for lower power applications in europe revenue decreased 24 year over year primarily due to softness in cutting and additive manufacturing partially offset by growth in welding in europe total sales of 88 million were consistent with the q3 2018 level which supports our previous assertion that revenue in the region appears to have stabilized however continued macroeconomic softness in the region as evidenced by the decline in eurozone manufacturing pmi makes predicting an eventual rebound in europe more challenging in north america revenue increased 65 year over year driven by the acquisition of genesis excluding genesis sales in north america increased 1 year over year with slight declines in cutting welding and marking offset by strength in other products and applications sales in japan decreased 20 year over year on softness in marking welding and cutting however strong bookings in the region suggest improved performance in japan during the second quarter sales in korea increased 4 and revenue in turkey decreased 36 year over year but improved sequentially turning to performance by product high power cw laser sales decreased 22 year over year and represented approximately 57 of total revenue reduced sales of high power cw lasers for cutting and additive manufacturing were partially offset by strength in welding applications sales of ultra high power fiber lasers at 6 kilowatts or greater accounted for nearly 50 of all high power laser sales driven by rapid adoption in cutting applications sales of lasers at 10 kilowatts or greater increased more than 40 year over year while sales of other high power lasers declined year over year due to the weaker demand environment in china and europe and more aggressive price reductions on select products pulsed lasers sales decreased 18 year over year with rapid growth in green and ultrafast pulsed lasers offset by reduced sales of other pulsed products medium and low power laser sales decreased 39 on softness in additive manufacturing and the transition to kilowatt scale lasers in cutting qcw sales declined 13 year over year but increased 17 on a sequential basis as lower sales into consumer electronics applications was partially offset by increased sales of higher power qcw lasers into other applications systems sales increased 245 year over year due to the acquisition of genesis excluding genesis systems sales increased nearly 20 year over year driven by growth in macrosystems for welding drilling and ablation applications along with the initial acceptance of our laser based cinema projection system at leading providers of cinema projection technology other product sales increased 6 year over year driven by growth in beam delivery accessories and service revenue gross margin of 47 3 declined 920 basis points from the first quarter of 2018 compared with the year ago period less favorable absorption of manufacturing expenses reduced gross margin by nearly 500 basis points lower than expected absorption of manufacturing expenses and a higher inventory provision resulted in gross margin coming in slightly below the low end of our expected q1 range in addition acquisitions reduced gross margin by more than 200 basis points and lower product pricing and foreign exchange headwinds reduced gross margin by a further 200 basis points approximately holding other factors constant we believe that recovery in our business to approximately 380 million in quarterly sales would enable us to get close to the mid point of our long term gross margin guidance of 50 to 55 first quarter operating income was 68 million or 21 7 of sales down 1 750 basis points from the first quarter of 2018 excluding a foreign exchange loss of 2 million operating margin was 22 2 excluding foreign exchange operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 630 basis points year over year due to lower revenue investments in engineers salespeople and it systems higher r d material costs and higher than normal legal expenses net income was 55 million and earnings per diluted share were 1 02 slightly lower than expected absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and a higher inventory provision reduced eps by 0 04 relative to guidance in addition higher r d material expenses legal costs and foreign exchange losses reduced eps by 0 04 if exchange rates relative to the us dollar had been the same as one year ago we would have expected revenue to be 15 million higher and gross profit to be 8 million higher the effective tax rate in the quarter was 24 which included certain discrete tax items we ended the quarter with cash cash equivalents and short term investments of 1 03 billion and total debt of 44 million cash provided by operations was 46 million during the quarter operating cash flow was reduced by cash tax payments that totaled more than 50 million relative to a q1 tax provision of 17 million these payments were primarily related to the timing of cash taxes paid in germany with the filing of our 2017 tax return in q4 2018 capital expenditures were 33 million which included approximately 21 million for the purchase of a new facility in massachusetts as we continue to invest in new plants and equipment to meet demand for our products over the next several years turning to guidance we have seen further signs of improving business conditions in china our largest region with sequential growth in orders and good momentum through the first three weeks of the second quarter our first quarter book to bill ratio was above one in line with normal seasonality albeit off a lower base given the weaker macroeconomic environment if this momentum in china is maintained it should continue to drive better performance performance in europe is generally stable but down from peak levels reflecting reported economic trends in the region we expect pricing headwinds relative to competition in china to continue we believe our innovative new products accessories and complete solutions would provide customers with a superior value proposition both cement and enhance our market leadership position based on these factors for the second quarter of 2019 we expect revenue of 340 million to 370 million we expect our second quarter tax rate to be approximately 25 and we anticipate delivering earnings per diluted share in the range of 1 25 to 1 55 commentary from our largest machine tool oem customers continues to improve but we do not yet have clear visibility into their full year order plans as such we do not believe it is appropriate to provide full year revenue guidance at this time as a reminder we would expect year over year trends to improve in the back half of 2019 driven by market recovery and strength in new products and solutions as discussed in the safe harbor passage of today s earnings press release actual results may differ from our guidance due to factors including but not limited to product demand order cancellations and delays competition tariffs trade policies and general economic conditions our guidance is based upon current market conditions and expectations assumes exchange rates referenced in our earnings press release and is subject to risks outlined in the company s reports with the sec and with that valentin and i will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jim ricchiuti from needham company please proceed with your question james ricchiuti needham company analyst hi thank you tim when you talked about the 200 basis points impact on gross margins from acquisitions was that all genesis related timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president yes james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay so genesis was about 21 million of revenues in the quarter timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president we said 24 million in the press release james ricchiuti needham company analyst oh i m sorry okay timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president in line with that james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay just as it relates to what you re seeing in the market in china are you hearing anything from your customers that give you any view of a pickup or on the other hand weakness in consumer electronics related revenues timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president we re not hearing anything that s going to drive a very significant pickup but there is some demand for consumer electronics applications we re seeing some order flow for some of the micro welding applications with our qcw lasers we ve been asked to deliver some product with very short lead times for that continuing to work on some of the higher power applications for welding the frame around different phones but yes this year i don t think is going to be a significant consumer electronics revenue driver as some of the biannual cycles are and i think there s another company that reported last night that reflected that as well so there s some order flow but it s certainly not a bullish tone around consumer electronics in general james ricchiuti needham company analyst understood and then just a clarification and i ll jump back in the queue the book to bill of 1 0 were you referencing china or were you talking about book to bill across the various regions timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president in total china was also up above 1 there as well james ricchiuti needham company analyst okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of tom diffely from d a davidson please proceed with your question tom diffely d a davidson analyst yes good morning i was curious you talked about how you ve been able to offset some of the pricing with some of the new features i m curious what type of features is the most successful is it speed reliability or specific tech specs what do you find the most successful in fighting off some of the pricing pressure timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so tom first of all i think really what has offset some of the pricing pressure has been this very significant reduction in component and sub assembly cost with the new generation of diodes and relative to the pricing pressure we ve seen only seeing 200 basis points in margin degradation related specifically to pricing i think is really quite extraordinary in terms of some of the product features we ve introduced in for the cutting applications i think the qcw feature with the 2 times peak power because of the improvement in piercing speed quality of piercing the fact that the cutting can then start closer to the edge of the metal and reduce scrap is going to be a very fundamentally important feature to have with the lasers and on the adjustable mode beam i think there s good work being done with customers i say there s a lot more excitement around the qcw feature which is actually good for us because that s very unique to ipg several other customers offer the variable beam capability but qcw is really unique to ipg tom diffely d a davidson analyst and then maybe getting back to the cost reduction side i mean you guys have been very good over the last decade of reducing the cost is this a continuous opportunity for you or at some point do you run out of ways to reduce the cost timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president i mean valentin keeps driving everybody every year to get to cost reductions and if you just looked at say the cost of an individual component you might be reaching greater limits on being able to reduce that but if you can then take that and get more power out of individual components that as much as anything else can bring your cost per watt down as you get more power out of the components it can also simplify the product architecture reduce the number of splices for example that are required in the manufacturing process reduces the form factor of the lasers that in itself takes cost out so every year we take cost out and think it s going to become more difficult and then we succeed yet again to take a significant amount of cost out tom diffely d a davidson analyst great and then finally when you talked about the pricing timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president valentin will add a comment around that just before you go in valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board i would say with diode for example for last six years we decreased cost of 1 watt of diode decreased more than 10 times during six years 10 times decreased cost of diode now nobody can compete with that inaudible it s a fantastic result which 10 years ago the biggest scientists that they dream only about that possibly in future someone will have reached such numbers and we have produced now about more than 70 megawatts of optical power 70 megawatts ask all together who produce diode maybe only few megawatts only we produced 70 megawatts who are able to compete in quantity how many years they need to invest to reach such number but without this diode nobody can practically win with us to replace us in the market nobody able even to cross us in the market such number only diode but all other components fall for the quantity of different kinds of lasers only poses now competition changes and so on it s only for a couple of lasers 1 micron of lasers only will go power up to 2 kilowatts to 3 kilowatts but equality no question inaudible but even quality they ll never able even to reach our number this price correction was a very tough decision of course it s damaged the market very essential price but when you talk about quantity for them laser high power laser 1 kilowatt price we increase each year we increased up to 20 up to now every year we increased 22 units price the decrease of price you take one time aggressive one year two years then finished they could not grow price up to new and now they are making inaudible with this without moving margin practical but they have to stop but quantity every year we increase quantity 15 20 up to now we did not lose market share whole time we increased market share tom diffely d a davidson analyst great thanks for the extra color finally tim when you look at the pricing pressure that you ve seen is that you responding to market pricing or is it you getting aggressive on pricing to regain or retain share timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president market pricing has been very aggressive as valentin s referenced we think that we can see that it started to stabilize a bit to a degree we have to respond to it but we re still pricing at a premium to the market given our improved quality and performance of the lasers for example with electrical efficiency the size general reliability of the product and now with the new feature sets we believe some of these features will enable us to add value around the product and enhance that pricing a little bit relative to where the competition is tom diffely d a davidson analyst great thank you for your time operator our next question comes from the line of patrick ho with stifel please proceed with your questions patrick ho stifel nicolaus analyst thank you very much tim maybe first off just following up on the strong performance you had in the ultra high powered segment on a year to year basis i guess from a big picture basis where do you believe we re in in the industry transition to these higher powered lasers particularly for the cutting market are we still at the very early stage of say like first or second inning or are we kind of halfway through i guess this industry shift timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president it s still a relatively early stage i think it depends what power level you re talking about in the 6 kilowatts to 10 kilowatt range the first use of those lasers started a couple of years ago in 10 kilowatts to 15 kilowatts it s only really that transition happened started to happen over the last year and at 20 kilowatts as we referenced people are only just starting to introduce cutting systems at that kind of power level so it s the higher power you get the more recent the transitions are to utilizing higher power scale devices patrick ho stifel nicolaus analyst great and as my follow up question in terms of the improved outlook that you re starting to see in china is part of that related to a better inventory situation therein where they worked off maybe some of the excess laser inventory they have or is it being driven by i guess a turn in demand timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so we don t think that there s at any time a huge amount of inventory that sits with the oems in part that s because of the way we manage the business right we have very short lead times we don t force product on people when they see fluctuations in demand so what we re seeing here there may be a little bit of an inventory adjustment but it s not i do not believe it s the primary driver the primary driver has been a shift in the demand cycle coming back and we referenced that even in q1 so we started to make a bit of a call on our first quarter earnings announcement now the bookings forecast for china in q2 would doesn t just reflect an inventory adjustment that reflects a very definitive pickup in demand and that reflects i think the effective some of the stimulus and other actions that have been taken locally to get to i think a softer landing than might otherwise have happened patrick ho stifel nicolaus analyst great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of david ryzhik from susquehanna please proceed with your question david ryzhik susquehanna international group analyst hi thanks so much for taking the question so regarding the 6 kilowatt or above high power lasers in your prepared remarks i guess the numbers would shake out to around flat year over year growth in q1 and china grew double digits in this segment so that would suggest the rest of the world declined year over year i just wanted to get your sense on what are the demand trends for 6 kilowatt and above ex china and what you saw there in q1 and then i have a follow up thanks timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president yes absolutely i mean it s clear that relative peak revenue in europe was actually in q1 a year ago and a lot of that was coming off the initial transition toward more than 6 kilowatt power lasers so europe as we said compared to that peak continues to be weak but it has stabilized at least right revenue is tracking along over the last three quarters at relatively the same level but it s still significantly off the peak demand that we saw at the beginning of the year that would be the main driver in q1 japan was also a little bit weak but order flow from some of the main oems started to pick up at the end of the quarter and we re going to see an improvement in high power laser demand in japan in q2 and their bookings forecast is also good so that trend should happen into q3 korea was ok with high power lasers the cutting applications not brilliant but they ve got a good forecast as well for the second quarter so yes ex china particularly the largest market where we serve is europe that certainly is off from continues to be off from peak demand a year ago david ryzhik susquehanna international group analyst okay thanks and just regarding ultrafast you talked about sales up 3x you re working on more than 15 new products would love to perhaps you can expand upon your strategy there how you view the market opportunity perhaps what kind of revenue run rate you think you can get to over the next few years would really appreciate that thank you timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so it s actually we re working on about 50 projects with different customers and we believe we ve got a very an excellent device that is compact it has a very fast start up time from a cold it has very good electrical efficiency we re working on continuing to improve the amount of energy and the average power that we can get out of the device so that we can address more and more applications at a very high level i think that s the main strategy and then really pushing the product out to customers for evaluation in processing of many different types of materials it s certainly a product that has got a lot of very positive feedback from customers we re not getting back into specific run rate around ultrafast lasers if we look at the micro processing and look at ultrafast and uv and some of the visible product offerings the total revenue around that is actually starting to approach a just below a 10 million quarterly run rate so getting up toward a 40 million annual run rate and that s really starting to get to be more meaningful therefore so 2 or 3 of revenue we said get to 5 and 10 of revenue first and then gain another 500 basis points a share you can quickly see yourselves heading toward 100 million to 150 million of total revenue quite quickly valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board and i can tell you with ultrafast lasers we will introduce multi laser with all fiber with a reasonable power source first laser all other customers have provided very bulky expensive and not flexible solid state solution it is not fiber solution we provide now a 50 watt home fiber placed in the market with the two years we re qualifying and the customer also testing and so on so inaudible request for oem customers we ve started to only one month ago one month ago therefore it s particular process qualification testing and so on but returns from the market is therefore so excellent own people sell their wire much much better when they use now from other sources and so it s but only start to save so the reo overall the reo it would be we expect next year reo multiple speakers david ryzhik susquehanna international group analyst thank you so much for the color valentin and tim quick follow up do you feel like you need to invest in sg a and r d should we expect some pickup in investments related to this opportunity timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president on the r d side i think we re continuing to invest in r d and devoting the resources that we need to get the product to market we haven t seen any decreases in r d through the downturn on sg a we ve added headcount around that area that s starting to execute we of course look for people who are more specialized in this area as we build the business but we tend not to go and chase like 100 people to build that market we look for the best people who are technically competent and have a deep knowledge based around the different users in the market and leverage them to get a return quickly on the sales cycle for that so we re not looking to add 100 salespeople to get into the ultrafast market david ryzhik susquehanna international group analyst thank you very much appreciate that operator our next question comes from the line of andrew degasperi from berenberg please proceed with your question andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets analyst thanks for taking my questions first on the welding side i know that china s cut their subsidies in april for ev i m just wondering if there s any impact that you see yet on sales from that end timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president we haven t seen anything specific related to change in ev demand we continue to work on different projects some of them are not even just related to china demand they re related to some of the international automotive companies installing battery capacity in china so i think it s too soon to make a call on whether there s removal of the subsidies or cutting of them in april what the impact of them will be it s certainly not we would have liked to see the subsidies stay because it s going to be a bit of a negative andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets analyst got it and then secondly just on the pricing side as a follow up is are you seeing anything in terms of competition moving in the mid power range i mean we ve been hearing that your chinese competitors are trying to improve the reliability of their lasers in the 5 to 6 kilowatt just wondering if you re seeing anything on that side timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president nothing material i think of course they re all trying to get there but valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board they don t have a good chance for this to improve there you have to understand with increase of power it d be you watch your problem growing very fast but even all our tests could make personal test newest version of this competition also for example so the earlier what inaudible minimum two three times batteries per year we need for three years minimum making one third there you will have two or three even on lower power 1 kilowatt 2 kilowatt five six and so inaudible they are magical with there so how would they improve nearest time nearest year we don t see any opportunity andrew degasperi berenberg capital markets analyst great thank you valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board so you know what we have for a diode 10 times value of them all represent given their breadth over there inaudible it was sort of perhaps the inventor perhaps creator of high powered diodes now we inaudible going out of this business because it s not competitive i would say not chinese not chinese operator our next question comes from the line of joe wittine from edgewater research please proceed with your question joe wittine edgewater research analyst hi thanks with respect to the full year we have started to hear some global integrators willing to quantify a 2019 outlook certainly more than we saw 90 days ago you obviously aren t hearing enough to publicly quantify a range which i get but maybe talk us through any notable forecast you have heard or any regional details you may be hearing and for those that are tight lipped maybe what are they telling you that they re waiting on before giving a more definitive look into the full year is it specific down market verticals is it geopolitical et cetera thanks timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so i think yes joe a couple of the oems have come up and given some generic information about what they expect for the year and then one example of those that customers a large but not even our largest customer and although very important the business is much more one dimensional than ours so focused on 2d cutting whereas we ve got a much more diversified set of applications and end markets i think we look at this and our annual guidance even a less volatile environment is tricky what we have been saying and are continuing to see is a nice recovery and even strength in overall bookings with a strong bookings forecast for q2 particularly in china as i referenced and that s being provided by the sales group we expect that to continue assessing that i don t want to it gets a bit difficult to give anything specific but if you look at q3 for example consensus i think looks pretty reasonable i think rsus we just don t have visibility into q4 yet we re struggling a little bit look at how changeable the macro environment is one month ago europe looked like a basket case and yet only today the data in europe looks a lot stronger so we re certainly seeing some very positive trends on the business it s just a bit early to get out there and give an annual guidance on it and we hope to see this momentum continue if they achieve the bookings forecast they got for q2 we re going to see a really nice recovery in the business so we re waiting on seeing that happening joe wittine edgewater research analyst okay makes sense and then just as a follow up on china you kind of presented it as a tale of two worlds ultra high power cw is up but then low power applications are facing some headwinds on the ultra high power cw can you confirm whether that s six and up or 10 and up and then on the low power weakness is that competition related or is that more demand related the declines that you re seeing thanks timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president on the ultra high power we certainly are seeing a lot of strength in 10 and up a little bit less than six the low end of the market has in total units has continued to perform ok but it s really sort of more of a pricing impact at the lower end of the market that s affecting things so that market hasn t gone it s not 20 down it s more on a pricing issue there the competition is also a lot stronger at that level so we think together with some of these new features particularly the qcw feature on the lasers will be a substantial enhancement the smaller form factors of these lasers also will be of a benefit to the end market relative to the chinese competition valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board not only it s smaller but also it is much more functionality for that much more and much more efficient but much more additional functionality property and so on which you know this people only claim that they have the five or 10 kilowatt laser our competitor but if compare the lasers we don t see in the exhibition we don t see it on own laser it has done it so on and so on where is this laser we have to inaudible hear from customers who use these lasers it s only a why more than marketing tricks it s not seriously one to talk about we have produced 10 kilowatt of laser now of about 1 000 1 000 lasers today how many they produce maybe less than 10 it s only for a while it s not still laser not marketing tool it s only a marketing trick more clearly when we were in inaudible we tried to achieve inaudible laser machine sold what they sold is not 10 kilowatts at all absolutely we re not because this is not 10 we ve got we ve got even heating they need water five times more water only to heat to cool them but they don t have any claim even pipes at all for this so it s inaudible five pipes maybe again cool only two three kilowatts but not 10 never 10 joe wittine edgewater research analyst thanks everyone operator our next question comes from the line of mark miller with the benchmark company please proceed with your question mark miller the benchmark company analyst don t want to overdo this but in terms of the ultra high power some people have announced products recently and are you seeing any increased competition or is that still your own playing field timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president mark i don t have a very definitive answer on his view of what their capabilities in that area just now so there is nothing else to add on it we just don t believe that they are anywhere close to us but yes they announced that but they just don t have competing product that is getting any meaningful traction in the market mark miller the benchmark company analyst and you mentioned ultra fast and green lasers did well last quarter can you estimate what percent of sales are coming from new products last quarter timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president yes in total new products are driving about 15 of sales and grew at a double digit rate and there s a whole variety of new products in there including the ultra fast green the visible some of our higher power pulsed systems accessories which includes the beam delivery stuff so about 15 to total revenue mark miller the benchmark company analyst thank you valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board keep in mind only green lasers we have now more than 15 different kinds of types lasers with different functionality most of them unique nobody able to reproduce and to provide the same quality the same performance at all it s unique version of lasers and more and more people started to take this and they found it fantastic laser now several folks have started to make green lasers because they thought big opportunities claim about we don t see any competition only some application around mark miller the benchmark company analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of alex chang with citigroup please proceed with your question alex chang citigroup analyst thanks for taking my questions i have one question regarding to china s sales actually we have seen the major customer in china deliver around 26 yoy sales in the first quarter also your major competitors in china also deliver about 20 you know revenue growth but your revenue from china was 20 decline how can we understand this i mean how much is from the changing impact how much is from asp or unit sales timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so alex this is a relatively easy question to answer we ve done a research into it we actually had a very strong quarter in q1 2018 in china with our main oems and if you looked at the main oem revenue most of them went from q1 to q2 with a doubling of revenue so their sales from ipg were in the prior quarter ahead of that growth that we had a really exceptional quarter so relative to that our q1 this year looks weaker but we re starting to see improving demand trends i mean the main oem out there that is our largest customer they reported revenue doubled from q1 to q2 and that was their peak they don t they re buying lasers ahead of that for us so of course there is some impact on it on pricing that we ve referenced that the total unit sales across the board performing quite nicely we re starting to get real traction at 10 killowatts and more but it s really a it s a timing difference that appears to create normally between the way they re performing and not so they had a relatively weak q1 a year ago and those shows some more solid performance relative to that but we ve got a very different timing difference to deal with alex chang citigroup analyst understood my follow up question is about your new product with qcw feature as you mentioned the qcw is meaningful for the consumer electronics applications so how much contribution from this new product do you expect for this year and apart from the consumer electronics what other applications would these new products that are in for timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president just want to be clear the older qcw generation of lasers was an exclusively qcw feature that was targeting the micro cutting and welding applications in consumer electronics the new qcw feature where we get two times the energy out of a cw laser incorporates and combines that feature with a normal continuous wave laser the additional peak power is what really helps within the cutting applications for reducing testing time improving the quality of the testing as well as enabling the oem to start cutting nearer to the edge of the metal reducing scrap so it s an entirely different feature that s enabled by ipg s new generation of diodes which can run both in cw and qcw feature or mode rather we can explain that to you a little more detail afterwards if you aren t clear on it valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board yes in terms so with the new qcw laser it s not the same we had before it s much more powerful and area we ll provide ways to good improvement and catching it all if you inaudible chinese not able to make something similar at all and not only now but year over year one reason we used our diodes they work with five times more peak power then able to work diode from any other source not only from chinese made but made by any other customer manufacturing worldwide our diodes provides so many properties only with such diodes can make a efficient such kind of fiber laser alex chang citigroup analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of tom hayes with northcoast research please proceed with your question tom hayes northcoast research analyst thank you good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my question maybe just wanted to follow up you had mentioned several times in your prepared remarks on the weakness in the additive manufacturing space just wanted to get some thoughts on kind of that market and the outlook for the year timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president it started to improve a little bit but it hasn t got the same traction it had in the end of 2017 and into the first two or even the first quarter of 2018 so the order flow is trying to pick up it s certainly not at the level it was a year ago yet tom hayes northcoast research analyst okay and then just maybe on north america i think you said when you factored genesis out the north american revenue was up about 1 anything strikingly as far as that outlook timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so some of the other business in north america the advanced applications and the telecommunications are just primarily here it was probably the weakest part of that the interesting thing there is on advanced applications we had very strong orders in q1 for a couple of the applications there so that revenue will start to pick up the communications outlook has a bit more of an improvement coming into q2 but i d say we were actually really pleased with the advanced application order flow in q1 so it s really more of a timing issue there and it s once application of after many 10th year of development of laser devices for the practical use now they have started to ask so they will now invest some practical applications so volume and set of few units start to grow by 10 by 100 in revenue it would be a bigger loss and we many years started them for this development now so in a way i expect both the year both are for real practical or field use operator our next question comes from the line of michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah thanks thanks guys for taking my question tim just a point clarity the 380 million of quarterly sales to get to the midpoint of gross margin does that include genesis or exclude genesis timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president no including so you re kind of getting backup of 350 with the laser business michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst perfect thanks and can you help frame the puts and takes for us in terms of this gross margin trajectory so i believe in the second half of last year you had some significant headwinds there was currency the price reset utilization rates were moving lower how should we think about moving into the second half where are utilization rates kind of trending now can we see diode savings flow through the p l more so in the second half and maybe talk currency timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president so even with the first generation of the new type of diode you saw some benefit in that last year as i referenced i think it s actually it s amazing that when you look at the model only 200 basis points of the margin degradation really specifically relates to pricing the cost of the bill of material has come down already very significantly balance in reference there is the next generation of this higher power diode coming onstream that started to be used in the first quarter we started to use it not exclusively so that will continue to benefit the cost of product through the year so that s still got to fully flow through so that should help a little bit with gross margin the key thing outside of that is really to get back to an absorption a better absorption rates on fixed cost because that as i mentioned is 500 basis points of the difference relative to our year ago gross margins so recovering that puts you closer to the midpoint of the 50 to 55 range it would actually put the laser revenue if you exclude the acquisition in the upper half of that range because the acquisition is a bit of a dilutive impact to that so that would be very good right now exchange rates are still a bit of a headwind we referenced that they took 15 million out of revenue for the first quarter the chinese yuan is still at a lower level than it was in q1 and q2 when it kind of peaked at cny6 3 and it s cny6 5 ph the last couple of days but it s cny6 7 the euro is weaker than it was a year ago it was at 1 12 this morning so it s up from 1 17 to 1 20 that it was in the first half of last year so fx is still a bit of a headwind we re dealing with mark miller the benchmark company analyst fair enough and this is this question is not necessarily on q2 but if credit improves the trade tensions ease and the macro just stabilizes do you see some signs of a replacement cycle for laser systems in the second half or 2020 that can kind of provide us support of revenue i know growth has been weak the last three quarters but if we take a step back you ve grown revenue at a 25 cagr over the last decade is there signs that the installed base is aging and we could see some replacement timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president i don t have an update specifically to give you a definitive answer on that certainly some of the some of the higher power devices are more than a decade old so we re probably seeing some replacement cycle the real increase in high power volume though started five years ago so we re still a couple of we ve always said a couple of years off from a real ramp potentially in a replacement cycle for that i mean 2014 15 was when we started to see very significant growth in the high power lasers so those lasers are not yet at the end of their life cycle certainly some of the stuff in 2010 or 11 i mean our electrical efficiency back then was significantly below where it is now our form factor was a lot bigger the quality of the device even though it was very good doesn t match what we have today so there is some replacement probably going on it s not a huge amount we d be looking for continued displacement of non laser applications as the investment cycle picked up right as people look to invest in new equipment they would consider a laser based system now where historically they may have been looking at a non laser based application valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board yes before the people inaudible for example for very thick metal inaudible for example the plasma cutting and the laser cutting where the cutting was better but still not for thick metal now we provide them very thick metal cutting opportunity and cost per meter is now with laser much cheaper than plasma so they start to request plasma also water cutting and many others they replace now only also only start to request e beam inaudible for example now we the way we process for laser cutting version of this many metals thick metals and also on titanium and so on inaudible excellent fantastic new opportunities inaudible instead of e beam but people are going where it s a low but it s real where do you watch the market would be near is 3 5 years where do you watch market if only ipg developed now a new generation this year we introduced a new generation 1 to 20 kilowatt laser 2 times cheaper than before and much more compact easy to use very simple inaudible operator now never before it was given one year ago we had much more bulky and much more expensive lasers now we produce very nice quality very compact efficient easy to use very light lasers immediate where many people from plasma and other stuff from laser but nobody able to provide the same at all and nobody would be able not even chinese no inaudible nobody could try to make fiber laser and high power nobody have been able to make the same michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president and michael the other point to take on that is that there is still tens of thousands of co2 lasers that require replacing in the market installed base of co2 laser is still 60 000 or 70 000 lasers despite the penetration of fiber into the market and as you see the global economy if it does stabilize or even improve and credit cycles improve that may be a source of demand that would be the benefit over the next 12 months to 18 months michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah that makes sense and just lastly i mean you mentioned like when someone asked before about consumer electronics it s you mentioned it s usually a biannual cycle so 2018 last year was a very difficult year and you even hinted this year and some of some peers this year is going to be challenged as well so that s kind of two years of a down cycle there so how far is your consumer electronics business kind of down from that 2017 level and then if you think of 2020 with some introductions of models a potential recovery in smartphones i m just trying to gauge do you think laser processing in that application could increase kind of cycle over cycle do you see room for that to kind of improve if we do see 2020 that type of recovery that some people expect in that market thanks timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president yeah i mean consumer electronics you d expect this year because of the biannual product cycle to be stronger w just not we don t still have any visibility into that demand yes in each iteration of different smartphones there is more and more laser processing done whether it be some of the welding applications around the frame or different materials being used increasing use of ultrafast pulsed lasers not just sort of focused on the metal processing side of things valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board uv and so on timothy p v mammen chief financial officer and senior vice president yes the uv so yes the applications have broadened and that market does see a bit of a rebound with new product introductions we would certainly hope to be at the vanguard of benefiting from that we just don t have any visibility into it meaningful at the moment and so i mentioned the stuff we ve seen as orders coming through valentin p gapontsev chief executive officer and chairman of the board even imaging lasers now more practical than it was in some application and was recognized worldwide to recognized for example for urology for stone removal and so on it s now practical all the best professors and doctors in the world in america europe and now in china will open also now to say we re seeing qualification for qualification in some countries and after one two years it would be practically with you practically with already in place now both in many others who before dominated the market now all replaced with our thulium lasers it s a new revolution now our sales grew already by hundred but in future will be by many thousands and this laser is much more costly than material processing lasers one thulium is like 10 chinese lasers cost so it s really a very big business we expect and we now introduced many other applications also medical lasers new generation fiber first time a fiber instead of this very old laser they used up to now and not useful not practical at all and those are now practical found what is fiber laser a real new innovation and with the medical application where it brings the most big companies right now making hundreds of millions of dollars in this market operator that is all the time we have for questions i d like to hand the call back to management for closing comments james hillier vice president of investor relations well thank you for joining us this morning for your continued interest in ipg we look forward to speaking with you over the coming weeks and our next

q1 2019 sales of 624 million gaap diluted eps of 0 11 and adjusted diluted eps 1 of 0 16 at top end of guidance range of 0 16 at top end of guidance range company announces land purchase in bangladesh for approximately 45 million as part of major south east asian capacity expansion initiative to support international growth company reaffirms sales and adjusted diluted eps guidance for 2019 1 please refer to definition and reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in this press release montreal may 01 2019 globe newswire all amounts are in u s dollars except where otherwise indicated gildan activewear inc gil tsx and nyse today announced its results for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 and updated its full year guidance the company also announced the completion of the purchase of a sizable land parcel in bangladesh as part of its new capacity expansion initiative to develop large scale vertically integrated manufacturing in south east asia to support expected sales growth results for the first quarter were in line with expectations setting the company on track to deliver on its full year sales and eps targets for 2019 gaap diluted eps for the first quarter totaled 0 11 and consistent with the company s guidance as updated on march 26 2019 adjusted diluted eps of 0 16 came in at the high end of the company s guidance range of 0 14 to 0 16 as expected earnings were down for the quarter versus last year due to anticipated factors including the impact on sales from lower levels of distributor restocking and higher raw material and other input cost pressures in addition the earnings decline reflected a 0 12 per share trade accounts receivable impairment charge primarily related to the wind down of the heritage sportswear operations which is under receivership as previously announced on march 26 2019 net sales were down 3 6 in the first quarter and were better than the company s guidance which called for a decline in the mid to high single digit range primarily due to stronger than anticipated sales of fleece products and an earlier start of initial shipments of the company s new private label men s underwear program which will be available to consumers in the second quarter during the quarter we continued to execute on supply chain initiatives aimed at driving increased operational efficiency across our manufacturing base and from which cost benefits are expected to start materializing meaningfully in the fourth quarter of 2019 and benefiting gross margins in 2020 we also continued with efforts to reduce sg a as we work towards achieving a 2020 target of lowering sg a as a percentage of sales to 12 or better finally on april 9 2019 we completed the purchase of land in bangladesh which is intended to be used to expand our global textile and sewing operations our plans consist of the development of a large multi plant manufacturing complex which is currently expected to include two large textile facilities and related sewing operations once fully operational this complex is expected to provide capacity to service over 500 million in sales over the next twenty four months the company plans to construct and develop the first textile facility at the complex initial production at the facility is expected to start in the latter part of 2021 the company believes the build out of a large scale manufacturing hub in south east asia will significantly enhance its positioning to service international markets and support other key sales growth drivers operating results during the first quarter we generated sales of 623 9 million down 3 6 compared to the prior year quarter reflecting declines of 4 1 in activewear and 1 8 in the hosiery and underwear category as expected the decline in activewear where we generated 493 6 million in sales for the quarter was primarily due to lower levels of distributor restocking of imprintables compared to the level of restocking that occurred in the first quarter last year in advance of the price increase implemented in march 2018 these factors were partly offset by double digit growth in fleece shipments which drove more favourable product mix and the impact of higher net selling prices the slight sales decline in the hosiery and underwear category where we saw 130 4 million in overall sales was mainly attributable to lower gildan branded socks and underwear sales in the mass retail channel which was largely offset by higher socks sales of licensed and global lifestyle brands compared to last year as well as the benefit of earlier than anticipated shipments of a new private label men s underwear program in the mass channel for which initial shipments began towards the end of the first quarter gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 of 25 8 was down 140 basis points over the same period last year the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year quarter which was expected was primarily due to higher raw material and other input costs including inflationary pressures and unfavourable foreign exchange partly offset by the benefit of higher net selling prices and more favourable product mix sg a expenses for the first quarter of 2019 of 93 0 million were at the same level as in the prior year quarter as a percentage of sales sg a expenses were 14 9 or 60 basis points higher than the prior year quarter primarily reflecting the lower level of sales in the quarter compared to last year during the first quarter of 2019 the company recorded an impairment of trade accounts receivable of 24 4 million of which 21 7 million related to the wind down of operations of heritage sportswear which is under receivership as announced on march 26 2019 and 2 5 million related to the bankruptcy of payless shoesource consequently operating income of 32 7 million and adjusted operating income1 of 43 3 million were down 43 6 million and 39 4 million respectively compared to the same period last year reflecting the lower sales base inflationary cost pressures on gross profit and the trade receivable impairment charge net earnings for the three months ended march 31 2019 amounted to 22 7 million or 0 11 per share on a diluted basis compared with net earnings of 67 9 million or 0 31 per share on a diluted basis for the same period last year excluding the impact of after tax restructuring and acquisition related costs in both years gildan reported adjusted net earnings1 of 32 8 million or 0 16 per share on a diluted basis down from 74 6 million or 0 34 per share on a diluted basis in the first quarter of 2018 mainly due to the decline in operating income and higher net financial expenses the earnings decline on a per share basis was partly offset by the benefit of a lower share count compared to the prior year the company consumed 127 8 million of free cash flow1 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 40 0 million of free cash flow consumed in the first quarter last year mainly as a result of lower earnings in the quarter as anticipated and higher working capital requirements including planned inventory build during the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures totaling 22 8 million related primarily to investments in textile capacity expansion including the ramp up of our new rio nance 6 facility and related sewing expansion as well as investments in information technology during the first quarter of 2019 the company repurchased 876 459 common shares at a total cost of approximately 31 0 million pursuant to its normal course issuer bid ncib programs the company ended the first quarter of 2019 with net debt1 of 891 5 million and a net debt leverage ratio1 of 1 6 times net debt to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda1 in line with the company s target leverage outlook the company is now projecting 2019 gaap diluted eps of 1 75 to 1 85 and adjusted diluted eps of 1 90 to 2 00 on projected sales growth in the mid single digit range sales and adjusted diluted eps guidance is unchanged since the company s update on march 26 2019 the gaap eps range compares to our previous guidance of 1 80 to 1 90 which reflected previously projected restructuring and acquisition related costs of approximately 20 million after refining and incorporating estimates related to further manufacturing integration including the consolidation of canadian sheer hosiery manufacturing within the company s global supply chain and additional sales and marketing initiatives to drive further operational efficiencies across the organization the company is now projecting restructuring and acquisition related costs to be in the range of 30 million with the completion of the land acquisition in bangladesh for approximately 45 million in cash the company has updated its capital expenditure projection to be approximately 175 million compared to its previous guidance of 125 million consequently free cash flow generation for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of 300 to 350 million compared to 350 to 400 million previously adjusted ebitda is now projected to be in excess of 605 million after reflecting the trade receivable charge in the quarter compared to in excess of 630 million previously declaration of quarterly dividend the board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 0 134 per share payable on june 10 2019 to shareholders of record on may 16 2019 this

or 1 8 million higher than the year ago quarter and 0 8 million higher than the sequential quarter depreciation expense increased by 0 2 million and amortization expense increased by 1 6 million from the year ago quarter the increase in amortization expense is primarily related to the amortization of a commercial related intangible asset associated with the may 2018 acquisition of four high spec osvs from aries marine corporation amortization expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2019 and in fiscal 2020 as a result of currently active vessels that were placed in service under the company s fifth osv newbuild program commencing their initial intermediate drydock or special surveys the company expects amortization expense to increase further whenever market conditions warrant reactivation of currently stacked vessels which will then require the company to drydock such vessels and thereafter to revert to historical average levels interest expense interest expense was 19 7 million during the first quarter of 2019 which was 5 8 million higher than the same period in 2018 the year over year increase was primarily due to a higher blended average cash coupon and an increase

term loans was reduced by 0 4 million of original issue discount that was associated with the 2019 notes these net credits will be amortized prospectively as yield adjustments to interest expense over

ended march 31 2019 three months ended march 31 2018 and the three months ended december 31 2018 the company excluded the dilutive effect of equity awards representing the rights to acquire 404 750 and 529 shares of common stock respectively because the effect was anti dilutive as of march 31 2019 december 31 2018 and march 31 2018 the 1 500 convertible senior notes were not dilutive as the average price of the company s stock was less than the effective conversion price of 68 53 for such notes 3 the company owned 66 new generation osvs as of march 31 2019 including the four osvs acquired from aries marine in may 2018 excluded from this data are eight mpsvs owned by the company and four non owned vessels operated by the company for the u s navy 4 in response to weak market conditions the company elected to stack certain of its new generation osvs on various dates since october 1 2014 active new generation osvs represent vessels that are immediately available for service during each respective period 5 average utilization rates are based on a 365 day year for all active and stacked vessels vessels are considered utilized when they are generating revenues 6 effective utilization rate is based on a denominator comprised only of vessel days available for service by the active fleet which excludes the impact of stacked vessel days 7 average new generation osv dayrates represent average revenue per day which includes charter hire crewing services and net brokerage revenues based on the number of days during the period that the osvs generated revenues 8 effective dayrate represents the average dayrate multiplied by the average new generation utilization rate for the respective period 9 represents revenues from shore based operations vessel management services related to non owned vessels including from the o m contract with the u s navy and ancillary equipment rentals including from rovs 10 non gaap financial measure the company discloses and discusses ebitda as a non gaap financial measure in its public releases including quarterly earnings releases investor conference calls and other filings with the securities and exchange commission the company defines ebitda as earnings net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization the company s measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies other companies may calculate ebitda differently than the company which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure the company views ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and as such believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income net income or loss cash flows provided by operating investing and financing activities or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap ebitda is widely used by investors and other users of the company s financial statements as a supplemental financial measure that when viewed with gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations the company believes ebitda provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting its ability to service debt pay deferred taxes and fund drydocking charges and other maintenance capital expenditures the company also believes the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare its cash flow generating capacity from quarter to quarter and year to year ebitda is also a financial metric used by management i as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations ii as a significant criteria for annual incentive cash bonuses paid to the company s executive officers and other shore based employees iii to compare to the ebitda of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions and iv to assess the company s ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness in addition the company has also historically made certain adjustments as applicable to ebitda for gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt stock based compensation expense and interest income or adjusted ebitda to internally evaluate its performance based on the computation of ratios used in certain financial covenants of its credit agreements with various lenders the company believes that such ratios can at times be material components of financial covenants and when applicable failure to comply with such covenants could result in the acceleration of indebtedness or the imposition of restrictions on the company s financial flexibility set forth below are the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating activities ebitda does not reflect the future capital expenditure requirements that may be necessary to replace the company s existing vessels as a result of normal wear and tear ebitda does not reflect the interest future principal payments and other financing related charges necessary to service the debt that the company has incurred in acquiring and constructing its vessels ebitda does not reflect the deferred income taxes that the company will eventually have to pay once it is no longer in an overall tax net operating loss position as applicable and ebitda does not reflect changes in the company s net working capital position management compensates for the above described limitations in using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure by only using ebitda to supplement the company s gaap results 11 commercial related downtime results from commercial related vessel improvements such as the addition of cranes rovs helidecks living quarters and other specialized vessel equipment the modification of vessel capacities or capabilities such as dp upgrades and mid body extensions which costs are typically included in and offset in whole or in part by higher dayrates charged to customers and the speculative relocation of vessels from one geographic market to another 12 the capital expenditure amounts included in this table are anticipated cash outlays before the allocation of construction period interest as applicable 13 as of may 1 2019 the company s inactive fleet of 36 new generation osvs that were stacked was comprised of the following eleven 200 class osvs twenty two 240 class osvs and three 265 class osvs 14 the low and high ends of the guidance ranges set forth in this table are not intended to cover unexpected variations from currently anticipated market conditions these ranges provide only a reasonable deviation from the conditions that are expected to occur 15 the company s forward guidance for general and administrative expense includes an estimate of stock based compensation expense for outstanding share settled and cash settled awards such expense for outstanding cash settled awards is re measured quarterly based on either a 10 day trailing average stock price prior to each quarter end or a black scholes value at quarter end as of march 31 2019 the 10 day trailing average stock price was 1 41 per share and the black scholes value was 0 97 future increases or decreases in such average stock price can be highly volatile and will commensurately impact stock based compensation expense and thus g a expense as cash settled awards are required to be marked to market with cumulative catch up adjustments at each quarter end 16 interest on the company s first lien term loans is variable based on changes in libor or the london interbank offered rate the guidance included in this press release related to such facility is based on industry estimates of libor in future periods as of may 1 2019 actual results may differ from this estimate interest expense on the company s second lien term loans 2019 convertible senior notes 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes are at fixed rates of 9 5 1 5 5 875 and 5 0 respectively 17 represents incremental imputed non cash oid interest expense required by accounting standards pertaining to the company s 1 500 convertible senior notes due 2019 18 represents the non cash recognition of the 21 4 million gain on the debt for debt exchange associated with the company s first lien term loans and the 21 3 million gain on the debt for debt exchange associated with the company s second lien term loans such amounts are being deferred and amortized prospectively as yield adjustments to interest expense as required by gaap under debt modification accounting 19 projected weighted average diluted shares do not reflect any potential dilution resulting from the company s 1 500 convertible senior notes warrants related to the company s 1 500 convertible senior notes become dilutive when the average price of the company s stock exceeds the effective conversion price for such notes of 68 53 contacts todd

reaffirming the full year ranges we provided on february 6 2019 for cloud revenue total revenue and adjusted ebitda as follows cloud revenue is expected to be in the range of 655 0 million to 660 0 million total revenue is expected to be in the range of 810 0 million to 815 0 million adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of 182 0 million to 187 0 million for each 0 01 change in the u s dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate we estimate it would affect our full year 2019 guidance ranges for cloud revenue by approximately 1 6 million total revenue by approximately 2 0 million and adjusted ebitda by approximately 0 6 million second quarter 2019 we are issuing guidance for the second quarter of 2019 as follows cloud revenue is expected to be in the range of 154 0 million to 156 0 million total revenue is expected to be in the range of 191 0 million to 193 0 million adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of 37 0 million to 39 0 million for each 0 01 change in the

5 million and adjusted ebitda by approximately 0 15 million furthermore consistent with prior years the first quarter revenue for our business is seasonally higher than the second quarter revenue primarily due to seasonally higher float balances and year end printing and processing revenue for w 2 united states and t4 canada forms in the first quarter of each year we have not reconciled the adjusted ebitda ranges for the second quarter of 2019 or the full fiscal year of 2019 to the directly comparable gaap financial measure because applicable information for future periods on which this reconciliation would be based is not readily available due to uncertainty regarding and the potential variability of depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other items conference call details ceridian will host a conference call on may 1 2019 at 5 00 p m eastern time to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of

ceridian is a global human capital management software company dayforce our flagship cloud hcm platform provides human resources payroll benefits workforce management and talent management functionality our platform is used to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle including attracting engaging paying deploying and developing people ceridian has solutions for organizations of all sizes use of non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures in this release including adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin and revenue growth in a constant currency we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda is a component of our management incentive plan and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees non cash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary share based compensation expense severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and environmental reserve charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit loss net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined under gaap are not measures of net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap and are subject to important limitations our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the impact of share based compensation upon our results of operations adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation we present revenue growth in a constant currency to assess how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations which we believe is useful to management and investors we calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed rate of 1 30 canadian dollar to 1 00 u s dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in canadian dollars for all applicable historical periods forward looking statements this press release contains forward

financial measure see below for more information and a reconciliation of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap net sales for the quarter ended march 31 2019 increased to 475 million compared to 452 million in the first quarter of 2018 the improvement was primarily due to higher sales volumes of graftech manufactured graphite electrodes these sales volumes increased to 45 thousand metric tons mt from 42 thousand metric tons in the prior year period the weighted average realized price of these graphite electrodes was 9 954 per metric ton in line with the prior year period net income for the first quarter of 2019 decreased to

2019 compared to 310 million in the first quarter of 2018 higher graphite electrode sales volumes were offset by higher cost of sales due to higher prices for third party needle coke cash flow from operating activities increased to 157 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 141 million in the comparable period of 2018 first quarter 2018 cash flow from operating activities was impacted

see below for more information and a reconciliation of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap net sales for the quarter ended march 31 2019 increased to 475 million compared to 452 million in the first quarter of 2018 the improvement was primarily due to higher sales volumes of graftech manufactured graphite electrodes these sales volumes increased to 45 thousand metric tons mt from 42 thousand metric tons in the prior year period the weighted average realized price of these graphite electrodes was 9 954 per metric ton in line with the prior year period net income for the first quarter of 2019 decreased to 197 million or 0 68 per share compared to 224 million or 0 74 per share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations also decreased to 284 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 310 million in the first quarter of 2018 higher graphite electrode sales volumes were offset by higher cost of sales due to higher prices for third party needle coke cash flow from operating activities increased to 157 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 141 million in the comparable period of 2018 first quarter 2018 cash flow from operating activities was impacted primarily by a significant one time change in accounts receivable due to higher pricing for graphite electrodes first quarter cash flow typically includes the majority of our annual cash tax payments cash tax payments totaled

may 1 2019 on april 24 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation â with paraguay growth in 2018 was 3 7 percent which is near potential and in line with the recent past despite negative spillovers from the region growth was driven by strong private investment and household consumption exports were affected by the economic crisis in argentina and the strong depreciation of paraguayâ s neighborsâ currencies the current account deteriorated but remained in surplus average inflation in 2018 was 3 6 percentâ near the mid point of the central bankâ s target range inflation fell during the year from 4 7 percent in january to 3 2 in december the result of declining food prices and the appreciation of the guaranã vis ã vis neighboring countries monetary policy rates were on hold in 2018 however monetary conditions tightened as the real exchange rate appreciated and real interest rates rose in february and march of 2019 the bcp cut the policy rate twice from 5â¼ to 4â¾ percent citing uncertainty about the external environment and incipient weakening of domestic demand the fiscal deficit in 2018 amounted to 1 3 percent of gdp slightly higher than in 2017 but below the ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law growth in 2019 is projected at 3 5 percent risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside external risks include weaker than expected growth in argentina and brazil and adverse price movements in the agricultural commodity markets domestic risks include weather related shocks and delays in the execution of public investment over the medium term the key challenge is to sustain the rapid growth of real incomes during the past 15 years over the past decade paraguay has been one of the fastest growing economies in south america averaging above 4 5 percent real growth per year but the factors that have propelled this growthâ including a boom in agricultural commodity pricesâ are likely to provide less support going forward the consultation focused on the policies needed to promote long term growth widen the tax base improve public spending efficiency and strengthen financial sector supervision executive board assessment directors commended the paraguayan authorities for their prudent macroeconomic policies which have contributed to rapid growth and sharp reduction in poverty directors considered that policy priorities ahead should focus on consolidating macroeconomic gains reducing dependence on the agriculture sector by diversifying the economy and enhancing productivity to attain sustainable and strong growth as well as further reduce poverty directors commended the authoritiesâ prudent fiscal policies which have reduced the public debt however they noted that with the deficit close to the ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law it is important to take action to create further fiscal space for priority reforms and investment directors recommended increasing revenues particularly by reducing exemptions and deductions and improving tax compliance they also encouraged the authorities to reprioritize expenditure within the existing envelope away from current spending and toward investment in infrastructure capital and social spending including in health and education directors considered that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and consistent with inflation objectives they noted that exchange rate flexibility should continue to be a key shock absorber and that interventions should be limited to mitigate disorderly market conditions directors welcomed that the banking system is wellâ capitalized and profitable they encouraged continued strengthening of supervision of financial cooperatives and adopting supervision standards for the casas de credito and casas comerciales directors commended the progress made towards implementing the 2017 financial sector stability review recommendations and encouraged steps to further strengthen the institutional framework for interagency coordination they underscored that further strengthening the aml cft framework would support financial stability directors encouraged the authorities to reform the pension system to ensure its longâ term sustainability seizing the opportunity that demographic trends are still favorable they noted that resuming the effort to establish a pension fund supervisor would be an important step in this regard directors noted that economic diversification and productivity growth are needed to maintain rapid growth they considered that priority should be given to tackling corruption and strengthening the rule of law enhancing the business climate as well as improving transport infrastructure and quality of education paraguay

analysis the un economic commission for africa eca in its annual economic report on africa focused on financing development in africa highlighted the urgency to curb what it termed revenue leaks through tax evasion and tax avoidance as well as through misguided government policies multinational corporations corrupt officials and financial intermediaries around the world siphon off african wealth leaving national budgets starved for resources to invest in health education and sustainable economic growth this report released on march 23 and available on the eca website direct link lays out specific ways in which african countries can curb these revenue leaks but it also stresses that these are limited by the fact that so much of the diverted wealth is hidden in financial capitals outside africa

financial measure see below for more information and a reconciliation of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap net sales for the quarter ended march 31 2019 increased to 475 million compared to 452 million in the first quarter of 2018 the improvement was primarily due to higher sales volumes of graftech manufactured graphite electrodes these sales volumes increased to 45 thousand metric tons mt from 42 thousand metric tons in the prior year period the weighted average realized price of these graphite electrodes was 9 954 per metric ton in line with the prior year period net income for the first quarter of 2019 decreased to

2019 compared to 310 million in the first quarter of 2018 higher graphite electrode sales volumes were offset by higher cost of sales due to higher prices for third party needle coke cash flow from operating activities increased to 157 million in the first quarter of 2019 from 141 million in the comparable period of 2018 first quarter 2018 cash flow from operating activities was impacted primarily by a significant one time change in accounts receivable due to higher pricing for graphite electrodes first quarter cash flow typically includes the majority of our annual cash tax payments

required by law whether as a result of new information future developments or otherwise non gaap financial measures in addition to providing results that are determined in accordance with gaap we have provided certain financial measures that are not in accordance with gaap ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures we define ebitda from continuing operations a non gaap financial measure as net income or loss plus interest expense minus interest income plus income taxes discontinued operations and depreciation and amortization from continuing operations we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as ebitda from continuing operations plus any pension and other post employment benefit opeb plan expenses rationalization related charges initial and follow on public offering expenses non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar related party tax receivable agreement expense stock based compensation and non cash fixed asset write offs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is the primary metric used by our management and our board of directors to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance we monitor adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplement to our gaap measures and believe it is useful to present to investors because we believe that it facilitates evaluation of our period to period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature allowing comparison of our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods unaffected by differences in capital structure capital investment cycles and fixed asset base in addition we believe adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and similar measures are widely used by investors securities analysts ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating companies in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities we also monitor and present to investors the ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is a useful and widely used way to assess our leverage our use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments including any capital expenditure requirements to augment or replace our capital assets adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect expenses relating to our pension and opeb plans adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect the non cash gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement of non operating liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the u s dollar adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect initial and follow on public offering expenses adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect related party tax receivable agreement expense adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect rationalization related charges stock based compensation or the non cash write off of fixed assets and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the reconciliation presented below our presentations of ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be construed as suggesting that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or non recurring items when evaluating our performance you should consider ebitda from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations alongside other financial

imf executive board concludes article iv consultation with paraguay on april 24 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation with paraguay growth in 2018 was 3 7 percent which is near potential and in line with the recent past despite negative spillovers from the region growth was driven by strong private investment and household consumption exports were affected by the economic crisis in argentina and the strong depreciation of paraguay s neighbors currencies the current account deteriorated but remained in surplus average inflation in 2018 was 3 6 percent near the mid point of the central bank s target range inflation fell during the year from 4 7 percent in january to 3 2 in december the result of declining food prices and the appreciation of the guaraní vis à vis neighboring countries monetary policy rates were on hold in 2018 however monetary conditions tightened as the real exchange rate appreciated and real interest rates rose in february and march of 2019 the bcp cut the policy rate twice from 5¼ to 4¾ percent citing uncertainty about the external environment and incipient weakening of domestic demand the fiscal deficit in 2018 amounted to 1 3 percent of gdp slightly higher than in 2017 but below the ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law growth in 2019 is projected at 3 5 percent risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside external risks include weaker than expected growth in argentina and brazil and adverse price movements in the agricultural commodity markets domestic risks include weather related shocks and delays in the execution of public investment over the medium term the key challenge is to sustain the rapid growth of real incomes during the past 15 years over the past decade paraguay has been one of the fastest growing economies in south america averaging above 4 5 percent real growth per year but the factors that have propelled this growth including a boom in agricultural commodity prices are likely to provide less support going forward the consultation focused on the policies needed to promote long term growth widen the tax base improve public spending efficiency and strengthen financial sector supervision executive board assessment directors commended the paraguayan authorities for their prudent macroeconomic policies which have contributed to rapid growth and sharp reduction in poverty directors considered that policy priorities ahead should focus on consolidating macroeconomic gains reducing dependence on the agriculture sector by diversifying the economy and enhancing productivity to attain sustainable and strong growth as well as further reduce poverty directors commended the authorities prudent fiscal policies which have reduced the public debt however they noted that with the deficit close to the ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law it is important to take action to create further fiscal space for priority reforms and investment directors recommended increasing revenues particularly by reducing exemptions and deductions and improving tax compliance they also encouraged the authorities to reprioritize expenditure within the existing envelope away from current spending and toward investment in infrastructure capital and social spending including in health and education directors considered that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and consistent with inflation objectives they noted that exchange rate flexibility should continue to be a key shock absorber and that interventions should be limited to mitigate disorderly market conditions directors welcomed that the banking system is well capitalized and profitable they encouraged continued strengthening of supervision of financial cooperatives and adopting supervision standards for the casas de credito and casas comerciales directors commended the progress made towards implementing the 2017 financial sector stability review recommendations and encouraged steps to further strengthen the institutional framework for interagency coordination they underscored that further strengthening the aml cft framework would support financial stability directors encouraged the authorities to reform the pension system to ensure its long term sustainability seizing the opportunity that demographic trends are still favorable they noted that resuming the effort to establish a pension fund supervisor would be an important step in this regard directors noted that economic diversification and productivity growth are needed to maintain rapid growth they considered that priority should be given to tackling corruption and strengthening the rule of law enhancing the business climate as well as improving

the authors would like to thank ujju aggarwal max ajl samar al bulushi moutaa amine el waer brahim rouabah and hèla yousfi for their help on the article as well as noah lapidus for his research on people s tribunals in brazil and the philippines building on decades of struggle the january 2011 tunisian uprising triggered a wave of popular revolt that spread across north africa and west asia if the tunisian transition was exceptional in its relative peacefulness and pacted nature it was less so in regard to its susceptibility to external influence 1 though more tangible in the cases of other regional states marked by externally driven or supported instability violence and destruction tunisia s so called transition was also conditioned by western intervention and complex geopolitical entanglements western dominated institutions and states seized upon the haziness produced by the uprising to more fully penetrate tunisia s political economy and further neocolonial capitalist development despite fierce and persistent resistance tunisia became the focus of a celebrated project of transitional justice which is now the globally mandated method of reconciling victims and perpetrators following a nonrevolutionary regime change tunisia was the first country to establish an entire ministry charged with overseeing the establishment of the transitional justice processes which was dismantled shortly after the passing of the 2013 organic law on establishing and organizing transitional justice though there were several ad hoc transitional justice mechanisms prior to its passage the law provided the legal framework and mandate for the official establishment of the truth and dignity commission tdc instance vérité et dignité in june 2014 the tdc completed its mission and released its final report on march 26 2019 the south african truth and reconciliation commission and the post cold war wave of transitions are the most emblematic cases of applying transitional justice the precedent established in these cases is a form of transitional justice that limits itself to a narrow definition of past state crimes and paves the way for neoliberal governance and it was probably hoped that tunisia would stick to that model in fact the actual process of transitional justice in tunisia revealed numerous tensions and conflicts the local political and economic elite linked to the deposed government attempted to block the process while the former international backers of zine el abidine ben ali the president of tunisia from 1987 until his ousting in 2011 sought to defuse its radicalism ushering transitional justice into an institutionalized framework with a focus on legal procedures and individual crimes while intentionally ignoring the larger political context including structural and longstanding causes of injustice there were also those who conceive of themselves as part of a more broadly defined category of victims including not only those subjected to the physical violence and political repression of the state but also to material and social exclusions exploitation and everyday forms of alienation that are a feature of colonial capitalist forms of development they have sought to harness the process to promote the tunisian revolt s more ambitious goals beyond mere truth telling and individual reparations they have pursued a more substantive justice nevertheless due to the imbrications of the institutionalized transitional justice process within imperial and neoliberal capitalist structures of power their achievements have been limited the most notable success of tunisia s popular forces was the challenging in mainstream spaces of hegemonic narratives about the country s past and its postcolonial identity but the uneven nature of this struggle points to a need for different models of justice in what follows we will critically examine tunisia s process of transitional justice with a view to showing how the very paradigm employed that is the rule of law that transitional justice consistently seeks to impose is skewed in favor of imperial interests arguing that this complicity with the status quo can be traced to the paradigm s origins in the mid twentieth century victory of european powers over nazi germany and its allies there are other models of justice however that are not rooted in this eurocentric victor s history but instead derive from revolutionary traditions a key one is the people s tribunal used since the late 1960s in the revolutionary spirit of the 2010 11 revolt and building on its more radical tradition we sketch out the very broad outlines of what a people s tribunal in tunisia would look like its aims would be to amplify and extend the popular justice claims that surfaced during the country s recent transitional justice process establishing such a tribunal might help build a symbolic reservoir and organizational force that could ultimately contribute to substantial revolutionary change in the country tunisia s transitional justice process a critical anatomy from the start tunisia s truth and dignity commission was a magnet for public interest quickly generating a great deal of grassroots support the commission s legitimacy was further boosted with the appointment of longstanding political activist sihem ben sedrine at its helm over the years more than sixty two thousand claims were submitted and forty nine thousand secret hearings and fourteen public ones were held concerning a broad range of issues from the repression of protestors during the 2010 11 tunisian revolt to the victims of violence during the anticolonial struggle of the 1950s as of now 174 cases have been transferred to special chambers and 30 trials have already commenced most recently a specialized tribunal in the southwestern city of gafsa looked at the repression of an uprising in 2008 against rising levels of unemployment regional marginalization and the neoliberal restructuring of the mining basin s largest employer this narrative of a smooth and linear progress belies the actual struggle that has underpinned the process from the beginning with fierce opposition presented by a political economic elite aligned to the deposed government this opposition was emboldened by the failure of the national constituent assembly elected in 2011 to pass lustration measures meaning that former ben ali government members could participate in future elections in the fall of 2015 newly elected president beji caid essebsi himself a former bourguiba minister went so far as calling for the country to turn the page on the past and move forward in the name of economic development though his proposed expansive amnesty was ultimately rejected in september 2017 the government passed a more modest version of the bill that provided amnesty for civil servants implicated in economic crimes there were also continual attempts to delegitimize ben sendrine and to sabotage the process especially from tunisian media whose ownership and editorial structure have remained largely unchanged since the days of ben ali s rule 2 another hindrance was the refusal of the ministries of interior and defense to respond to summons appear in court or cooperate with demands for information including access to state archives this could not help but fuel popular disillusionment as did the fact that while some 260 cases of human rights violations were transferred to specialized courts many others were not finally there is a general dissatisfaction with the commission s failure to address regional marginalization and economic crimes which were part of its mandate even if these procedural and political obstacles had all been resolved however it is unlikely that tunisia s transitional justice could have produced anything other than limited results understanding the reasons for this requires us to look at the incomplete character of tunisia s 2010 11 revolution which failed to upend the racialized norms of international power relations that maintain the country in a subordinate condition the revolution stopped far short of unravelling the material fabric in which these neocolonial relations of power are embedded hemmed in by imperially accrued debt and a structurally dependent economy designed to generate surplus for big capitalists 3 nor did it successfully carry forward the longstanding efforts of tunisia s numerous postcolonial movements and rebellions such as the 1968 student movement or the 1984 bread uprising against the termination of wheat and semolina subsidies imposed by the international monetary fund imf to name just two with the recent revolution having stopped halfway a peace and reconciliation process could follow one of two paths it could either 1 ratify the existing global and neocolonial order or it could 2 point beyond that order highlighting the need for further profound changes transitional justice which was the option chosen unequivocally follows the first of these paths in tunisia as in south africa and the former soviet union transitional justice was the handmaiden to a neoliberal transition it could do this because it systematically depoliticizes atomizes and appropriates social struggle while deflecting attention from the structural causes of violence and inequality modern transitional justice is closely tied to the neoliberal project of governance as opposed to the brute force of military intervention neoliberal governance is a more subtle power strategy for maintaining and extending imperialist and capitalist agendas it is supposedly based on principles of self regulation with some of its key mechanisms including so called voluntary partnerships and legal standardization across borders that facilitate the free flow of capital if the strategy indeed establishes a continuity of diffused powers this is always based on the normalization of market values in effect such liberal governance practices and transitional justice too insofar as it works to maintain the capitalist rule of law across borders propose to embed societies in the economy thereby turning on its head the world historical norm that karl polanyi observed of the economy being conditioned by social institutions 4 evidence of the class and imperialist interests that promoted transitional justice in tunisia can be found in the list of its most enthusiastic backers these include the very same western governments that had previously propped up dictatorial rule in the country and now lavished support on the tdc 5 the united nations un was another key sponsor of the process although certain un organs have historically been amenable to third world agendas many of its projects have abetted neoliberal development under the guise of democratic governance and conflict resolution in tunisia s transitional justice process it was the united nations development program undp that worked closely with the international center for transitional justice to mentor the tdc this included training one hundred civil society focal persons in the techniques of transitional justice principles to form a group that would facilitate a nation wide dialogue on the drafting of the 2013 transitional justice law 6 many of the undp s expressed aims were certainly laudable including protection of human rights ensuring that women and marginalized groups play an effective role in the pursuit of a just society and participation of all citizens in the development process however the agency demonstrated a clear tendency to mold postrevolutionary conceptions of justice in tunisia according to neoliberal frameworks out of step with local realities 7 the prominent role of the united nations was on display in the commission s december 14 closing ceremony where its representative spoke of rule of law democracy and societal reconciliation but did not even mention the 2010 11 revolt that initiated the process there was a previous consultation procedure set up in tunisia yet attempts to modify the preestablished transitional justice paradigm were generally silenced or contained for example when queried respondents would sometimes point to the structural roots of tunisia s deep seated political class and spatial inequalities and proposed correspondingly radical solutions these solutions included rejecting the parceling of injustice into individual crimes and investing the concept of criminality with more radical content likewise in the reparation and reform phases some participants predicated reestablishing peace between state and society on the transformation of tunisia s political economy finally delving into distributive politics some proposed that productive regions receive a fixed percentage of any profits made on state or private investments in extractive industries in their region 8 although a limited number of these more radical demands were eventually adopted the tdc sidelined most proposals to modify significantly the justice process suggesting that the exercise of consulting had been little more than window dressing in sum tunisia generally adhered to the hegemonic model of transitional justice the 2010 11 revolution had failed to transform tunisia s neocolonial condition the country s unequal incorporation into the global political economy and the model of justice applied did not choose to look beyond existing structures of global inequality but rather reinforce them plus ça change transitioning without transforming transitional justice is often described as a legal social process that governs the change within a state from repressive violent and illiberal rule to democracy peace and societal reconciliation 9 thus defined the practice seems wholly benevolent and unquestionably progressive yet one only has to scratch the surface of actually existing practices of transitional justice to reveal the powerful forces that operate behind them define their goals and govern their outcomes as a political project transitional justice works institutionally to lock postcolonial states within an unequal capitalist global economy so that they can continue to be sites of speculative investment and natural resource and surplus value extraction 10 to accomplish this it benefits from several key framing devices that make the practice especially fitted for neoliberal governance first transitional justice is chronically short sighted in as much as it presents the causes of violence dispossession exclusion and marginalization as domestic or national concerns thereby masking the foundational roles of colonialism global capitalism and imperialism in shaping relations of power over the longue durée 11 second transitional justice consistently adheres to the liberal practice of privileging individual and negative rights over collective and positive rights this reflects u s hegemony over the human rights framework insofar as the right to be protected from state intervention takes precedence over the right to certain social goods and standards of living 12 thirdly transitional justice systematically ignores the generalized injustice of today s economic order the capitalist world system 13 not surprisingly then it can be almost impossible for social movements aimed at radical transformation to harness the institution of transitional justice whose framework works to reinforce the global status quo the treatment of the 2008 gafsa revolt is in many ways emblematic of the tdc s shortcomings and limitations the roots of the revolt long predate the events under consideration all of the cities southwest of the mining basin have inarguably been victims of over a century s worth of natural resource extraction land and water dispossession pollution and labor exploitation going back to the establishment of the first phosphate mine established in 1897 during the colonial era the postindependence state chose to pursue the same export led model and following the structural adjustment diktats of the imf restructured the mine and dismantled social services further eroding the well being of workers and their families the 2008 popular intifada was the inevitable reaction to these changes and other forms of oppression and dispossession that had accrued for over a century the state response was brutal a six month siege multiple arrests the torture of protestors and even several murders the region was collectively punished through policing stigma and deeper economic marginalization yet in addressing the brutal repression in gafsa the tribunal considered only a limited number of post june 2008 individual criminal cases this kind of quid pro quo typical of transitional justice fundamentally transformed the nature of the gafsa case it failed to acknowledge colonialism s foundational and structuring role in the multiple forms of violence to which the population of gafsa has been subjected over decades not only that but it also depoliticized state violence focusing on specific crimes of select groups of individuals rather than the broader role of the state in facilitating systemic oppression for more than one hundred years despite the importance of the testimonies presented this collective regional experience was transposed into individual suffering in a context of global structural inequality and pressure from international financial institutions this sidelined the role of neoliberal development in perpetuating the dispossession and inequality that triggered protest tracing the genealogy of modern transitional justice can help demonstrate the forces that have shaped it and condition its current day application the modern practice of transitional justice descends from the nuremberg trials at the end of the second world war in that historic episode fascist and genocidal practices were put on trial but with a marked eurocentric bias the violence that nazi fascism exercised against jews gays communists and other subaltern groups was essentially an extension of the horrors experienced for many centuries by the victims of the trans atlantic slave trade and european colonialism what made nazi practices unacceptable to the west was their occurrence on european soil against fellow europeans the latter were unable to forgive adolf hitler not because of the crime itself but rather as aimé césaire has argued because of the crime against the white man the humiliation of the white man and the fact that he applied to europe colonialist procedures which until then had been reserved exclusively for the arabs of algeria the coolies of india and the blacks of africa 14 the nuremberg trials tendency to build a firewall between the crimes of nazi fascism and those of the colonializing powers points to a foundational contradiction that continues to haunt international law practice right up to the present transitional justice s blindness to the systematic and racialized violence the north inflicts on the south makes it highly functional to maintaining today s imperial world order which depends on that structural violence as walter rodney argues underdevelopment can only be understood in a relational context as the result of a particular relationship of exploitation namely the exploitation of one country by another a product of capitalist imperialist and colonialist exploitation in a way that depriv the societies of the benefit of their natural resources and labor 15 yet transitional justice considers its founding moment to be a set of 1946 trials that because of their eurocentrism depoliticized and narrowed possibilities of facing up to the root causes of the holocaust 16 moreover today transitional justice goes on overlooking the degree to which the global north s mantle of liberal governance depends on a racialized hierarchy of life that normalizes surplus value extraction and the pillage of the south s resources the precedent established for transitional justice from nuremberg forward is devastating the real causes of underdevelopment whether due to accumulation by dispossession or more classic forms of exploitation are simply a marginal concern for humanity dissonances within continuity when transitional justice arrived in tunisia in 2014 having passed from nuremberg through the celebrated south african and eastern european cases it nevertheless produced some dissonant results that is even if the transitional justice process generally adhered to the time honored practice of ignoring the structural and historical roots of oppression it could not entirely control and contain the debate when it came to the crimes of the colonial era in a limited way these entered the tdc s purview though the restricted timeframe for considering such crimes 1955 56 was highly arbitrary in view of the actual scope of french domination that even preceded the formation of the protectorate in 1880 to its credit the commission did cover part of tunisia s fierce intranationalist struggle recognizing the collaboration of the bourguibist wing with french colonial power in the so called liquidation of the more radical youssefite pan arab resistance resulting in the victory of a pro western gradualist independence trajectory it also examined some of the neocolonial violence perpetrated in the aftermath of tunisian independence and facilitated by tunisian authorities such as the french bombing of tunisian rebels in the battle of mount agri in tataouine although the tdc considered the colonial roots of tunisia s repressive security state with its hallmark features of extensive surveillance violent practices and mass incarceration it did not examine its embeddedness in imperial security architectures and agendas during the postcolonial period in particular the provision of finance training equipment and intelligence to tunisia s security apparatuses including the police and military through the united states france european union and united states africa command and north atlantic treaty organization programs that tunisian security apparatuses today continue to reproduce colonial policing logics and methods is not only a legacy of colonialism but also a reflection of tunisia s ongoing submission and subscription to the repressive requirements of a political economic system predicated on resource and surplus value extraction and mobility obstruction tellingly imperial forces are hardly mentioned in the report furthermore whereas the 2010 11 revolutionaries took an abolitionist approach to the neocolonial apparatuses of state security burning police stations and prisons the tdc final report calls for increased oversight transparency and other reforms of these apparatuses to bring them in line with the rule of law and a liberal rights framework inconsistent with the reigning transitional justice paradigm the tdc also considers historically marginalized regions as victims tying together regional inequality and tunisia s neoliberal western inspired development logic though the report highlights the role of the world bank and imf structural adjustment recipe in furthering disparities and consolidating the extractive model it fails to elaborate the underlying mechanisms through which this model of development has persisted despite popular resistance especially post 2011 and omits the importance of delinking from these policies and actors as a condition for nonrepetition 17 while transitional justice in tunisia managed to avoid substantial innovations in most areas one of the process s indisputable successes was its challenge to the country s official historiography for instance tunisia s first president the lawyer and nationalist leader habib bourguiba is enshrined as a national hero nevertheless the transitional justice process sparked discussions about tunisian independence and decolonization struggle that questioned bourguiba s role while recovering other purposefully eclipsed figures and narratives about the anticolonial movement including that of the more radical pan arabist movement led by salah ben youssef a movement that bourguiba collaborated with the french to suppress the tdc s discussions also drew attention to the colonial roots of tunisia s political economy heavily based on resource extraction by looking at the virtually royalty free contract french salt manufacturer cotusal has long enjoyed 18 the results remained in a symbolic register in both instances still successes on this symbolic level are no small feat for discursive control was always central to implementing both bourguiba and later ben ali s unpopular economic policies and geopolitical alignments in fact their legitimacy depended on a systematic erasure of struggles in the global south and more radical alternatives even today remnants of the old regime continue seeking legitimacy in a reified conception of the country s history the tdc s positive role in destabilizing and reshaping tunisia s conception of its postcolonial identity has not gone unnoticed its president sihem ben sedrine spoke of the history preservation role of the commission claiming that it will help prevent repression in the future 19 in the words of tunisian author sghaier salhi the tdc has contributed to transforming the state s official memory a pillar of domination by restoring some truths about power and resistance in tunisia s colonial and postcolonial history 20 as laudable as such contributions are everything points to how the commission s success in these areas were despite rather than because of its subordination to the globally mandated model of transitional justice overall the process of transitional justice in tunisia in which there emerged important but still inchoate ruptures with the overarching nuremberg model points to the need to consider alternative methodologies and formats exploited majorities and subaltern groups whose voices sometimes erupted during the debates have powerful demands for justice insofar as their claims turn on collective and economic rights and address the structural violence of the imperialist world order they clash irreconcilably with the dominant model of transitional justice that has been passed down to us to develop another paradigm we are called upon to read history against the grain how to do so instead of the hegemonic narrative based on the struggle among european powers that culminates in the justice meted out at nuremberg we could look at history from the perspective of the global south and consider the decolonial struggles of the 1950s and 60s as a potential blueprint for contemporary popular justice these movements pursued something that was the very opposite of a neoliberal transition in as much as they sought to redistribute land and resources and invoked such concepts as transnational solidarity and revolutionary justice 21 hence the memory of these decolonial struggles their conferences proclamations and movements would be a richer starting point for the radical reimagination of justice in fact reactivating it could itself constitute a step toward real revolutionary practice in our time decolonizing by other means both the bandung conference of 1955 and the tricontinental conference of 1966 are testimonies to the period not too long ago in which oppressed peoples took history into their own hands the words of the second declaration of havana which fell roughly between the two events captures the spirit of self emancipation that emerged during those decades the epic struggle that we are facing will be written by the hungry masses of indians the landless peasants the exploited workers this great mass of humanity has said enough s enough that period may seem to be a closed chapter in world history but some of its spirit survives in under recognized projects for example though largely ignored by the media the recent practice of convening people s tribunals captures the ethos of self determination that existed in bandung the tricontinental and also in the non aligned movement since these tribunals bring together activists from around the world and are designed by and accountable to the social movements and communities in which they are rooted rejecting the institutions of capitalism empire and other forms of repressive rule people s tribunals make decisions that may not be binding and do not have the force of law but their achievements in a discursive register can inspire present and future organizing people s tribunals allow the oppressed to judge the powerful defining the content as well as the scope of the procedures which reverses the norm of the powerful creating and implementing the law the first formal instance of a tribunal of this kind was the russell tribunal set up in 1966 by british philosopher and antiwar activist bertrand russell to judge u s military intervention and war crimes in vietnam the same format reemerged in later russell tribunals dealing with the u s backed brazilian and argentinian military dictatorships 1964 and 1976 respectively the u s backed coup in chile 1973 and the u s european interventions against iraq 1990 2003 there are however important examples of legal efforts to put the powerful on trial that go back even earlier for instance in 1951 an innovative campaign called we charge genocide the historic petition to the united nations for relief of a crime of the united states against the negro people sought to indict white supremacy and the violence of racial capitalism in the united states organized by the civil rights congress the campaign submitted a petition to the united nations challenging it to live up to its claims of universality supported by the communist party and signed by a host of black leftist luminaries including w e b du bois claudia jones and paul robeson the we charge genocide petition argued that the atrocities of slavery jim crow and contemporary institutionalized violence were on par with the crimes of the nazis since both were genocides aimed at destroying a whole people 22 when the powerful organize legal processes they seem to have unlimited resources at their disposal but when the oppressed try to put the powerful on trial they depend on the volunteer labor of organizers activist journalists scholars witnesses and victims as in any legal process lawyers are important in people s tribunals but their role is fundamentally transformed lawyers even when they attempt radical legal reforms may ultimately if inadvertently be extending the life of the system by contrast the movement lawyers who work in people s tribunals take on the more ambitious project of reimagining the state and projecting new forms of social relations based on equality and solidarity 23 people s tribunals also transform the role of the victims and witnesses who enter the process as individuals or members of broader communities affected by violence in transitional justice true to the neocolonial power relations that underpin it the authoritative expert always confronts a marginalized victim people s tribunals by contrast aim to empower victims through providing ownership over the story sharing the victims experiences thus ceases to be about legitimizing a legal process designed to keep them powerless and bring closure to a revolutionary moment the victims instead become protagonists pursuing the revolution by different means and making a first step in the redistribution of power 24 people s tribunals in our century for franz fanon decolonizing is the process of making the last first this role reversal in the field of justice can assume different forms it could be a straightforward people s tribunal or it could involve a related legal process such as a reparations demand a particularly relevant example of the former is the 2016 international tribunal for democracy in brazil which critically examined the impeachment of president dilma rousseff various social movements including via campesina international the brazil popular front and brazilian jurists for democracy organized the tribunal which also got support from various grassroots groups including the landless workers movement 25 rousseff was impeached on spurious grounds she had moved funds from a federal bank to cover cashflow shortfalls in government programs but this is a common practice among brazilian presidents moreover in doing so she had not violated any federal laws in sharp contrast with rousseff s impeachers many of whom including her successor michel temer have been indicted for corruption 26 the tribunal brought together eight activists from around the world who examined the evidence and heard from many witnesses it unanimously concluded that rousseff s impeachment was in effect a coup that violate all the principles of the democratic process and the brazilian constitutional order 27 this verdict contrasted starkly with the position of u s leaders who immediately established relations with temer s wealthy and almost exclusively white government which lost no time in gutting the country s social programs 28 u s support for the coup in brazil comes as no surprise 29 rather it is consistent with u s positions on recent coups in paraguay and honduras that overthrew democratically elected left governments challenging the region s geopolitical and economic status quo 30 an important achievement of this popular tribunal in brazil was the way it broke with the nation centered myopia of transitional justice by exposing the connections between u s imperial interests and the temer coup so doing the tribunal identified the forces that would soon pave the way for brazil s fascists to win the presidency in 2018 with jair bolsonaro at their head these forces have since been criminalizing activist organizations and targeting resistance paving the way for u s capital to further dispossess and exploit the country 31 if brazil s popular tribunal called attention to a situation quickly spiraling into fascism then the 2018 international people s tribunal in the philippines confronted a fascistoid government already in power 32 organized in brussels by both philippine and international groups the tribunal has exposed and condemned the multiple forms of state violence visited on the people of the philippines since rodrigo duterte became president in 2016 under the guise of an antinarcotics campaign duterte is essentially carrying out a war against the poor in which thousands have been extrajudicially murdered by government forces cases of rape have doubled and millions have lost their jobs 33 the tribunal heard from over thirty victims of human rights violations expert witnesses and community leaders and examined a wide array of documentary evidence 34 it found duterte guilty of fourteen charges including violations of civil and political rights violations of economic social and cultural rights and violations of the right to national self determination 35 donald trump was held to be responsible for the same series of crimes a charge evidently in view of the close longstanding ties between the two countries which have grown even tighter in recent years as tens of millions in military aid including so called aid for narcotics control and law enforcement are channeled to the philippines to counter china s burgeoning role in the region 36 this people s tribunal s willingness to look beyond national frontiers and hound out imperial power relations was also economically sound despite some initial friction it is the united states and its business leaders that stand to benefit from duterte s neoliberal economic policies 37 the u s government was put directly on trial by a pair of innovative people s tribunals these were the 2007 international tribunal on katrina and rita and the 2018 international tribunal on u s colonial crimes against puerto rico the former project which brought together judges from around the world exposed grave state crimes in the wake of a capitalist induced ecological crisis advocating reparations for those internally displaced by the hurricanes the latter convened last year looked at the criminal oppression of puerto rico beginning with the u s conquest in 1898 and up until the devastation wrought by hurricane maria in 2018 the tribunal s final judgement called on the u s government to acknowledge and apologize for colonial crimes committed against the puerto rican people surrender all property and power forcibly taken from the puerto rican people pay reparations to victims of the crime of colonialism alongside people s tribunals there are legal efforts seeking reparations for slavery and colonialism that share the same aim of decolonizing justice putting the dominator rather than the dominated in the dock a key project of this kind is the national coalition of blacks for reparations in america which since 1987 has sought full reparations for black african descendants residing in the united states and its territories for the genocidal war against africans that created the transatlantic slave trade chattel slavery jim crow and chattel slavery s continuing vestiges 38 it is just one example of reparations based justice for instance the caribbean states likewise came together in 2013 to inaugurate a regional body the caricom reparations commission crc seeking compensation to redress the crimes against humanity of native genocide the trans atlantic slave trade and a racialized system of chattel slavery 39 also in namibia the herero people are seeking reparations from the german government for its genocidal practices including a gruesome episode in which sixty five thousand people were exterminated by a colonial general s order 40 as with people s tribunals demands for reparations need to be embedded in a carefully conceived discursive framework critical of the existing world order that is it is important that the financial aspect of the claim form part of a broad strategy of envisioning a just society for without such a strategy lasting structural changes are unlikely and as robin d g kelley reminds us there is no guarantee that they will be accompanied by a new vision and new values 41 one extreme example of this is the post second world war reparations made by germany to the settler colonial state of israel co opting and capitalizing off jewish suffering the zionist political project has employed these funds to dispossess and ethnically cleanse the land of the native palestinian population perpetuating atrocities that many jews themselves had been subject to by the nazis what makes counterhegemonic legal projects of this kind possible it is essential to recognize that although the web connecting law s empire with imperial interests is tight it is not unbreakable both reparations demands and people s tribunals treat legal practices whether national or international as a contested terrain the possibility of doing this that is of upsetting the global norm and opening a window on a truly decolonial and structural justice depends of course on certain conditions of instability in real power relations the law within capitalist states is first and foremost concerned with protecting capital while international law with its origins and structures rooted in capitalist colonialism is usually the handmaiden of imperial domination yet in certain moments of global turbulence it becomes possible to destabilize these norms 42 this is what ayça çubukçu drawing on the work of nancy fraser has argued she claims that in these exceptional moments the hegemonic grammar of human rights and international law comes into question and the what the who and the how of justice become subject at once to substantive debate 43 does such a possibility exist for the tunisian people today the long history of anticolonial resistance that recently resurfaced in the arab revolts and the very ruptures we have observed within the country s transitional justice process point to a possible opening in global power relations the very contested field where a people s tribunal could do its work revolutionary justice in tunisia this possibility looks more like an urgent ethical and strategic necessity the more we reflect on the situation of the tunisian people today that is because on the one hand the country s transitional justice process drew widespread popular support and fueled hope for radical justice what a government report identified as the desire for reforms against systems of tyranny and impunity and the fulfilment of the objectives of the revolution including the dismantlement of the systems of marginalization that have produced the state of inequality 44 on the other hand there was almost no chance that such radical demands would be satisfied without delinking them from the globally endorsed model of justice obviously then an alternative format is needed how else to address the victims manifest desire for structural change in effect a people s tribunal in tunisia could build upon the popular justice claims that erupted into the tdc s discussions as we have seen these open a window on the demands for structural justice that fit into tunisia s long trajectory of revolt both the history of anticolonial resistance and ongoing struggles around land natural resources and police violence could provide rich material for the debates in such a tribunal 45 the aim would not be mere truth telling and catharsis but rather taking the first step if only on a discursive plane toward seeing justice realized in a concrete structural and revolutionary way in that sense a people s tribunal would operate by taking one step further the scattered discursive victories achieved during tunisia s transitional justice process a set of reified narratives is always central to maintaining class relations and only by questioning those stories and reimagining the world can we begin its revolutionary transformation the people s tribunal we are proposing would attempt to pick up subaltern histories from the tunisian context that call into question the ruling class s preferred narratives it is worth enumerating some of these histories both of domination and resistance that are fit for inclusion in such a process the neocolonial designed phosphates industry s destruction of health and environmental conditions which has alienated communities that have long survived off of the land and sea 46 worker resistance to racialized labor exploitation throughout the colonial era which paved the way and participated in nationalist mobilization 47 the forced conscription of tunisians to fight and die on behalf of their colonizers on the front lines of the first world war 48 the violence that crushed the fellagha anticolonial revolt and thus shaped the limited independence that followed the role of the french and u s armed forces in imposing imperial interests and ensuring the incompleteness of tunisia s decolonial process the series of accords signed between france and tunisia at the time of tunisia s managed independence requiring continued security cooperation and tunisian subservience to french imperial interests as expressed in neocolonial contracts enabling the extraction and exploitation of tunisia s natural resources by foreign capital e g cotusal 49 the complicity of western states through the provision of weapons and training to the various security apparatuses with the violent repression of labor and other forms of popular mobilization in the 1968 student uprising and while tunisia underwent neoliberal restructuring the 1978 ugtt organized general strike the 1984 bread intifada against the imf imposed removal of food subsidies and the 2008 gafsa uprising 50 the role of imperialist states especially the united states and the european union in militarizing tunisia s borders imbricating its security institutions into imperial architectures and thereby alienating the state from its people and from the maghrebi arab and african regions in which it is geographically culturally and historically embedded 51 the interference of international financial institutions including the imf and world bank u s agencies such as usaid and regional bodies such as the european union in the processes of law and policymaking through debt conditioned aid and trade deals perpetuating neocolonial resource extraction value drain and the cultural and economic disembedding of tunisia from its natural regional context 52 the role of international financial institutions regional bodies and other imperialist actors in the deliberate dismantlement of tunisian public institutions to the detriment of society as a whole but in particular to working class and marginalized communities that depend on public services as they do not have the ability to access private services the collective and individual agency and complicity of local actors with the extensive foreign intervention in policymaking that has functioned to maintain the coloniality of the structural inequality of power relations and to prevent full decolonization the complicity of western governments in ben ali s consolidation of power and the structural economic political and physical violence exercised against the population at various moments during his rule in particular during the 2008 gafsa uprising and the 2010 11 revolt 53 the complicity of foreign capital and western governments through their silence as well as through the provision of material support with local actors in the violent repression of social movements following the 2010 11 revolt including the protests in kerkannah tataouine el kamour and gafsa the complicity of western countries with local actors in perpetuating the impunity and defaulting on the effort of the repatriation of stolen public money by ben ali and relatives a people s tribunal could address in turn each of these episodes of violence from the history of the tunisian people as in the tribunals discussed earlier in this article defendants would include both domestic and international actors its focus would be on structural violence rather than individual crimes hence transformative rather that retributive justice the process would work to produce results both on a symbolic and an organizational level concretely it would provide a space for political education while in an international context marked by increased skepticism regarding institutionalized politics and political parties it would constitute a platform for coordinating strategies and tactics echoing the bandung and tricontinental conferences it would generate regional and transnational solidarity based on a fuller understanding of the interconnections between diverse anticapitalist and anti imperialist struggles most importantly like those historic examples a people s tribunal would be an effort in self emancipation social movements in tunisia and abroad could use the platform to advance the struggle against the underlying causes of injustice as determined by the oppressed themselves in doing so this people s tribunal would bring us closer to delivering a justice that in the words of the tunisian scholar and activist hèla yousfi is capable of saving dignity individually and collectively 54 notes

call today we will provide you with a review of generally strong first quarter results and execution against our strategic priorities and an update on the transaction with oceanwide first a brief review of our results in the first quarter genworth generated 121 million in adjusted operating income or 0 24 per diluted share compared with adjusted operating income of 125 million or 0 25 per diluted share in the prior year period our global mortgage insurance businesses continue to drive our overall operating performance with strong growth in our u s business in u s mi first quarter adjusted operating income increased 12 year over year to 124 million driven primarily by strong premium growth from higher insurance in force and favorable loss performance in the quarter u s mi generated 9 6 billion in new insurance written or niw as a result of its continued ability to maintain and grow share in the u s market u s mi s capital position remains strong ending the quarter with over 600 million in capital above the revised pmiers requirements which became effective on march 31st in canada adjusted operating income for the first quarter declined 10 year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange to 41 million on lower earned premium and an increase in expenses canada s capital ratio remains well above requirements and our management targets in australia adjusted operating income for the first quarter declined 26 year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange to 14 million primarily driven by lower premiums due to portfolio seasoning our life insurance segment recorded an operating loss of 5 million flat with first quarter of 2018 higher ltc premiums and benefit reductions as a result of our in force rate actions as well as strong equity market performance and lower mortality in our life insurance products were offset by higher new ltc claims severity and frequency results were also impact by less favorable ltc claim terminations year over year achieving actuarially justified premium rate increases and benefit reductions through our ltc rate action plan remains a high strategic priority for genworth these annual ltc premium increases which are intended to address our higher claims experience provides significant leverage to genworth s cash flow as the higher premiums are expected to be paid over decades into the future as shown on slide 10 we received 24 state approvals in the first quarter impacting 241 million of in force premiums with an average annual premium increase of 62 from 2012 through the first quarter of 2019 genworth has achieved approximately 11 billion of approved ltc premium rate increases on an at present value basis let me now turn to the review of the progress made toward completing the oceanwide transaction as previously announced genworth and oceanwide have received all necessary approvals from our u s state insurance regulators fannie mae freddie mac and certain other international jurisdictions oceanwide needs to receive clearance in china for the currency conversion and transfer of funds and they re actively engaged with the relevant chinese regulators over the last several months we have focused our efforts toward obtaining approval from the canadian regulatory authorities our discussion with canadian regulators has been centered around national security matters including data protection and safeguarding our customers personally identifiable information these are important complex issues for which we have significant experience given our success in the design and implementation of the enhanced data security program in connection with the cfius clearance earlier this year we proposed a mitigation approach to canada similar to what was agreed to with cfius we have met with the canadian regulators in person several times to answer their questions and we have provided them with additional information regarding our proposed mitigation we last met with them in the first part of february at that time the canadian regulators informed us that they had the information that they needed to complete their review since then the canadian regulators have been reviewing the matter and we have not received any additional information requests or questions however they have not outlined a time frame for the completion of their review of the transaction to allow additional time for canada s ongoing review genworth and oceanwide announced earlier this week that the parties have agreed to extend the merger agreement from april 30 2019 to june 20 2019 we believe this should provide adequate time for canada to finish their review genworth and oceanwide continue to be actively engaged with other relevant regulators and authorities who have already approved the transaction we believe these parties continue to fully support the transaction i want to thank all the regulators and reviewers of the transaction and all of genworth s and oceanwide s stakeholders for their considerable patience as we work through the final phase of the transaction we recognize that it s been a long and complex process we have received a number of questions from investors analysts regulators and rating agencies regarding oceanwide s and genworth s plans for the 1 5 billion oceanwide post closing capital plan and the 175 million capital commitment to genworth life insurance company or glic from genworth holdings originally the first tranche the 1 5 billion oceanwide capital plan and the first tranche of the 175 million glic contribution were scheduled to be made by march 31st 2019 it is the intention of oceanwide and genworth to address the data of the various tranches in light of the later closing date of the transaction recognizing the important of funding the 1 5 billion oceanwide capital commitment comfortable ahead of the debt maturities in 2020 and 2021 we appreciate the cooperation of all regulators in these discussions finally i want to reaffirm that the genworth board continues to believe the oceanwide transaction represents the best and most certain value to our shareholders genworth and oceanwide remain fully committed to the transaction and we continue to work together to close the transaction as soon as possible at the same time genworth continues to execute against its strategic priorities and improve genworth s overall positioning our most important priorities are to grow earnings to build capital in our mortgage businesses and to strengthen our u s life business through our ltc rate action plan now i will turn the call over to kelly kelly groh chief financial officer thanks tom and good morning everyone today i will cover more detail on our first quarter financial results and key drivers capital levels in our businesses and updates around cash and flexibility at our holding company as the transaction with oceanwide has extended let s begin with this quarter s financial performance we reported net income for the quarter of 174 million and an adjusted operating income of 121 million our mortgage insurance businesses continue to perform well with strong loss ratio performance in the u s and canada and solid capital levels in all the mortgage insurance businesses our u s life and runoff business results were improved collectively with good in force rate action results term life mortality experience and equity market performance our strong results in our mortgage insurance businesses continue to reflect an overall solid macroeconomic environment including steady economic growth low unemployment and interest rate levels and stable housing trends in most markets and at home price levels where we generally provide mortgage insurance coverage our very strong adjusted operating income of 124 million in our u s mortgage insurance business reflected an 8 first quarter reported loss ratio compared to 7 last quarter new delinquencies for the quarter were down modestly on a sequential basis reflecting seasonality we also saw favorable net cures in aging overall insurance in force and u s mi continues to grow reaching an all time high of 170 billion at the end of first quarter 2019 this was up 10 versus last year and reflects strong levels of new insurance written as well as good persistency trends the u s purchase origination market was down versus the prior quarter from seasonality and flat versus the prior year our new insurance written or niw for the quarter was 9 6 billion up 3 sequentially and 7 versus the prior year we expect our u s mi first quarter 2019 estimated market share to increase sequentially we have selectively participated in forward commitment transactions and have continued to successfully role out our proprietary risk based pricing engine genrate and have seen good adoption we continue to manage to an overall return expectation in the mid teens on the 2019 book year new insurance written turning to canada the loss ratio of 15 represents a decrease of three points from the prior quarter on lower average reserves on delinquencies primarily in alberta and the atlantic region and an increase of two points from the prior year on higher new delinquencies net of cures canada s targeted loss ratio for 2019 is 15 25 and the first quarter s performance and expectations for the remainder of the year are in line with those expectations flow niw in canada decreased 33 sequentially from a seasonally smaller origination market and 8 versus the prior year primarily from lower originations resulting from ongoing affordability pressure in larger canadian cities moving to australia the u s gap loss ratio in the quarter was 34 up five points versus the prior quarter from seasonally higher new delinquencies net of cures and up four points versus the prior year mostly from lower earned premiums in the current quarter on australia s ifrs accounting basis the quarterly loss ratio of 55 for the first quarter of 2019 was in line with the full year loss ratio expectations of 45 55 considering the seasonal pattern of higher delinquencies traditionally experienced in the first half of the year our flow new business levels in australia were down 15 versus the prior quarter from a seasonally smaller origination market and up 9 versus the prior year primarily from higher mortgage origination activity from certain lender customers as i mentioned our first quarter results in our u s life segment plus runoff were driven by good in force rate action results in long term care term life mortality experience and equity market performance these results were partially offset by a couple of distinct items i will go through in long term care claim terminations were sequentially higher in the first quarter which is generally consistent with seasonal patterns as we tend to see higher terminations in the first half of the year and lower terminations in the second half of the year compared to last year claim terminations were less favorable although still within our range of expectations new claims following updated utilization assumptions from the fourth quarter of 2018 did reflect higher severity versus prior periods that we expect will continue we did see an incurred but not reported or ibnr benefit during the quarter which offset the incremental new claim expense versus the prior quarter the overall financial benefits of in force rate actions for ltc were better sequentially and versus the prior year as illustrated on page 10 of the investor deck released this morning i do want to spend a minute discussing the ltc rate actions and their impact to our financials we continue to see very good results of our multiyear in force rate action plan and most regulators have been approving actuarily justified rate action requests these approval amounts have been in line with assumptions used in our margin testing and this will continue to be a focus of ours based on last year s margin testing we estimated the need for approximately 6 billion on a net present value basis in anticipated future approved rate actions under actuarial assumptions that were updated in late 2018 our first quarter approvals from a couple large states on a net present value basis were approximately 500 million of the 6 billion remaining as of year end 2018 our multiyear rate action plan assumes it will take approximately 10 years to obtain and implement these remaining approvals and considers the timing and phase in implementation on rate actions previously approved to date for statutory accounting we have recognized ltc claim reserve increases immediately in the quarter we updated assumptions this creates a timing mismatch between the reserve increases and the offsetting implementation of actuarily justified rate actions therefore we may see variability in statutory results and declining risk based capital ratios given the time lag until the premium increase benefits are fully realized and reflected in the financials we plan on continuing to discuss this timing mismatch with our insurance regulators and if in the future any claims reserve strengthening is required based on experience we may seek to better match future premium income benefits with reserve increases for statutory accounting purposes turning to life insurance mortality and term life was lower than both last quarter and last year due primarily to lower claim severity higher variable investment and limited partnership income also drove improved results versus last quarter and last year results in the quarter also included actuarial model updates in universal life totaling 11 million after tax which primarily increased the amortization of deferred acquisition costs while mortality and term life was lower this quarter we have seen mortality for ul trend higher than our prices for assumptions over the last several years i also wanna point out that the term life business continues to be impacted from higher lapses primarily associated with the large 15 year and 20 year level premium term life insurance blocks entering their post level premium periods which result in lower premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs upon lapse given the locked in assumptions under currenting accounting standards we expect this trend to accelerate in 2019 as a larger block of 20 year level premium term business written in 1999 reaches the end of its level premium period in our fixed annuity products we saw favorable mortality versus the prior quarter and prior year results in the quarter also reflected a sequential reduction to reserves associated with fixed indexed annuities driven by the equity market improvement in the quarter this was more than offset by an after tax loss recognition charge of 13 million related to single premium mediated annuities mainly from lower interest rates and turnover in the supporting investment portfolio our loss in the corporate and other segment of 73 million for the quarter was higher than the prior period mainly due to a 12 million expense related to the global and tangible low taxed income or the acronym gilti which i will refer to as gilti provision of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act we have calculated the gilti expense based on our interpretations of the current rules however these interpretations may change as further guidance is issued on this new area of tax law gilti has an impact on our effective tax rate due to the interaction between foreign tax credit carry forward rules utilization of u s net operating loss carry forwards and projected taxable losses in the u s life business the impact to the effective rate is expected to continue through 2020 but is projected to be reduced in future years assuming we return to having positive taxable income after utilizing net operating losses in our u s businesses we do not expect gilti to result in significant cash taxed payments in 2019 or future years we also recorded 13 million additional tax expense in the corporate and other segment driven by the level of capital gains recognized during the quarter the interim financial reporting requirements of apb 28 attempts to smooth your overall tax rate on net income by quarter this timing difference will reverse by the end of the year now i ll move to capital levels where our mortgage insurance businesses continue to maintain very strong capital positions in u s mi we finished the quarter with a pmiers sufficiency ratio of 123 or an excess of more than 600 million above the required assets note this does reflect the revised private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements which were finalized late last year by the federal housing finance agency fhfa and effective for first quarter 2019 reporting in our canada mi business we saw an estimated mortgage insurer capital adequacy test or micat ratio which is the new standard of 172 in the quarter which continues to remain well above the company s operating target range of 160 165 late last year the canadian office of the superintendent of financial institutions or osfi finalized updates to the capital guidelines for mortgage insurers which became effective january 1st 2019 these updates had no significant impact on our reported capital ratio while canada did not execute any extraordinary capital deployment activities during the quarter beyond their ordinary dividends their expectations for 2019 extraordinary capital redeployment are between canadian 400 million and 500 million dollars at current foreign exchange rates that range translates to approximately 120 165 million u s dollars to our holding company and approximately 50 65 million to u s mi our australia mi business ended the quarter with an estimated capital ratio of 201 up from 194 last quarter which is approximately 500 million australian dollars above the high end of the prescribed capital amount or pca management target range of 132 144 the increase in australia s capital ratio reflected continued portfolio seasoning and in force profitability offset by australia s biannual ordinary dividend payment and execution of a portion of their share repurchase initiative of 100 million australian dollars which was announced last quarter capital optimization remains a focus for the business given its excess capital position in fact australia has recently announced that a resolution will be put to shareholders at the company s annual general meeting in may to consider and approve future possibly buybacks of up to 100 million shares over the next 12 month period the genworth holding company received a total of 47 million in net dividends and proceeds from repurchases from our international mortgage insurance subsidiaries during the quarter including 14 million of share buyback proceeds from canada which were held at an intermediate holding company at year end capital in genworth life insurance company or glic ended the first quarter at approximately 195 of company action level rbc this ratio reflects combined statutory profits in our non ltc products offset by ongoing statutory losses and claims growth in ltc as i discussed the benefits of the entire multiyear rate action plan will be implemented over time which will help offset some of the ltc claims pressure given that we ve received a number of questions from investors trying to understand rbc i wanted to take a moment now to clarify a few points when tom or i discuss rbc we generally discuss it in a context of a percentage of required assets on a company action level basis or the point at which a company would need to file a plan of action for improvement with its domiciliary regulator this basis reflects required assets that are twice the authorized control level amounts which is the basis used primarily for regulatory compliance purposes said another way our rbc for glic of approximately 195 on a company action level basis is the same as approximately 390 on an authorized control level basis the minimum level before a plan of action must be filed with a regulator is two times acl required assets or in other words 100 of the company action level risk based capital or three times acl required assets or 150 company action level rbc if the negative trend test rules apply the negative trend test looks at historical loss levels and whether those loss levels would breach certain rbc thresholds none of our companies have breached these levels i also wanna remind investors that as a part of our earlier agreement with delaware regarding the oceanwide transaction genworth will contribute to glic 175 million with the timing of the first tranche consistent with the closing date of the transaction and remaining tranches to be agreed upon with the relevant regulators the contribution to glic is a special one time commitment made in conjunction with the proposed transaction with oceanwide as we have indicated previously it is our intention to manage the u s life entities on a stand alone basis with no future plans to infuse capital in these businesses the u s life businesses will rely on their consolidated statutory capital of approximately 1 9 billion prudent management of in force blocks and the actuarily justified rate actions to satisfy policyholder obligations moving to the holding company we ended the quarter with slightly over 400 million in cash and liquid assets as compared to just over 500 million last quarter our current cash level is approximately 100 million below our targeted two times forward debt service buffer during the quarter total net dividends and proceeds from share repurchases to the holding company were 47 million intercompany tax payments of 30 million were also a source to the holding company during the first quarter offsetting this were interest payments of 71 million that are higher in the first and third quarters given the timing of semiannual interest payments we posted additional cash collateral of 22 million primarily on our hybrid debt interest rate swaps as rates moved lower during the quarter we also had 83 million in other items which included certain employee benefit expenses that trend higher in the first quarter and are mostly replenished by the businesses throughout the remaining quarters of the year we continue to discuss the timing of the 1 5 billion capital plan with oceanwide and our regulators in light of the delay of closing the transaction and we are mindful of the upcoming holding company obligations in addition to approximately 400 million in unsecured debt maturing in june of 20 other near term holding company obligations include the 175 million contribution to glic and the 200 million intercompany note due in march of 2020 the capital commitment from oceanwide along with the existing holding company cash and dividends from our well capitalized mortgage insurance subsidiaries will be key to addressing these items to sum things up for the quarter we remain focused on the operational process including our ltc rate action plan and other strategic actions intended to improve and help stabilize our u s life insurance businesses our mortgage insurance businesses continue to execute on their priorities and are performing very well with solid earnings and strong capital levels with

originally filed with canada shortly after we signed the deal so we signed in october of 2016 and i think we did the form a filing there end of the year in 2016 of course there have been changes to the deal along the way we refiled with the contingency plan capital plan from oceanwide there were some changes by delaware there was a cfius update so you could look at it from their perspective that the deal has changed along the way so i think they and we started more significant discussions in january one of the advantages we have is we spent significant time with cfius and it s also like in canada a complex mitigation plan that has a lot of different pieces to it and so we had discussions with them several meetings as i mentioned the last was early february what my understanding is is they have said they have all the information they need unfortunately they haven t really given us a time frame for when they ll finish the review and there are several different agencies that are reviewing the mitigation plan and the filing overall ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research thanks and then the second question was within any of the regulatory approvals or the merger agreement can you just remind us are there any requirements in terms of specifics toward china oceanwide s financial conditions and are they required to hold any sort of assets in any escrow accounts tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer no there are none of those requirements clearly as time goes on and we have year end 2018 financials and i m sure those when they re finished by china oceanwide they will be submitted to all the regulators virginia is our lead regulator and they re coordinating with all the other regulators and with us obviously they re here based in richmond where we are so it s very convenient for us to have all those discussions virginia s been very supportive of the transaction they ve of course approved it and so in addition to our work with our teams with all of the regulators keeping them all up to date virginia is also coordinating from an overall regulatory perspective but there are no specific requirements obviously the regulators until the deal closes they ll continue to review anything that s new and new information that s sort of the normal course ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research i guess this is more of a question about china oceanwide but do they have i guess liquid assets currently in excess of the purchase price tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer so ryan in the delaware hearing a significant part of the focus of the hearing was on china oceanwide financial resources and so as part of the filings with all the regulators plus as updated by the china oceanwide representatives they went through all that we obviously have been doing our own due diligence and so they have significant financial assets and cash one of the challenges that we still have is ultimately once we wrap up with canada is the chinese regulators will have to decide how much of the purchase price can come from the assets that china oceanwide has in mainland china versus offshore and as you ll recall along the way a year or so ago i think we worked on a contingent plan so i think both china oceanwide and genworth have worked on a plan so that we feel very comfortable regardless of how safe comes out in terms of the conversion of the currency and the funding we have both our original plan which had all of the proceeds coming from the excess assets and excess cash in china but we also have a contingency plan if the regulators in china put a limit on that so we feel very comfortable both oceanwide and genworth that there are assets both within china and outside that are more than adequate to fund the transactions and also to fund the 1 5 billion capital plan ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research thank you operator as a reminder please press 1 to ask a question the next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore please go ahead tom gallagher evercore senior managing director good morning kelly your comment on rbc potentially going down just given the lag between the rate approvals and the benefits there versus a more immediate potential strengthening of gross long term care reserves based on what you re seeing right now would you anticipate a meaningful impact to rbc and i guess if it is is there a contingency plan like do you think you d be able to file for permitted practice particularly if you think the regulators see that it s just truly just a timing issue kelly groh chief financial officer thanks for the question tom and good morning i think it s a great question we continually look at our risk based capital forecast and our operating plans over a multiyear time horizon permitted practices similar to what ge had done on their very large increase are certain things that we would consider to talk to the regulators over time it depends on the facts and circumstances that we run into at that period of time but as you saw even the first quarter we started putting up higher average claims and it will take time to file and then implement the rate actions associated with those higher claim levels now regarding our forecast right now we don t have a forecast that shows us going into a scenario where it would require us to submit a plan of action with our regulators so it is a discussion we would continue to have with our regulators but our forecast currently does not show that tom gallagher evercore senior managing director thanks and then just on that same topic can you talk a bit about what kind of change there was percentage terms was it a meaningful increase in both severity and frequency in terms of the long term care claims i think if i look back to your 2018 filing frequency didn t change too much severity was up in the teens can you quantify at all what kind of trend change you saw on the first quarter kelly groh chief financial officer tom i don t have that in front of me right now we d be happy to evaluate whether or not there s some meaningful information that investors could gain from that and figure out what level of granularity we can also look at if there s anything in our 10 q that would be adequate when we file that so we ll have to get back to you on that one tom gallagher evercore senior managing director great and then just as it relates to the rate increases you ve clearly been having more success there if you look at 17 it was a little less than 30 45 in 2018 and now to start the year you re at 60 rate increase weighted average can you talk a little bit about what s going on with the state are we seeing that level because some of the bottlenecks or states that weren t granting rate increases are now coming through or are you actually seeing just higher across the board rate increases occurring and where would you expect that trend to go tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer so tom that s a great question and it s a complex question because every state in the district of columbia so 51 jurisdictions does it somewhat differently i do think from if you look back over the last five or six years 2013 14 i think it was difficult receiving the large increases triple digit type increases from any of the states i think that has changed i think over the last five or six years genworth and all of the other long term care insurers with legacy blocks have provided a lot of information to the regulators and so i would say all regulators recognize that there are significant needs for actuarily justified premium increases i would say generally there has been 40 45 states who are doing significantly well from our perspective and i think other insurers perspective and really stepping up and giving significant premium increases on some policy forums we re over 200 cumulative increases and i think we ve said in the past that the most problematic legacy policies are those that have unlimited number of years of coverage and 5 compound inflation protection and that we need 300 type increases and so if you look at our cumulative net present value of 11 billion now at the end of the first quarter versus our original target that has grown but it s that 16 5 billion we re around two thirds and if you look at the average from those 40 45 states we re in pretty good shape there are some states that are behind and so i do believe that one of the challenges in the industry and among the 50 states is there are some states that are very far along in giving very significant premium increases to genworth and to other companies and then there are other states that are well behind and i do think there is pressure coming from the majority of states against those few states that are behind and so i do think you will see and in some cases your hypothesis was right that some of the large increases that we ve received lately have come from states that have a ways to catch up and i think ultimately all the regulators in the naic i think really have to in my perspective figure out a more consistent basis for granting premium increases now that i think there s no question that these increases are needed and are actuarily justified but we don t have homogeneity across all the states in terms of how they do it everyone is somewhat different and so i do think more and more states that are in pretty good shape along the way they have more to do but they really i think have done a great job in terms of managing this and i think they need to put some pressure on their fellow regulators and commissioners to step up more and so hopefully we ll see that tom gallagher evercore senior managing director that s helpful thanks tom operator once again please press 1 to ask a question the next question comes from jimmy bhullar from jp morgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar jp morgan equity research analyst hi good morning i joined the call late so i don t know if you ve covered this topic but can you sort of talk about if there s a possibility that if the merger approval process continues or the acquisition approval process continues to get delayed is there a point at which you might need to go and reseek the approvals that you ve already obtained so is there an expiration date or is there a way for the regulators to sort of ask you to restart the process beyond a certain point tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer jimmy that s a good question there have been questions before you joined on a deal progress b but that specific question hasn t come up what i would say is that we have a lead regulator virginia that has approved the deal and it s coordinating with all the regulators and we have a specific team led by our general counsel ward bobitz who s focused discussions with all the regulators so i think we really kept all the regulators up to speed i think the regulators that have approved the deal remain very supportive of the transaction obviously we will update them along the way obviously each quarter we have financial statements that we release so we provide those and then my expectation would be that some of the public companies that filed 2018 sometime in may those financials become available and i think we ll submit those but i do not see any of the other regulators who ve already approved undoing their approval if you will i think they ll continue to want to see new information just with the passage of time and i think the focus now really is on canada and we discussed that on a previous question but we ve learned in the cfius process that it takes time to go through these mitigations plans it s not something that any of these regulators including canada have brought experience in so it s new we were fortunate in the case of canada that we had a very good model in cfius i think that was a very strong mitigation plan so that s the basis that we ve used we ve gone back and forth with canada what i said on the call earlier is the last meeting we had with them was in early february at that time they told us that they had the information they needed to review the transaction obviously we extended again to june 30 and we think that should be enough time for them to finish their process and it s really canada that s left and i think the other regulators that have already approved are still very supportive of the deal jimmy bhullar jp morgan equity research analyst and then can you share any insight that you have on oceanwide s financing for the transaction i don t think there s an escrow account that the money s sitting in but do you have any views on how they re gonna finance it tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer so that question did come up before and it s a good question so in the process both genworth and all the regulators have done due diligence on china oceanwide and the funding and there is significant excess cash and capital within mainland china that china oceanwide has as you know because you and i have talked about this before several months ago maybe even a year ago we did come up with a contingency plan to the extent that safe ultimately limits the amount of currency conversion within mainland china oceanwide does have a contingency plan that has cash and other capital as well as financing outside of china so we believe that whether the deal is funded primarily from china or outside under the contingency plan that oceanwide is in very good shape in terms of being prepared once we get the final approvals from canada to move forward and close the deal and that they have adequate cash and capital to not only provide the purchase price of 2 7 billion but also the 1 5 billion capital that s due over time post to closing jimmy bhullar jp morgan equity research analyst thank you good luck tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thank you jimmy operator the next question comes from alex scott from goldman sachs please go ahead alex scott goldman sachs equity research analyst hi i just had a quick one on long term care i know the regulators had some i guess enhanced disclosure on the actuarial guidance 51 that was issued for year end 18 and i d just be interested in any feedback you got through that process i think there was a focus on morbidity assumptions and more specifically incidence curves so i d be interested if you got any color in terms of how some of those assumptions compare to the industry through that process kelly groh chief financial officer thanks for the question alex i think those conversations are ongoing all the carriers just recently submitted their cash flow testing memorandum and i think the regulators are methodically looking through all of that and having discussions we feel like we re very compliant with actuarial guideline 51 and that all of our methods are very supportable based on our experience and with appropriate provisions for adverse deviation alex scott goldman sachs equity research analyst all right thank you operator as there are no further questions signaled i will now return the call back to your host mr mcinerney tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thank you very much klina and thanks to all of you for your time and questions today we appreciate your continued investment and interest in genworth and we recognize that the oceanwide transactions approval process has been very frustrating and it s obviously taken longer than any of us expected but please be assured that oceanwide and genworth are working very hard to close the transaction as soon as possible and thank you very much for being on the call this morning operator that will conclude today s call thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen you may now disconnect duration 49 minutes call participants tim owens vice president of investor relations tom mcinerney

financial statements and notes financial statements and arc s management s discussion and analysis md a as at and for the three months ended march 31 2019 are available on arc s website at www arcresources com and as filed on sedar at www sedar com arc advanced several key projects in the first quarter of 2019 including obtaining regulatory approval for multiple phases of development at attachie west an area that will provide our company with liquids rich opportunities for many years to come explained myron stadnyk arc s president and chief executive officer we are executing on a strategy that is founded on full cycle returns and overall profitability of the business with a compelling asset base coupled with a clean balance sheet and a current attractive yield arc is positioned to create shareholder value arc delivered excellent operational results in the first quarter of 2019 achieving record quarterly production of 139 054 barrels of oil equivalent boe per day managing the company s operating expense of 5 24 per boe and recording zero lost time incidents for employees and contractors arc s 2019 capital program of 775 million is focused on investing in multi year development projects to grow the company s liquids production at attachie west and dawson in northeast british columbia and at ante creek in northern alberta approximately 295 million of the planned 775 million capital budget will be invested in facilities pipelines and water infrastructure with the majority of the production associated with these infrastructure projects expected to be added in 2020 and 2021 arc has made significant progress in its 2019 plan to date capital expenditures totaled 213 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 approximately 53 million of which was invested in major infrastructure projects an active drilling and completions program in the first quarter will deliver oil and liquids rich production through the remainder of the year and arc s plan to redirect 60 mmcf per day of natural gas currently flowing through a third party facility to arc s sunrise phase ii facility in the second quarter of 2019 will eliminate third party processing fees and improve the company s operating expense in 2019 arc expects to generate funds from operations in excess of its anticipated 2019 dividends of approximately 210 million and sustaining capital 1 requirements of approximately 400 million discretionary funds from operations in excess of dividend and sustaining capital requirements and the redeployment of cash proceeds from previously completed non core dispositions are being invested in key multi year development projects that will grow the company s liquids production looking ahead to the second quarter of 2019 arc s operations will be affected by third party pipeline maintenance significant turnarounds and anticipated spring break up impacts to production and field operations as such production is expected to be approximately five per cent lower and arc s operating expense per boe is expected to be approximately 10 per cent higher than the first quarter of 2019 arc expects that production will ramp up through the second half of 2019 as final transportation arrangements come into effect at sunrise and initial production from a multi well pad currently being drilled at the liquids rich attachie west area is brought on stream in the fourth quarter of 2019 arc s full year 2019 operating expense is expected to be within the guidance range of 5 30 to 5 70 per boe and full year 2019 average daily production is expected to be within the guidance range of 135 000 to 142 000 boe per day 1 sustaining capital refers to estimated capital expenditures to maintain production from existing facilities at current production levels sustaining capital does not have any standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities key takeaways from arc s financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2019 include production delivered average daily production of 139 054 boe per day a two per cent increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 with increased natural gas production at sunrise phase ii partially offset by lower production in alberta due to cold weather funds from operations funds from operations totaled 186 2 million 0 53 per share lower realized gain on risk management contracts and foreign exchange and higher general and administrative g a expense due to increases in the valuation of arc s share based compensation awards were the primary drivers in the decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018 capital program advanced key infrastructure projects at dawson ante creek and attachie west in order to build out future processing capacity arc also executed on its drilling and completions program to maintain production at existing infrastructure at or near capacity attachie west regulatory approval obtained regulatory approval for the construction of the attachie west phase i facility along with the approval for multiple future phases of expansion low cost structure continued to manage arc s low cost structure with a first quarter 2019 operating expense of 5 24 per boe crude oil and liquids pricing benefited from the tightening of canadian oil differentials with the average realized price for crude oil increasing 47 per cent and the average realized price for condensate increasing 13 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 natural gas sales diversification strategy continued to realize the benefits of arc s physical and financial

s md a 3 approximately 3 700 barrels per day of non core crude oil production was divested in 2018 4 arc has adopted the standard six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil ratio when converting natural gas to boe boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different than the energy equivalency of the 6 1 conversion ratio utilizing the 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value 5 non gaap measure that does not have any standardized meaning

takeaways for additional commentary on arc s financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2019 please view the following videos myron s minute arc resources q1 2019 financial review and arc resources q1 2019 operations review available on arc s website at www arcresources com commodity price environment arc employs an integrated approach to its physical marketing and financial risk management programs which is underpinned by a strong understanding of market fundamentals arc uses market fundamental analysis to set a view on the outlook for commodity prices to drive decisions across the business this detailed analysis provides the basis for arc s financial hedging and physical marketing strategies which help to reduce cash flow volatility diversify price risk and also supports arc s strategic planning and budgeting processes arc regularly monitors commodity prices and market conditions and has the flexibility to adjust the investment levels and pace of development of its capital plans accordingly crude oil and liquids the outlook on global crude oil prices improved considerably in the first quarter of 2019 reflecting the impact that opec members compliance with output cuts and us imposed sanctions on iran have had on the global supply demand balance locally the alberta government s mandatory oil production curtailment which came into effect in january 2019 had a significant tightening effect on canadian oil differentials while arc s physical oil production was not impacted by the mandated production curtailment in the first quarter of 2019 its corporate crude oil and condensate realizations did benefit from the tighter differentials with average crude oil realizations increasing 47 per cent and average condensate realizations increasing 13 per cent relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 the majority of arc s crude oil production is made up of conventional light oil and condensate which continue to realize premium pricing relative to heavier crude oil grades natural gas cold weather conditions and strong winter demand in western canada resulted in relatively strong local natural gas prices in the first quarter of 2019 despite withdrawal season ending with storage levels below the five year average local egress is expected to be constrained through the summer months as third party maintenance and planned outages get underway which may lead to pricing volatility in the us natural gas prices moderated after a strong fourth quarter of 2018 when higher prices were driven by cold weather and declining inventories the near term outlook for us natural gas prices is expected to be range bound given that growing production is expected to be largely met with strong domestic and export demand arc maintains a strategy to physically and financially diversify its realized natural gas price to multiple north american downstream sales points in order to mitigate the impact of pricing volatility and to increase exposure to more attractive markets approximately 48 per cent of arc s corporate natural gas volumes are exposed to a combination of us midwest henry hub malin and dawn pricing hubs in 2019 and 23 per cent of corporate natural gas volumes are exposed to aeco and station 2 prices the remaining 29 per cent is financially hedged as a result of this diversification strategy less than 10 per cent of arc s expected commodity sales revenue is exposed to the aeco and station 2 markets in 2019 2019 capital budget and near term plan arc s 2019 capital budget was designed to create value through the development of a compelling suite of multi year projects to increase arc s productive capacity and pay a meaningful dividend to shareholders arc s near term plan to 2021 includes the development of five infrastructure projects with a continued commitment to maintain arc s monthly dividend of 0 05 per share and the overall profitability of the business the plan s pace of development supports arc s enduring principle of strong balance sheet performance and controlling arc s corporate decline rate to achieve leading capital efficiencies and grow arc s liquids production the development plan for 2019 to 2021 includes the following projects which to varying degrees are all currently underway sunrise phase ii bringing the newly constructed 180 mmcf per day sunrise gas processing facility to full capacity in 2019 the initial 60 mmcf per day of processing and sales capacity is currently in use and the remaining balance will be available in june 2019 once final transportation arrangements are in place the exact timing and pace at which the production is brought on stream will be commodity price dependent dawson phase i ii upgrading the dawson phase i ii gas processing facility with liquids handling capabilities by year end 2019 dawson phase iv constructing and bringing the liquids rich dawson phase iv gas processing and liquids handling facility on production in the second quarter of 2020 ante creek 10 36 expanding the ante creek 10 36 facility to grow the area s light oil production scheduled for completion in the second quarter of 2020 attachie west phase i advancing infrastructure development at attachie west to commission and bring to capacity the first phase of gas processing and liquids handling in 2021 arc obtained regulatory approval for the first phase of development along with approval for multiple future phases of expansion in the first quarter of 2019 arc s disciplined capital plan was designed to deliver profitable growth through investing funds from operations generated from existing businesses and the remaining proceeds from previously completed non core asset dispositions arc regularly monitors commodity prices and market conditions to ensure that first and foremost its balance sheet and dividend are protected arc s plan is expected to generate strong economic returns and deliver meaningful production and cash flow per share growth with balanced cash inflows and outflows over the long term arc will continue to manage conservative debt levels as a priority targeting a net debt to annualized funds from operations ratio of between 1 0 and 1 5 times and will continue to monitor prevailing commodity prices and market conditions should conditions change such that they adversely impact arc s ability to effectively and profitably deliver on its strategic plans arc will adjust its investment levels and pace of development accordingly financial review balance sheet and capital allocation arc maintains financial flexibility through its strong balance sheet with 796 3 million of net debt outstanding at march 31 2019 and a net debt to annualized funds from operations ratio of 1 1 times arc had an additional 1 4 billion of cash and credit capacity available at the end of the first quarter of 2019 taking into account the company s working capital surplus arc s credit facility is currently undrawn in 2019 arc expects to generate funds from operations in excess of its anticipated 2019 dividends of approximately 210 million and sustaining capital 1 requirements of approximately 400 million discretionary funds from operations in excess of dividend and sustaining capital requirements and the redeployment of cash proceeds from previously completed non core dispositions are being invested in key development projects arc s outlook is that once the productive capacity at dawson phase iv is brought on line in 2020 the company will be able to fund its dividends and sustain and grow its business entirely out of funds from operations at moderate commodity price levels at that time arc will have the option to pursue one or a combination of the following with the company s unallocated funds from operations debt reduction future development opportunities initiating a share buyback program and increasing its dividend 1 sustaining capital refers to estimated capital expenditures to maintain production from existing facilities at current production levels sustaining capital does not have any standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities net income loss arc recognized a net loss of 54 6 million 0 15 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 159 7 million 0 45 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and net income of 54 9 million 0 16 per share in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease in earnings is primarily attributed to an unrealized loss recorded on the mark to market of arc s risk management contracts and no gain recognized from the disposal of non core assets in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018 the impact of these items was partially offset by reduced deferred income taxes and an increase in unrealized gain on foreign exchange resulting from the revaluation of arc s us dollar denominated debt funds from operations arc s first quarter 2019 funds from operations of 186 2 million 0 53 per share decreased by 22 4 million 0 06 per share relative to fourth quarter 2018 funds from operations of 208 6 million 0 59 per share commodity sales revenue from crude oil and liquids increased 24 5 million 0 07 per share relative to the prior quarter however a reduced realized gain on risk management contracts of 25 1 million 0 07 per share and a reduced realized gain on foreign exchange of 13 1 million 0 04 per share were the most significant contributors to the lower funds from operations in the period also serving to decrease funds from operations was increased g a expense of 11 8 million 0 03 per share reflecting the increase in the fair value of arc s share based compensation plans due to the appreciation in arc s common share price during the first quarter of 2019 funds from operations for the first quarter of 2019 decreased 14 8 million 0 04 per share from first quarter 2018 funds from operations of 201 0 million 0 57 per share lower commodity sales from crude oil and liquids due to both a decrease in volumes and pricing reduced realized gain on risk management contracts and increased transportation expense were the primary drivers in lower funds from operations year over year partially offsetting these items were higher commodity sales from natural gas due to higher volumes and improved pricing and lower royalties and

netback prior to gain on risk management contracts for the first quarter of 2019 increased 12 per cent from the fourth quarter of 2018 this was primarily due to strengthened crude oil and condensate pricing arc s operating netback including gain on risk management contracts decreased one per cent in the first quarter of 2019 with a reduced realized gain on risk management contracts offsetting the positive impact that stronger crude oil and condensate pricing had on arc s operating netback arc s first quarter 2019 royalties decreased nine per cent from the fourth quarter of 2018 and decreased 38 per cent from the first quarter of 2018 lower royalties reflect the sliding scale effect that commodity prices have on royalty rates as well as the increase in arc s natural gas production which is subject to lower relative royalty rates compared to crude oil and liquids royalties for the three months ended march 31 2019 were 19 0 million arc s operating expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased four per cent from the fourth quarter of 2018 and was largely driven by higher electrical expenses and increased labour expenses related to arc s share based compensation plans arc s first quarter 2019 operating expense decreased 17 per cent relative to the first quarter of 2018 and is the combination of bringing on new montney production with lower relative costs to operate and disposing of non core assets with higher relative costs to operate throughout 2018 operating expense for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 65 6 million arc expects that its operating expense per boe in the second quarter of 2019 will be higher than the first quarter by approximately 10 per cent due to third party pipeline maintenance significant turnarounds and anticipated spring break up impacts to production and field operations arc s full year 2019 operating expense is expected to be within the guidance range of 5 30 to 5 70 per boe arc s transportation expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased 11 per cent relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased 13 per cent relative to the first quarter of 2018 the increase in transportation expense is primarily due to additional transportation agreements which have been assigned temporarily to a third party as part of arc s physical marketing diversification efforts and is directly offset by an increase to revenue there is no impact to arc s operating netback or funds from operations as a result of these agreements transportation expense for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 37 0 million operational review arc s position in the montney resource play is made up of approximately 1 100 net sections of land approximately 714 000 net acres with production from these assets representing greater than 90 per cent of total corporate production arc s history of disciplined execution in the montney has positioned the company to deliver excellent capital and operating efficiencies and generate strong rates of return on its projects owned and operated infrastructure affords arc greater control over costs and the production mix of its liquids recovery strong safety and environmental performance and the ability to manage a flexible pace of development arc looks to optimize well designs and maximize well value pursue technological advancements and work with service providers to preserve its

activities arc actively monitors market conditions and executes a strategy that proactively secures takeaway capacity for future development projects mitigates the impact of third party infrastructure outages and diversifies arc s sales portfolio to ensure that production gets to market at optimal pricing capital expenditures arc s first quarter 2019 capital expenditures before land and net property acquisitions and dispositions totaled 213 7 million capital investment was focused on arc s montney assets with 21 wells drilled 12 oil wells and nine liquids rich wells and 28 wells completed and the advancement of several infrastructure projects including the dawson phase i and ii liquids handling facility upgrade the dawson phase iv facility the ante creek 10 36 facility expansion project and initial investments for the first phase of development at attachie west arc s 2019 capital program of 775 million is focused on drilling to maintain production at existing infrastructure at or near capacity while investing in building out future processing capacity the following table outlines the number of wells drilled and completed in each of arc s core operating areas three months ended march 31 2019 area wells drilled wells completed dawson 7 5 parkland tower 8 7 sunrise 9 ante creek 6 7 total 21 28 production average daily production of 139 054 boe per day in the first quarter of 2019 was comprised of 26 461 barrels per day of light oil and condensate 7 183 barrels per day of ngls and 633 mmcf per day of natural gas arc s first quarter 2019 average daily production was two per cent higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 with increased natural gas production at the sunrise phase ii facility partially offset by lower production in alberta due to cold weather average daily production in the first quarter of 2019 increased six per cent relative to the first quarter of 2018 and was predominantly the result of arc s continued focus on the liquids rich lower montney at dawson and new natural gas production at the sunrise phase ii facility partially offsetting these increases to production was the disposal of approximately 4 700 boe per day of non core production throughout 2018 arc expects that production during the second quarter of 2019 will be lower than the first quarter by approximately five per cent due to third party pipeline maintenance significant turnarounds and anticipated spring break up impacts to production and field operations arc expects that production will ramp up through the second half of 2019 as final transportation arrangements come into effect at sunrise and initial production from a multi well pad currently being drilled at the liquids rich attachie west area is brought on stream in the fourth quarter of 2019 full year 2019 average daily production is expected to be within the guidance range of 135 000 to 142 000 boe per day attachie arc s attachie property is a highly prospective montney

production at attachie west averaged 3 300 boe per day in the first quarter of 2019 comprised of 1 800 barrels per day of condensate and 9 mmcf per day of natural gas arc expects current production levels to continue to decrease moderately through the second and third quarters of 2019 as existing wells on production naturally decline and are shut in for offset frac operations production is expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2019 when initial production from the multi well pad that is currently being drilled is brought on stream the liquids processing capacity at attachie west s battery is 3 500 barrels per day arc invested 16 million at attachie west during the first quarter of 2019 primarily directed at initial drilling and lease construction costs for a 10 well pad the multi well pad is focused on well design optimization to maximize well productivity and improve capital efficiencies and will provide data to finalize the technical design for commercial development at attachie west there are currently two active rigs on site and completion activities are scheduled for the second half of the year with initial production expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 in the first quarter of 2019 arc obtained regulatory approval for the construction of its attachie west phase i facility along with the approval for multiple future phases of expansion attachie west phase i is being designed to process 60 mmcf per day of natural gas 10 000 barrels per day of condensate and 4 000 barrels per day of ngls the facility is expected to be brought on stream in 2021 and initial egress and long term takeaway capacity for production has been secured on transcanada corporation s north montney mainline as part of the first phase of development at attachie west arc invested in the construction of a major access road for the area during the first quarter of 2019 the arc owned and operated access road extends over 20 kilometres and will help reduce the area s operating expense and improve capital efficiencies dawson arc s flagship dawson property is a low cost montney natural gas and liquids rich natural gas play where arc has a land position of 137 net sections approximately 89 000 net acres the dawson play delivers strong economics and cash flow at prevailing natural gas prices and is further enhanced by the growing liquids rich production being

the prior year period while average delivered pulpwood prices increased 1 to 45 15 per ton versus 44 52 per ton in the prior year period the decrease in delivered sawtimber prices was driven by uncertainty in the export market resulting from the ongoing trade dispute between the u s and china as well as weaker u s lumber markets the increase in delivered pulpwood prices was driven primarily by geographic mix operating loss of 3 7 million versus operating income of 4 7 million in the prior year period was primarily due to lower net stumpage prices 6 1 million lower volumes 1 9 million

decreased 4 to 83 42 per ton versus 87 02 per ton in the prior year period the decrease in export sawtimber prices was primarily due to increased competition from lower cost lumber imports and alternative species the decrease in domestic sawtimber prices in u s dollar terms was driven primarily by the fall in the nz us exchange rate us 0 68 per nz 1 00 versus us 0 72 per nz 1 00 excluding

year volume guidance although we anticipate lower quarterly harvest volumes for the remainder of the year as we experienced above average stumpage removals in the first quarter we continue to expect that average pricing in southern timber will improve modestly with price increases in certain regions moderated by geographic mix on a weighted average basis in our pacific northwest timber segment we expect to achieve our full year volume guidance with increased harvest volumes in the second half of the year while we anticipate that any prospective pricing improvements will be largely dependent on a resolution of the u s china trade dispute in our new zealand timber segment we similarly expect to achieve our full year volume guidance with increased quarterly harvest volumes for the balance of the year while we continue to expect that year over year pricing will be relatively stable with some fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our real estate segment we are on track to achieve our full year adjusted ebitda guidance although quarterly results may vary conference call a conference call and live audio webcast will be held on thursday may 2 2019 at 10 00 am edt to discuss these results

bullying nigeria despite admitting the government s modest achievements the bretton woods institutions bullied nigeria during the 2019 article iv consultation for non implementation of their market reforms but the sharp contrasts between their policy recommendations for nigeria and usa s growth stimulating and employment generating fiscal policy as well as ghana s new fiscal paradigm comprehensive tax reduction elimination towards boosting local manufacturing for job creation show that they lack understanding of the critical needs of the nigerian economy bullying africa s largest economy s management is worsened by the fact that nigeria is still licking the wounds of capital flight real sector divestment double digit inflation unemployment hike collapse of infrastructure and manufacturing sector etc since 1987 sap that destroyed the economy like ghana s after busia s 1971 economic liberalization programme also the imf economists landmark report on the privatization of british railways after 25 years described its benefits as an illusion the tendency of governments to focus on debt misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices when public assets are taken into account selling a public utility for example may do nothing to improve the public finances privatizations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government s asset holdings similarly cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets which could cost more in the long term it asserted uk economy requires fundamental structural shift uk sindependent newspaper 09 10 2018 thus while both institutions are preoccupied with market reform economic ratios nigeria is more preoccupied with re building her market s body in its convalescence from recession than with the performance ratios of some of its struggling parts moreover because she opted for a fundamental structural shift through the yet gestating slower pace growth but more sustainable agriculture led economic diversification strategy into the non oil sector by developing and exploiting the hitherto latent resources for import substitution and exports in contradistinction from the previous import all importables regimes a correlate of this strategy is the necessity for incentives subsidies like usa s for soybeans farmers for many nursery bed greenhorn projects that would otherwise collapse with disastrous macro economic consequences also critical human capital maintenance demands saving millions of children elderly resource handicapped professionals and commercial operators from the morgues as the most vulnerable victims of socio economic abuse with multi dimensional safety net programmes hence while the institutions have embarked on frontal attacks on nigeria s fiscal and monetary policy measures with zestful orthodoxy and possibly developing a covert encirclement strategy of limiting nigeria s access to external loans outside the paris club framework the government seems to have formulated its own counter offensive strategy with its sap supported with position and flanking defence tactics for controlling inflation stabilizing interest and exchange rates increasing foreign reserves and attracting billions in fdi mous the impasse from this policy conflict between their recommendations and the government s studious taciturnity demands a détente for congruence between both sap versions achieving that congruence demands that the institutions understand the contents contexts and depth of nigeria s key economic challenges towards proffering effective long term solutions for them loss misuse of resources for achieving faster economic growth e g post debt relief 60 billion increase in external debt between 2007 and 2015 without concrete collateral assets and their measurable contributions to the gdp for which the economy is being penalized with humongous servicing costs at a time of reduced revenue with resultant surge in debt servicing revenue ratio while more external loans are required to reduce the disastrous effects of infrastructural collapse from the poor non use of the 60 billion and accessing low cost financing for critical infrastructure without policy summersaults that can destabilize the socio economic structure and trigger political instability indeed nigeria s situation is similar to mengitsu s regime in pulling ethiopia from its junk status like rawlings regimes whose unconventional bottom up economic re development was the base for ghana s current economic triumphalism also obama s recession cure therapy on which trump s regime is building is another model for implementing nigeria s economic re development programme this is why the new direction of bottom up economic re development offers more hope than returning to the top down superficial and seedy market reform blunders of phantasmal short term promises with long term disasters of mass pauperisation but the ratios being applied to nigeria s economy were not applied for these countries during their turbulent re development periods by the institutions moreover the chicken and egg debate on prioritizing funding for human capital over physical infrastructural development is highly misplaced as an example medical doctors migrate to other countries routinely due to decades old collapse of the healthcare infrastructure despite the need for their services and the financial scourge of medical tourism hence government s prioritizing infrastructure over human capital development with inadequate resources for both objectives simultaneously is rational in the long run for reducing the loss of its critical manpower especially as the private sector is bridging the gaps with 80 universities the world bank s pledge to help africa tackle illicit fund flows will benefit nigeria immensely especially if it includes the idea of establishing a un court on corruption but the world bank s pressure on nigeria to sign afcfta whether or not it is in line with her need assessment and the concurrent logs in her economic fireplace is out of order she should not be swash buckled into signing it if its impact is potentially detrimental to her economic development plans also if imf commits to working with nigeria to achieve faster economic growth through low cost financing of very critical infrastructure its criticisms of nigeria s loans from china and other low cost sources is trivial rather imf should correct the defects of the paris club template for obtaining patronage of its loans by needy countries therefore the bretton woods institutions bullying tactics on the nigerian government that openly signals a sharp conflict in strategy and breakdown in their relationships can be easily redressed through their improved understanding of the key challenges objectives and strategies in charting a sustainable growth path and full commitment to working together through a mutual détente this can thaw the frosty relationship between them because nobody can build anything on nothing anywhere in the world
q1 2019 sales of 624 million gaap diluted eps of 0 11 and adjusted diluted eps 1 of 0 16 at top end of guidance range of 0 16 at top end of guidance range company announces land purchase in bangladesh for approximately 45 million as part of major south east asian capacity expansion initiative to support international growth company reaffirms sales and adjusted diluted eps guidance for 2019 1 please refer to definition and reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in this press release montreal may 01 2019 globe newswire all amounts are in u s dollars except where otherwise indicated gildan activewear inc gil tsx and nyse today announced its results for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 and updated its full year guidance the company also announced the completion of the purchase of a sizable land parcel in bangladesh as part of its new capacity expansion initiative to develop large scale vertically integrated manufacturing in south east asia to support expected sales growth results for the first quarter were in line with expectations setting the company on track to deliver on its full year sales and eps targets for 2019 gaap diluted eps for the first quarter totaled 0 11 and consistent with the company s guidance as updated on march 26 2019 adjusted diluted eps of 0 16 came in at the high end of the company s guidance range of 0 14 to 0 16 as expected earnings were down for the quarter versus last year due to anticipated factors including the impact on sales from lower levels of distributor restocking and higher raw material and other input cost pressures in addition the earnings decline reflected a 0 12 per share trade accounts receivable impairment charge primarily related to the wind down of the heritage sportswear operations which is under receivership as previously announced on march 26 2019 net sales were down 3 6 in the first quarter and were better than the company s guidance which called for a decline in the mid to high single digit range primarily due to stronger than anticipated sales of fleece products and an earlier start of initial shipments of the company s new private label men s underwear program which will be available to consumers in the second quarter during the quarter we continued to execute on supply chain initiatives aimed at driving increased operational efficiency across our manufacturing base and from which cost benefits are expected to start materializing meaningfully in the fourth quarter of 2019 and benefiting gross margins in 2020 we also continued with efforts to reduce sg a as we work towards achieving a 2020 target of lowering sg a as a percentage of sales to 12 or better finally on april 9 2019 we completed the purchase of land in bangladesh which is intended to be used to expand our global textile and sewing operations our plans consist of the development of a large multi plant manufacturing complex which is currently expected to include two large textile facilities and related sewing operations once fully operational this complex is expected to provide capacity to service over 500 million in sales over the next twenty four months the company plans to construct and develop the first textile facility at the complex initial production at the facility is expected to start in the latter part of 2021 the company believes the build out of a large scale manufacturing hub in south east asia will significantly enhance its positioning to service international markets and support other key sales growth drivers operating results during the first quarter we generated sales of 623 9 million down 3 6 compared to the prior year quarter reflecting declines of 4 1 in activewear and 1 8 in the hosiery and underwear category as expected the decline in activewear where we generated 493 6 million in sales for the quarter was primarily due to lower levels of distributor restocking of imprintables compared to the level of restocking that occurred in the first quarter last year in advance of the price increase implemented in march 2018 these factors were partly offset by double digit growth in fleece shipments which drove more favourable product mix and the impact of higher net selling prices the slight sales decline in the hosiery and underwear category where we saw 130 4 million in overall sales was mainly attributable to lower gildan branded socks and underwear sales in the mass retail channel which was largely offset by higher socks sales of licensed and global lifestyle brands compared to last year as well as the benefit of earlier than anticipated shipments of a new private label men s underwear program in the mass channel for which initial shipments began towards the end of the first quarter gross margin in the first quarter of 2019 of 25 8 was down 140 basis points over the same period last year the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year quarter which was expected was primarily due to higher raw material and other input costs including inflationary pressures and unfavourable foreign exchange partly offset by the benefit of higher net selling prices and more favourable product mix sg a expenses for the first quarter of 2019 of 93 0 million were at the same level as in the prior year quarter as a percentage of sales sg a expenses were 14 9 or 60 basis points higher than the prior year quarter primarily reflecting the lower level of sales in the quarter compared to last year during the first quarter of 2019 the company recorded an impairment of trade accounts receivable of 24 4 million of which 21 7 million related to the wind down of operations of heritage sportswear which is under receivership as announced on march 26 2019 and 2 5 million related to the bankruptcy of payless shoesource consequently operating income of 32 7 million and adjusted operating income1 of 43 3 million were down 43 6 million and 39 4 million respectively compared to the same period last year reflecting the lower sales base inflationary cost pressures on gross profit and the trade receivable impairment charge net earnings for the three months ended march 31 2019 amounted to 22 7 million or 0 11 per share on a diluted basis compared with net earnings of 67 9 million or 0 31 per share on a diluted basis for the same period last year excluding the impact of after tax restructuring and acquisition related costs in both years gildan reported adjusted net earnings1 of 32 8 million or 0 16 per share on a diluted basis down from 74 6 million or 0 34 per share on a diluted basis in the first quarter of 2018 mainly due to the decline in operating income and higher net financial expenses the earnings decline on a per share basis was partly offset by the benefit of a lower share count compared to the prior year the company consumed 127 8 million of free cash flow1 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 40 0 million of free cash flow consumed in the first quarter last year mainly as a result of lower earnings in the quarter as anticipated and higher working capital requirements including planned inventory build during the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures totaling 22 8 million related primarily to investments in textile capacity expansion including the ramp up of our new rio nance 6 facility and related sewing expansion as well as investments in information technology during the first quarter of 2019 the company repurchased 876 459 common shares at a total cost of approximately 31 0 million pursuant to its normal course issuer bid ncib programs the company ended the first quarter of 2019 with net debt1 of 891 5 million and a net debt leverage ratio1 of 1 6 times net debt to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda1 in line with the company s target leverage outlook the company is now projecting 2019 gaap diluted eps of 1 75 to 1 85 and adjusted diluted eps of 1 90 to 2 00 on projected sales growth in the mid single digit range sales and adjusted diluted eps guidance is unchanged since the company s update on march 26 2019 the gaap eps range compares to our previous guidance of 1 80 to 1 90 which reflected previously projected restructuring and acquisition related costs of approximately 20 million after refining and incorporating estimates related to further manufacturing integration including the consolidation of canadian sheer hosiery manufacturing within the company s global supply chain and additional sales and marketing initiatives to drive further operational efficiencies across the organization the company is now projecting restructuring and acquisition related costs to be in the range of 30 million with the completion of the land acquisition in bangladesh for approximately 45 million in cash the company has updated its capital expenditure projection to be approximately 175 million compared to its previous guidance of 125 million consequently free cash flow generation for 2019 is now expected to be in the range of 300 to 350 million compared to 350 to 400 million previously adjusted ebitda is now projected to be in excess of 605 million after reflecting the trade receivable charge in the quarter compared to in excess of 630 million previously declaration of quarterly dividend the board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 0 134 per share payable on june 10 2019 to shareholders of record on may 16 2019 this

u s gdp accelerates while socialists triumph in spain will gold also win the us economic growth in the q1 2019 positively surprised indeed on the upside the doubting thomasses were proven wrong and the socialist party just won the snap elections in spain is the left back in vogue in the eurozone but what does it all mean for the gold market us gdp surprises on the upside on friday the government said that the us gdp expanded at a 3 2 percent annual pace in the first three months of 2019 what is important is that the number significantly surpassed the forecasts for example the economists polled by marketwatch had expected a 2 3 percent increase the fears of the slowdown were overblown as we have been warning for a long time actually the american economy accelerated in the first three months of 2019 as the economy grew at a 2 2 percent in q4 2018 as one can see in the chart below chart 1 us real gdp growth from q1 2014 to q1 2019 we acknowledge that some transitory factors such as inventories or government spending supported the gdp in q1 2019 so we could see some reversal in the future but the report was nevertheless decent what does it mean for the gold market well stronger us economy than previously expected is not good news for the yellow market the solid report could ease the fears about the recession and encourage more risk taking at the expense of safe havens such as gold moreover although the report does not have to change significantly the fed s stance it should end the chatter about the interest rate cut more hawkish expectations of the future path of the interest rates should be negative for the gold prices last but not least the strong economy is a good sign for president donald trump in the 2020 presidential elections a lot can of course change until next year but if the us economy stays on the solid track it will be difficult to beat trump it s still very early to conclude but gold would probably prefer a change of guard rather than the status quo socialists win spain the socialists won parliamentary elections in spain they won 123 seats up from 85 in 2016 this means that the left is not dead in europe if somebody doubted it however the party needs 176 mandates for majority so it needs to form a collation to govern the far left podemos has only 43 seats so the socialists will have to either make an alliance with the right or with the smaller regional parties like the basque nationalist or esquerra republicana the catalan separatist group another important change is that the right wing and populist vox entered the parliament for the first time it means that right wing populism arrived to spain however the party does not want to pull the country out of the eu or to abandon the euro spanish citizens are very enthusiastic about the common bloc we could see more populism in the upcoming elections to the european parliament the biggest loser of the election is the conservative people s party which lost about half its seats and will have just 66 deputies in the new parliament the spanish voters turned out to not be very grateful given the fact that the pp enacted crucial reforms in a response to the economic crisis that extracted the country from the disarray now the spanish economy is growing faster than the eurozone s average but reforms are not very popular and cannot compete with the social spending pedro sánchez the leader of the socialist party who headed the minority government for 10 months but was ultimately forced to call a snap election increased the minimum wage and pensions and he promised even more of social expenditures financed by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy however the bond markets reacted positively to the results the spread between yields on german and spanish 10 year debt narrowed by three basis points yesterday this is probably because sanchez is committed to spend within the fiscal limits set by the european union in 2018 spain s fiscal deficit declined to 2 5 percent and the socialists have pledged to keep whittling it down another issue is that the markets may hope that sanchez will form the first stable government in a few years the results of the spanish elections can thus support the euro against the us dollar gold would benefit then as well however the results were generally expected so the short term impact on the gold market should be minimal if any thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the link between the u s economy and the gold market we invite you to read the august market overview

webcast slides and now i will turn the call over to mr mizel for his opening remarks larry a mizel chairman and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement good afternoon and thank you for joining us today as we go over our results for the first quarter of 2019 and provide an update on our business mdc reported another strong quarter of profitability to start the year generating net income of 40 6 million or 0 64 per share home sale revenues grew 7 year over year on similar increase in new home deliveries even though the number of homes in our backlog to start the quarter was down by 7 homebuilding gross margin expanded 70 basis points over the prior year and net new orders increased 3 with a healthy absorption pace of 3 75 homes per community per month we believe that these results provide further validation of our shift to a more affordable product and our adherence to a build to order business model in general the new home market improved in the first quarter of 2019 following a period of more modest demand to the end of 2018 part of this improvement can be attributed to the normal seasonality associated with our business another contributing factor was the decline in mortgage rates which eased affordability concerns in some high cost markets lower rates combined with lower price points associated with our more affordable home collections resulted in a compelling value proposition for many of our buyers advertisement advertisement this provided a welcome tailwind for our sales effort complementing the continuing positive impact of other important economic factors such as low unemployment and strong consumer confidence sales activity in the quarter was consistent across our three segments with each posting average absorption rates exceeding 3 5 net orders per community per month our east segment produced the best order result in the term above absorption pace and year over year growth this was driven by particularly strong results in our florida markets and healthy demand for our more affordable product in this segment additionally orders in each of our segments got a boost from an increased average activity count in the quarter we believe that increased community count should continue to drive growth opportunities for the remainder of the spring as we ended the quarter with active communities 15 higher than a year ago the order activity we generated in the quarter came without excessive use of incentives as evidenced by a gross profit margin in our backlog to end the quarter that is only slightly lower than the 18 9 gross margins we realize on closings during the quarter advertisement advertisement the consistency of these margins can be attributed to our build order business model which lessens the need to use incentives when demand softens it also allows us to capture additional higher margin revenue through options and upgrades at our home galleries we believe that focusing our invested capital unsold homes rather than on specs is more risk adverse way of doing business and produces better more consistent returns over the long run in summary i m very pleased with the results this quarter we produce year over year growth and revenues pre tax income and orders despite an uncertain demand environment at the beginning of the year we expanded our homebuilding gross margins and grew community counts by 15 we continue to sell homes at a healthy rate thanks to our increased focus on more affordable product our emphasis on design and customization and our commitment to excellent customer service with a strong growth profile a healthy balance sheet and the highest dividend pay out in the industry we believe mdc is well positioned for the future advertisement advertisement now i d like to turn the call over to bob who will provide more detail on the results from the quarter robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer thanks larry and good afternoon everyone our consolidated pre tax income for the first quarter increased by 10 year over year to 55 6 million homebuilding pre tax income for the 2019 first quarter was up only slightly year over year to 41 1 million as an increase in gross profit was mostly offset by higher selling general and administrative costs however financial services pre tax income increased by 44 year over year to 14 6 million advertisement advertisement the increase was due mostly to a 4 8 million gain on marketable equity securities for the quarter compared to a 1 2 million loss on marketable equity securities for the first quarter of 2018 net income for the 2019 first quarter improved by 5 to 40 6 million or 0 64 per diluted share our tax rate increased from 23 3 for the 2018 first quarter to 27 1 for the 2019 first quarter the year over year increase was mostly attributable to energy tax credits which provided a benefit to us last year but not this year the 27 1 rate was above the estimated 24 to 26 range we had provided during our last earnings cycle primarily due to additional tax expense on stock options that were exercised during the quarter our home sale revenues for the 2019 first quarter were up 7 year over year to 647 3 million due entirely to a 7 increase in the number of homes delivered our backlog conversion rate was 46 which was above the expected range for q1 that we discussed in our previous call and higher than the 40 achieved a year ago advertisement advertisement the improvement in backlog conversion was aided by better cycle times which were achieved in part due to a higher mix of affordable product for the first quarter of 2019 52 of our closings came from product lines we characterize as our more affordable offerings as compared with 35 a year ago in our mountain segment cycle times also improved as a result of the vendor related product defect issue in colorado that negatively impacted cycle times for those homes delivered in the first half of 2018 on the other hand cycle times in our west segment were negatively impacted by our arizona markets due to labor constraints driven by strong new home demand backlog conversion for the quarter was also helped by a significant year over year increase in the number of spec homes we sold and closed during the quarter looking forward to the second quarter we are targeting a backlog conversion rate in the 41 to 43 range compared to the 40 backlog conversion rate we achieved in the second quarter of 2018 note that our average selling price of 476 600 for the 2019 first quarter was virtually unchanged from the same quarter a year ago it should also be noted that the average selling price for closed homes in the 2019 second quarter of almost 496 000 was the highest in our company s history and was impacted by a greater proportion of our closings coming from some of our highest price communities in southern california advertisement advertisement and so for the 2019 second quarter we expect a year over year decrease in average selling price somewhere in the mid single digits our gross margin from home sales was up 70 basis points year over year to 18 9 this increase was driven primarily by our west segment while our mountain segment experienced a small year over year decrease in their gross margin from home sales they continue to have the highest absolute level overall both florida and the mid atlantic experienced increases in gross margin from home sales but a shift in mix between those two areas resulted in the small year over year decrease in our east segment our gross margin and backlog to end the quarter remained healthy at a level just slightly below the 2019 first quarter gross margin of 18 9 however it should be noted that the gross margin level we actually realized in future periods could be impacted by cost increases cancellations price or incentive changes impairments reserve adjustments and other factors our total dollar sg a expense for the 2019 first quarter was up 11 million from the 2018 first quarter the increase is mostly due to a 6 9 million increase in general and administrative expense to 42 6 million driven by higher average headcount and a 3 million of additional stock based compensation expense from performance based stock option awards that were granted in 2016 and 2017 we currently expect second quarter general and administrative expense to be similar to the 42 6 million incurred in the first quarter based on the information we have today unexpected charges related to accruals or other items could cause the actual results to differ from this estimate additionally our marketing expenses increased by 2 7 million over the prior year caused by additional costs incurred to open and staff our 15 year over year increase in active subdivision count of the 18 3 million of expense incurred in the first quarter about 4 million was variable with closings the remaining 14 3 million should be relatively constant in the second quarter though it is subject to some variability based on the timing of expenses related to new community openings finally our commission expense for the quarter increased by 1 4 million over the prior year but this was entirely related to the increase we saw in home sale revenues the dollar value of our net orders decreased 1 year over year to 851 4 million driven by a 4 decrease in our average selling price that was largely offset by a 3 increase in unit net orders the demand for our more affordable product lines remains strong during the first quarter of 2019 accounting for 60 of net new orders compared to 44 a year ago this increase was largely attributable for the continued success of our seasons collection which accounted for 36 of our net new orders in the 2019 first quarter the increased prominence of our more affordable product lines across most of our markets contributed to the year over year decrease in the average price of our net orders additionally we saw a shift in the mix of our net orders to florida which is the state in our operations with the lowest average selling price our monthly absorption rate was a healthy 3 75 for the quarter though it was down 11 percent from the same quarter a year ago however this decrease was more than offset by a 15 increase in our average active subdivision count we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of 1 65 billion which was down 12 year over year the decrease was driven by a lower number of homes in backlog as well as a decrease in the average selling price of those homes active subdivision count was at 178 at the end of the 2019 first quarter up 15 from 155 a year ago we saw an increased number of active subdivisions across each segment with the west experiencing the largest increase oregon our newest market finished the quarter with two active communities compared with none a year ago looking at the graph on the right the number of soon to be active communities exceeded the number of soon to be inactive for the third consecutive quarter with 10 more communities soon to be active versus soon to be inactive at march 31st this favorable dynamic gives us confidence that we can continue to drive year over year growth in our subdivision count based on the progress we have already made we are on track to have another year of community count growth of 10 or greater for the 2019 first quarter we acquired 1 417 lots for roughly 90 million with an additional 77 million to spend on development costs approximately 60 of the lofts acquired in the first quarter were finished lots and about 60 were lots intended for our more affordable homes 2019 first quarter land acquisition spend was notably less than both the 2018 fourth quarter and the 2018 first quarter as we exercise some caution after seeing slower home sales activity late in 2018 however we expect to see an increase in activity from the first to the second quarter of 2019 given the solid level of sales activity we saw to start the spring selling season even with the relative low in acquisition activity at the end of that quarter we controlled 22 887 lots up 7 year over year about 28 of those lots were controlled with an option net homebuilding debt to capital was only 23 3 at the end of the first quarter flat from a year ago and clearly demonstrating our firm commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet furthermore our liquidity to end the 2019 first quarter was up 27 year over year to 1 49 billion providing us with significant resources to fund continued growth with that i will now turn the call back to the operator for a question and answer session questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question will be from john lovallo with bank of america please go ahead john lovallo bank of america analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions the first one bob i think you mentioned that the g a component of sg a was up about 70 bps year over year and stock comp i believe was up about 3 million i think that s something like 40 bps and then you mentioned headcount the first question is does the lease expense get captured in there as well and i think you mentioned that this portion of sg a should remain fairly stable in 2q is that correct robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer that s right it was 7 million increase year over year and what you mentioned is correct with regard to the lease expense yes that does continue to go through to this point we re finding it s fairly consistent even with the accounting change that we had this quarter so that really doesn t provide much of a difference year over year versus the old accounting and yes the 42 6 million of g a expense incurred in the first quarter i think is a reasonable run rate to use in the second quarter as we move forward here based upon what we know now john lovallo bank of america analyst okay and then i guess moving on to the oregon market it took an impairment last quarter just kind of getting things ramped up there just any update on that market and how you guys are feeling about the operations there robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes after recognizing that impairment i think we ve seen some really good things we ve opened up a few more communities that we have two active but we have others behind that in fact when you look at that soon to be active versus soon to be inactive dynamic i think we have two more soon to be active than inactive so we see that active community count growing in oregon so we re starting to get our feet under us and some real operations there and so we feel positive about what we re doing in that market john lovallo bank of america analyst okay thanks guys robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer thank you operator the next question will be from nishu sood with deutsche bank timothy daley deutsche bank analyst hi thanks this is actually tim daley on for nishu so my first question is regarding gross margin so gross margins came in line with the gross margin and backlog at the end of the quarter that you guided to so just curious as to what kind of what was the gross margin profile on the specs that were delivered in the quarter versus the build order closings and just kind of on a comment that i think you mentioned that build order closings tend to have a bit of a tailwind in margin due to option and upgrade premiums so just curious as to kind of the differential between the spec margins that were delivered in the quarter and build order if you could kind of maybe quantify some numbers around that for us robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes i think the differential was about 300 basis points in dirt versus spec with spec being lower of course that was also true in q4 if you go back to q3 they were roughly even the dirt margins versus spec margins so that is kind of a q4 and q1 phenomenon thus far and i think we have really seen that of course as a result of the decrease in orders we saw in q4 and more competition with that spec inventory timothy daley deutsche bank analyst all right understood and then i guess just kind of following onto that with the second question is the finished specs this quarter were only up 3 year over year after being up substantially more on a year over year basis than the year last in 2018 so just curious as to is there kind of maybe some potential upside to that gross margin and backlog given that just from the inventory that you guys have on the ground there might be i guess less closings from spec in the next quarter relative to what we saw this quarter robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer it s possible but then again we don t have those additional specs available for deliveries so there would kind of be an offset on revenue but you re right 27 of our orders in q1 came from specs and a year ago that number was more like 20 so we definitely saw kind of a bump in our activity due in our closings due to those specs that we re able to sell and close during the quarter timothy daley deutsche bank analyst all right understood thanks for the time robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer sure thanks operator the next question will be from michael rehaut with jpmorgan please go ahead michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question first bob i was hoping to circle back to guidance that you gave i belief back at your analyst day in november and you know obviously with the turbulence that the whole industry had in the second half of the year you know i believe on the last call you kind of backed off that guidance as most builders did but i was hoping if you could just provide any updated thoughts or comments around to the extent that you want to revisit that guidance if it s too early or not i m not sure some builders have provided some full year thoughts some haven t but you know if you recall that guidance for 2019 with closings growth of 5 to 13 gross margins of 19 or higher sg a of 11 or lower and asp is down mid single digit so i know it s kind of a lot of different metrics there but you know just any comments around you know revisiting that guidance directionally you know would be helpful robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes there s not a whole lot for the full year you know i did comment that we think we re pretty well positioned to hit a 10 plus increase in active subdivision count for the full year just because of what we ve seen already in the subdivision growth and what we see in the soon to be active versus soon to be inactive so we ve got that i commented on asp we re flat in q1 but q2 is likely to be down by that mid single digits nothing further from there obviously the gross margin with still the backlog gross profit margin relatively close to where our closings were that 18 9 i think that s encouraging on the margin front but i think we still want to see what happens for the remainder of the sales season before we do too much more there michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay fair enough i understand i guess secondly maybe just to drill down a little bit around the gross margins and more around incentive themselves as being a key driver the guidance or not guidance but the comment around gross margins and backlog being at or slightly less than in the first quarter obviously if you guys are doing much more on the build to order versus spec you re not going to be as influenced by shorter term volatility and incentives related to spec as larry i believe you pointed out but at the same time you know some other builders have pointed to a little bit of expected improvement sequentially in gross margin whereas you re looking for a slight decline sequentially so i was just trying to get a sense if that decline expected slight decline to the extent that the backlog gross margin plays out next quarter that s more driven by mix and or if there were indeed you know a little bit of higher incentives or you know if i don t know if there was some cost inflation or higher land cost basis just trying to get a sense of the different drivers of gross margin going forward particularly in the second quarter that might explain a slightly lower number versus again other builders that are expecting improvement at least over the next quarter or if not for the rest of the year robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer right and i know some of those other builders have higher spec counts to begin with so i guess that would be based on the presumption that they are able to decrease the incentives and maintain the volume which of course has yet to play out for the full spring selling season that said you know keep in mind for our q1 that comment about 27 of our closings coming from specs versus being closer to 20 in q4 and 20 percent a year ago we had a 16 of our closings in q1 where both sold and closed during the quarter so with that higher number of specs in that lower margin that 300 basis point margin differential a year ago that was only about 9 and now we ve settled down to a lower number of specs so you know i would expect that you don t get quite as much of an influence from specs in q2 so that could be a positive thing but that said i still think we need to take a look and see how demand plays out in q2 before any of the builders get really excited about it and that s the best thing that we have to go off of this is what s in our backlog right now michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst just lastly around that and i ll hop off some people have focused on lumber as a positive driver to gross margins over the next quarter or two is that a factor that to the extent that is a factor or a positive factor tailwind in your gross margins and backlog are there any other offsetting factors such as mix that could be the reason that we re not seeing any type of improvement as it is right now in terms of your backlog gross margin robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes there is we certainly have that element too on homes that we ve started in 2019 we ve gotten a bump from lumber costs being lower we do have a mix toward florida and arizona those tend to be a little bit lower in the gross profit margin spectrum as far as we go so there is a little bit of mix on that front but that s factored into what our backlog gross profit margin is to i should add michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst great thank you robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer sure thanks operator the next question will be from stephen kim with evercore please go ahead stephen kim evercore analyst yes thanks very much guys yes first question i guess relates to the land spend which you recorded in the quarter you mentioned that it was depressed but that you were looking to pick it back up i wanted to get a sense for if you could give some range around what kind of land spend we should expect do you think by the end of the year your land spend relative to let s say your revenues would be comparable to what you saw last year or is there a dollar value that we might think you might hit by the end of the year something like that robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer without putting out a specific number i think you could approach around where it was last year there s a couple of reasons behind that first of all we re higher on the development spend right now and that will continue for much of this year just based upon land acquisition we already did in 2018 you know the land acquisition piece of it certainly that s dependent upon what we see for demand for the remainder of the spring selling season and into the second half of the year but based upon what we ve seen in q1 we see that going up from where we were in q1 of 2019 and keep in mind that q1 of 2019 it was probably the lowest level we ve seen in about two years there was a little bit of a pullback for sure but a little bit of that was a wait and see until we got a taste of the spring selling season stephen kim evercore analyst got it so something you know a little bit north of a billion dollars on total land spend wouldn t be out of the realm of what you re thinking right robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer in terms of total land spend no that s not outside the realm stephen kim evercore analyst right okay and then you mentioned that you had sort of deliberately held off on some of your land spend activity due to the softness in the market at the end of last year which obviously makes a lot of sense i was just curious as to the mechanics around how that decision making happened for instance i was curious as to whether it was the case that land deals which had passed your feasibility analysis let s say earlier in the year they no longer penciled and that s why you didn t move on them because you lowered your expectations for the future outcomes within that on the project that you would build on that land or did they actually still pencil and you just decided not to act on those anyway basically which are the two would you say better characterizes the projects that you decided not to buy robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer there might have been a little bit of both i think with reduced absorption rates some of them were a little bit a little bit bigger than we wanted them to be we weren t wouldn t be able to absorp as quick as we originally thought just given what we saw in q4 if that had persisted kind of that 20 year over year decline in absorption rates that we saw in q4 so i think there were certainly some of that and then just some straight up caution as well just trying to make sure that we knew where the market was before we moved toward stephen kim evercore analyst got it and then as you look across that competitive landscape with respect to land acquisition would you say that because of the little scare that we had in the back half of land of last year that you re actually able to find a little bit more wiggle room on the part of land sellers or is it or has that really not been the case and you re just able to make the deals pencil because you re able to assume somewhat higher absorption levels than you were in fourth quarter something more akin to what you had in mind let s say mid year of last year robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer you know i think the land sellers see some of the same things that we ve seen and they re willing to be more flexible on terms especially to make it something that we can continue to move forward with i wouldn t go so far as to say it s outright decreases in land prices because i don t think we ve seen that commensurate decrease in home prices other than a little bit of extra incentivizing in q4 and q1 on especially on the speculative inventory so it s more on the terms than anything stephen kim evercore analyst got it great well thanks very much guys i appreciate it robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer okay operator the next question will be from stephen east with wells fargo please go ahead paul przybylski wells fargo analyst thank you this is paul przybylski on for stephen i guess first question goes back to the margin bob is there any way you could give us you know the margin profile on say your entry level communities are more affordable type stuff that you would open in the last quarter or so versus some of the more legacy stuff that has been around for maybe a year or more robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer you know it s i don t have that exactly like you put it i will say that the differential between the entry level has diminished kind of the spread between our traditional product and our affordable product simply because we ve rolled it out to more areas i d mentioned to michael earlier about the lower margin profile in phoenix and florida and that s where we ve gotten a lot of sales especially in florida so naturally it tends to trend a little bit lower a little bit closer to the traditional product and for a long time i ve warned a little bit that even though going back several quarters we ve seen as much of a as a 200 basis point differential between the affordable and other product that had some risk of coming in just because we see a lot of people who are doing the affordable product now all that said what we re doing is a little bit unique in that we have built to order affordable product which is something that is not common in our space paul przybylski wells fargo analyst okay and then do you have any comments on how april demand has been so far robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer april demand has been good i would expect april to be up year over year by as much as or more than the 3 we saw for q1 paul przybylski wells fargo analyst okay great and then do you have any color on california and the various geographies there and their performance and if it s moving in the right direction robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes i think they are more expensive the coastal areas have been tougher i think that s well documented with a lot of builders i think the more affordable is still doing well northern california for us is still doing well so really the biggest pieces is coastal higher price points paul przybylski wells fargo analyst okay thank you i appreciate it robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer sure thanks operator the next question comes from jay mccanless with wedbush securities please go ahead jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst hey thanks for taking my questions the first one i wanted to ask about is based on the numbers bob you gave earlier about the percentage of affordable homes and your closings and your orders it looks like orders in the non affordable stuff are down about 27 and closings were down about 21 assuming that i ve got my math right is that a function of just lower demand across the board or should we think about a reduction in traditional community count as impacting those numbers robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer i mean certainly most of our land acquisition efforts 60 of the lots acquired in q1 for example have gone toward that more affordable product so there definitely is a shift in mix you know i don t think necessarily a first time move up product we re looking to diminish that significantly some of the more expensive stuff i think certainly has been diminished the second time move up but the other thing to keep in mind is our affordable product it spans a lot of different things we ve talked about urban duplexes which is a two unit building we ve talked about seasons in colorado we built that without a basement but landmark as well that could meet the needs of a first time buyer or a move up buyer so there is a little bit of movement there but certainly we re looking to build upon our expertise kind of the move up product but a lot of our dollars right now are going toward the affordable product lines to make that happen jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then when we think about the acceleration from february to march in the order comp i m assuming that s about a 4 6 4 7 for march and did you see an improvement in demand in both in affordable as well as your more traditional second move up in luxury or was it all focused on the affordable product as you move from february to march robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer i don t know if i have it exactly like that it seemed like it was both our traditional and our affordable jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay and then one other quick question just in terms of co broker fees could you talk about how much all been paying on that and how it compares to last year s levels robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer you know we ve been pretty consistent in that of course we don t pay co broker on every deal but our percentage is pretty high i think it s about 72 and that s about the same as it was last year you know and typically it can vary by market but you know roughly 3 is a good rule of thumb jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay right thanks for taking my questions operator the next question will be from ivy zelman with zelman associates please go ahead ivy zelman zelman associates analyst good afternoon actually this question is for larry assuming larry you ll answer it but we d like to get your perspective on where i think it was bob or larry laughing but given what we re late in the economic cycle where are we in the housing cycle larry a mizel chairman and chief executive officer why are you picking on me ivy zelman zelman associates analyst never larry never larry a mizel chairman and chief executive officer i think i don t think we re late in the housing cycle i think that what we ve found is a sweet spot that many of the other builders are moving toward which is affordability and look as you see inflation becoming more deflationary as to numbers you see that affordability becomes even more interesting as we saw the fabulous gdp growth that was announced so you ve got strength but without inflation and you have disposable income kind of balancing out and i think ivy that the affordable housing market has good legs and a very fine outlook the products of higher price points in different parts of the country much higher than our average sales price are having more challenges so i m very optimistic on where we are and where we re going and i think other builders are picking it up the one thing that you continue to hear from us is we restrict our specs is the minimum that are created really out of fall out of the backlog and it s proven to be a good strategy and we allow people to personalize their home even in the affordable market we have a personalization package and not many other builders are willing to do that they re going after the high volume spec you get what we offer and we re going after the affordable and we allow you the opportunity to select what you really want ivy zelman zelman associates analyst so i absolutely agree with lot of what you said and i think one of the things that we re seeing some of the other builders do which is important just announced the tolls and the business certainly inaudible is getting into the rental business do you see an opportunity in single family that you can see expanding you know seasons in a rental product offering or selling seasons product to single family rental operators given to those people that have a difficulty affording a home and home ownership today larry a mizel chairman and chief executive officer we think it s the bad business to sell rentals in the markets in the subdivisions or the areas that we re in we certainly would not knowingly do it because when you drive down the street and the grass is green except for a few brown ones the way people take care of their homes if their rentals are slightly different that if they own it and i know that there is a demand for homes that are rented out that we do not intend to knowingly permitted ivy zelman zelman associates analyst got it well i appreciate your thoughts larry thank you very much good quarter larry a mizel chairman and chief executive officer thank you ivy operator the next question will be from alex barron with housing research center please go ahead alex barron housing research center analyst thank you i wanted to see if you could comment on roughly what percentage of your orders and deliveries are coming from seasons right now versus where they are a year ago and what s your ultimate target for that robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer i think on the orders it was 36 per seasons the year ago once it was right around 20 percent for closings it was 26 current quarter and i think 13 a year ago hold on one second i ll get you that comp number on the sales front yes so 19 percent that was off 5 19 in q1 of 2018 per seasons final results alex barron housing research center analyst and where do you see kind of your where are you guys targeting that to go was it like 50 or more or less than that robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer i think we want the affordable offering to be in the 60 plus range so i could certainly see the seasons moving a little bit higher you know maybe it s between 40 and 50 alex barron housing research center analyst so is it reasonable to expect the average sales price to keep trending a little bit lower in the next few quarters robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes alex barron housing research center analyst okay great well best of luck thank you robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer thank you operator our next question comes from buck horne with raymond james please go ahead buck horne raymond james analyst hey thanks good afternoon i wanted to ask a little bit on potential m a thoughts or activity around that one of your larger competitors made a move in las vegas recently to shore up some market share positions the southwest is obviously booming obviously you re having a lot of strength in florida as well how do you think about the need or the possibility of some sort of private builder acquisition or other land acquisition to shore up your market share in some of these growth areas larry a mizel chairman and chief executive officer we ve found over all these years we ve really only acquire assets not entities operating entities because of the contingent liabilities and the legacy problems and we find that we re able to execute our plan and have the growth we do through natural growth in an increasing market share in our existing markets we have gone into a few new markets over the last two or three years and it seems to be working out well but we don t see m a as in the sense that it s used today as something that we re pursuing buck horne raymond james analyst okay that s helpful and one last one just if you have it handy if you have the percentage of incentives or sales concessions that was used as a call it at a percentage of asp if you have it and just how did that trend throughout the quarter if you can characterize that robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer are you talking about closings buck horne raymond james analyst probably looking either closings or orders or both just trying to get a flavor for how you were you know how the level of discounting trended throughout the quarter robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer yes i think on orders i m sorry in closings we were at about 5 1 so that s up about 120 basis points year over year and 70 basis points sequentially buck horne raymond james analyst okay all right operator operator instructions the next question is a follow up from michael rehaut with jpmorgan please go ahead michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst thanks i just wanted to make sure i heard it right around your comments bob on april orders i believe you said that you would expect them to be up as much or more than 3qs 3 is that right robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer correct michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst and so you know if i m to extrapolate that you know particularly from a community count standpoint you know still should be probably up around you know that you know roughly 10 if you kind of work off of your current number and hold pace on the 10 expect that are better growth by the end of the year it would still point to some year over year you know decent year over year decline 5 10 let s say on sales pace historically your sales pace sequentially was roughly flat from 2q to 1q you have the exception last year but it s typically it s been a little bit flat so just want to make sure if i m thinking about that right from a sales pace perspective that you know you re still perhaps not fully back to normalized trends or if there s anything else going on there robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer that was a lot of math and a lot of extrapolating i m not sure i would extrapolate it out to the full quarter at this point i think it s positive that we continue to have year over year improvement in orders i mean obviously the day is not done for today still in april so we don t have the final count there yet so i don t want you to read too much into that number right now i just wanted to give you directionally just a little bit of a flavor that things are still going pretty good michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst okay i appreciate that and then you also said incentives were again just making sure i heard it right 5 1 of closings up 120 bps year over year and 70 bps sequentially robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer 5 1 of gross revenue for closings yeah michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst gross revenue robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer comparison michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst 5 1 of closings revenue is that okay robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer right michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst right okay perfect thank you robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer gross revenue for the incentives incentives or reduction to revenue michael rehaut jpmorgan analyst right great thank you robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer sure thanks operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to bob martin for any closing remarks robert n martin senior vice president chief financial officer and principal accounting officer thank you very much for joining us this

our excess capital will be deployed into afg s core businesses as we identify potential for healthy profitable organic growth and opportunities to expand our specialty niche businesses through acquisitions and start ups that meet our target return thresholds in addition returning capital to shareholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and opportunistic share repurchases are also an important and effective component of our capital management strategy the 1 50 per share special cash dividend announced today approximately 135 million reflects afg s strong financial position and our confidence in the company s financial future we continue to expect core net operating earnings in 2019 to be between 8 35 and 8 85 per share our core earnings per share guidance excludes non core items such as realized gains and losses as well as other significant items that are not able to be estimated with reasonable precision or that may not be indicative of ongoing operations specialty property and casualty insurance operations core operating earnings in afg s p c insurance operations were 185 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 188 million in the prior year period the specialty p c insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of 88 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to 92 million in the first quarter of 2018 a decrease of 4 higher underwriting profitability in our property and transportation group was more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our specialty casualty and specialty financial groups the first quarter 2019 combined ratio of 92 5 increased 0 8 from the prior year period first quarter 2019 results include 4 0 points of favorable prior year reserve development compared to 5 1 points of favorable development in the comparable prior year period catastrophe losses were 1 1 points of the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2019 by comparison catastrophe losses added 1 2 points in the prior year period gross and net written premiums were up 5 and 4 respectively in the 2019 first quarter compared to the same quarter a year earlier primarily the result of growth within our property and transportation and specialty casualty groups average renewal pricing across our entire p c group was up approximately 1 for the quarter excluding our workers compensation business renewal pricing was up slightly more than 4 an improvement from renewal rate increases achieved in 2018 further details about afg s specialty p c operations may be found in the accompanying schedules the property and transportation group reported an underwriting profit of 39 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 33 million in the first quarter of 2018 higher underwriting profit in our transportation businesses was partially offset by lower underwriting profit in our agricultural property inland marine and ocean marine businesses as well as our singapore branch catastrophe losses in this group were 9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 5 million in the comparable 2018 period first quarter 2019 gross and net written premiums in this group were 3 and 6 higher respectively than the comparable prior year period the growth in gross written premiums is primarily attributable to new business opportunities in our transportation businesses overall renewal rates in this group increased 4 in the first quarter of 2019 an improvement from renewal rate increases achieved in 2018 the specialty casualty group reported an underwriting profit of 36 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 41 million in the comparable 2018 period higher profitability in our targeted markets businesses was more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our excess surplus lines and workers compensation businesses despite lower year over year profit in our workers compensation operations these businesses achieved excellent underwriting margins catastrophe losses for this group were 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 5 million in the comparable 2018 period gross and net written premiums for the first quarter of 2019 were up 7 and 5 respectively compared to the same period in 2018 higher year over year gross written premiums within neon resulting from the growth of its portfolio in targeted classes of business the addition of premiums from aba insurance services as well as improved pricing and higher retentions in our excess and surplus lines businesses were the primary drivers of the higher premiums lower premiums in our workers compensation businesses partially offset this growth a change in neon s reinsurance program resulted in proportionally higher cessions of neon s premiums during the 2019 first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2018 renewal pricing for this group was down 1 during the first quarter excluding rate decreases in our workers compensation businesses renewal rates in this group were up 5 an improvement from renewal rate increases achieved in 2018 the specialty financial group reported an underwriting profit of 13 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 15 million in the comparable 2018 period the decrease was driven primarily by lower underwriting profitability in our financial institutions business catastrophe losses for this group were 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a 3 million in the prior year quarter first quarter 2019 gross written premiums were up 3 and net written premiums were down 2 when compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of higher premiums in our fidelity and crime business which were offset by lower premiums in our surety and lending and leasing businesses renewal pricing in this group was up approximately 3 for the quarter carl lindner iii stated our specialty p c group performed very well during the first quarter with strong underwriting margins healthy year over year growth in net written premiums and renewal pricing that is exceeding our objectives based on results during the first quarter we continue to expect an overall 2019 calendar year combined ratio in the range of 92 to 94 and net written premiums to be flat to up 3 when compared to the 5 billion reported in 2018 further details about afg s specialty p c operations may be found in the accompanying schedules and in our quarterly investor supplement which is posted on

value accounting for fias were a quarterly record of 134 million in the first quarter of 2019 driven by growth in the business and the favorable impact of a very strong stock market partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher crediting rates and option costs impact of fair value accounting for fias under gaap a portion of the reserves for fias 3 2 billion and 2 5 billion at march 31 2019 and 2018 respectively is considered an embedded derivative and is recorded at fair value based on the estimated present value of certain expected future cash flows assumptions used in calculating this fair value amount include projected interest rates option costs surrenders withdrawals and mortality variances from these assumptions as well as changes in the stock market will generally result in a change in fair value items such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the stock market are not economic in nature for the current reporting period but rather impact the timing of reported results the impact of fair value accounting for fias includes an ongoing expense for annuity interest accreted on the fia embedded derivative reserve the amount of interest accreted in any period is generally based on the size of the embedded derivative and current interest rates we expect both the size of the embedded derivative and interest rates to rise resulting in continued increases in interest on the embedded derivative liability in the first quarter of 2019 corporate a2 rates decreased by approximately 49 basis points compared to the year end market expectation as indicated by the forward curve that they would increase this difference contributed to a significant unfavorable fair value accounting impact of 45 million 0 39 per share by comparison a 13 increase in the s p 500 index contributed to a favorable fair value accounting impact of 15 million 0 13 per share for the first quarter of 2019 as shown in the table above the majority of the impact of these two items is non economic and is expected to reverse over time by comparison in the first quarter of 2018 the benefit of significantly higher than expected interest rates was minimally offset by the impact of a decrease in the stock market for additional analysis of fair value accounting see our quarterly investor supplement which is posted on afg s website annuity premiums afg s annuity segment reported statutory premiums of 1 40 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 1 15 billion in the first quarter of 2018 an increase of 22 this increase was driven by higher sales of traditional fixed annuities in the financial institutions channel however as a result of decreases in market interest rates over the last several months afg has implemented several rate decreases to its annuity products which are expected to slow sales craig lindner stated i am pleased to report record annuity earnings before the impact of fair value accounting for fias in the first quarter of 2019 providing a strong start for the annuity segment although we are pleased that premiums have grown by 22 year over year interest rates have declined recently which we expect will temper new sales as we remain committed to achieving appropriate returns on new business 2019 annuity outlook due to the strong stock market performance to date in 2019 afg is raising its guidance for full year pretax annuity earnings before fair value accounting by 10 million to a range of 445 million to 475 million in 2019 however due to the impact of decreases in market interest rates to date in 2019 afg expects that its pretax annuity earnings including the impact of fair value accounting will remain as previously forecasted in the range of 365 million to 425 million in 2019 this guidance assumes i interest rates and the stock market rise moderately for the remainder of 2019 ii more normalized income from certain investments required to be marked to market through earnings and iii a lower impact in 2019 from unusual investment income items such as prepayment of fixed income securities fluctuations in these items could lead to significant positive or negative impacts on the annuity segment s results afg is modifying its previously announced 2019 annuity premium guidance based on annuity sales through the first four months of the year however recently implemented rate decreases on its annuity products and a focus on pricing discipline are expected to temper new sales as a result afg now expects its 2019 annuity sales to be flat to down slightly from its record 5 4 billion of premiums in 2018 more

published wednesday 1 may 2019 print disqus by richard rick mills ahead of the herd whoever has an army has power mao zedong in march italy broke ranks with its eu partners in joining china s belt and road initiative known also as one belt one road or the new silk road students of history know the original silk road refers to the ancient network of trading routes between china and europe which served as both a conduit for the movement of goods and an exchange of ideas for centuries the new silk road is the term for an ambitious trade corridor first proposed by the chinese regime under its current president xi jinping in 2013 the grand design also known confusingly as the belt and road initiative bri is a belt of overland corridors and a road of shipping lanes it consists of a vast network of railways pipelines highways and ports that would extend west through the mountainous former soviet republics and south to pakistan india and southeast asia so far over 60 countries containing two thirds of the world s population have either signed onto bri or say they intend to do so according to the center for foreign relations the chinese government has already spent about 200 billion on the growing list of mega projects projects including the 68 billion china pakistan economic corridor morgan stanley predicts china s expenditures on bri could climb as high as 1 3 trillion by 2027 the belt and road initiative is seen by proponents as an economic driver of proportions never seen before in human history it would not only allow asia to relieve its infrastructure bottleneck ie an 800 billion annual shortfall on infrastructure spending but bring less developed neighboring nations into the modern world by providing a growing market of 1 38 billion chinese consumers opponents argue that is naive and the real intent of bri is to carve new chinese spheres of influence in asia that will replace the united states in debt poor nations to china for decades and restore china to its former imperial glory this article leans heavily towards the latter interpretation of bri particularly its linkages between china s industrial and military build up it explains why belt and road is really a dangerous trojan horse hiding behind china s territorial ambitions that should be resisted especially by vulnerable countries that are risking long term debt servitude the new silk road the silk routes connected china india tibet the persian empire the mediterranean countries and parts of north and east africa the 7 000 mile silk road begins at the chinese city of x an formerly chang an when it reaches dunhuang the silk road splits into three routes the southern route central route and and northern route these trade routes spread throughout the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and extended as far as pakistan india and even rome the silk road routes were established during the han dynasty which opened trade to the west in 130 bc and they lasted until 1453 ad when the ottoman empire boycotted trade with china and closed them the han extended the great wall of china to protect the movement of chinese goods along the silk road the maritime silk road was a network of shipping lines from the red sea to east africa india china and southeast asia the network consisted of ship routes in two general directions the east china sea routes and the south china sea routes the east china sea routes connected the chinese mainland to the northeast asian regions of the liaodong peninsula the korean peninsula and the japanese islands the south china sea route heads down then up through the malacca straits into the bay of bengal opening up china to the coasts of the indian ocean the red sea the persian gulf and the african continent these shipping lanes are still in use as mentioned the belt part of the belt and road initiative introduced by president xi jinping in 2013 refers to a network of overland road and rail routes and oil natural gas pipelines planned to run along the major eurasian land bridges china mongolia russia china central and west asia china indochina peninsula china pakistan bangladesh china india myanmar they ll stretch from xi an in central china through central asia reaching as far as moscow rotterdam and venice the road is a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure projects from south and southeast asia to east africa and the northern mediterranean sea china is already the world s largest consumer of commodities why does it need to build a belt and road there are a few reasons the first as mentioned is to construct physical infrastructure such as railways roads and bridges that will help the region to meet its 800 billion annual infrastructure shortfall estimated by the asian development bank china would also build 50 special economic zones modeled after the shenzhen special economic zone first launched in 1980 under economic reformer president deng xiaoping less benevolently bri would allow china to expand the use of the chinese currency the yuan something we have written about as the global influence of the us dollar as the world s reserve currency wanes according to the centre for foreign relations bri is also a central tenet of xi jinping s pushback against obama s pivot to asia contain china by extending us ties to southeast asia and distancing himself from his predecessors who followed deng s philosophy bide your strength bide your time for xi the waiting is over the time for imperialist expansion is now political aspirations an asia geopolitical expert says that while the new silk road satisfies a number of economic goals for china including expanding its supply chains accessing overseas labor and preventing massive layoffs when companies run out of domestic infrastructure to build the over riding goal is regional influence richard javad heydarian author of asia s new battlefield the usa china and the struggle for the western pacific writes above all however it allows china to lock in precious mineral resources and transform nations across the eurasian land mass and indian ocean into long term debtors a leading credit rating agency recently warned that the obor is driven primarily by china s efforts to extend its global influence where genuine infrastructure needs and commercial logic might be secondary to political motivations the result is what one observer aptly described as debt trap diplomacy since some nations end up piling up unsustainable debts to china meanwhile larger nations such as india have raised concerns over china s geopolitical intensions since the project runs through the disputed kashmir region other countries from indonesia to the philippines and nigeria have raised concerns over the quality of chinese infrastructure investments their compliance with good governance and environmental regulations and beijing s tendency to employ not only chinese technology and engineers but also chinese labourers for overseas projects debt trap so far we have learned the 5ws of the belt and road initiative it s easy to see how the trillion dollar infrastructure network benefits china but what about the 60 odd nations who have said they want in what s in it for them the huge projects need to be paid for somehow china s idea is for chinese state owned firms to build the infrastructure paid for by participating countries those who can t afford it and that is most of them would be offered inexpensive loans and credit it s no different from banks offering rock bottom interest rates to homeowners whose incomes are below that needed to support a mortgage chinese state owned banks and china led international financial institutions like the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib would shoulder the debt burden china has set up an initial 40 billion silk road fund while the aiib is allocating an additional 50 billion but the loans come with huge risks in 2017 when sri lanka couldn t pay off its chinese creditors beijing took control of colombo a strategic port through a 99 year lease by the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of sri lanka s foreign debt was owed to china the money accepted for around 8 billion worth of ports and highways planned through bri some countries have scaled back or canceled bri projects due to the specter of unsustainable debt burdens states al jazeera hopefully italy is aware of the risks the southern european country is heavily in debt and went into recession last year it reportedly wants to re balance sino italian trade by exporting more to china it is the 13th eu member country that has signed an mou with china regarding bri but the first g7 nation to do so sparking condemnation from the united states which is engaged in a trade war with china and the eu which earlier this year branded china a systemic rival and wants to restrict chinese investment in europe al jazeera said military buildup is it a coincidence that the chinese president xi jingping is racing around trying to sign countries onto bri while at the same time posing for photos in full military uniform saluting chinese soldiers we don t think so tuesday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s liberation army pla and the chinese navy did not squander the opportunity to show its latest show of power a stealth destroyer according to a reuters story the combat ready 10 000 ton nanchang 101 is armed with 113 vertical launch sales able to fire hhq 0 surface to air missiles yj 18 anti cruise missiles and cj 10 land attack cruise missiles we have written extensively on the escalating tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei ongoing maneuvers demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china is increasing its military drills around japan with japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times within a year against chinese aircraft according to japan s annual military white paper there are also frequent tensions in the taiwan strait the body of water separating china and taiwan a us ally the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced reunification between china and taiwan would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us meanwhile china continues to expand its military a year ago it was reported that china planned to boost military spending by 8 1 in 2018 compared to a 7 increase in 2017 a reuters in depth report on how china is displacing america as the world s predominant military power in asia is required reading for anyone interested in how the geopolitical balance of power in the north pacific is shifting it details how xi jinping is overhauling the pla which includes the navy by pouring more resources into the navy and ridding the pla s ranks of corruption in just over two decades china has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the u s armory china s shipyards have spawned the world s biggest navy which now rules the waves in east asia beijing can now launch nuclear armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines giving it a powerful second strike capability and the pla is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the south china sea while stepping up preparations to recover taiwan by force if necessary for the first time since portuguese traders reached the chinese coast five centuries ago china has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast conflict between china and the united states in these waters would be destructive and bloody particularly a clash over taiwan according to serving and retired senior american officers and despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the cold war there would be no guarantee america would prevail the u s could lose said gary roughead co chair of a bipartisan review of the trump administration s defense strategy published in november we really are at a significant inflection point in history industry military connection we know that china is planning a huge infrastructure buildout in its trillion dollar bri involving some 60 odd countries and we know that beijing is at the same time bulking up its military what we don t know is if the two are related is china covertly funneling money from bri into its military in december 2018 the new york times reported on a secret proposal to expand a program by the pakistani air force by building chinese military jets weaponry and other hardware there would also be increased cooperation between china and pakistan in space where rocket propelled technology often overlaps with the military according to the article the military projects were designated as part of china s belt and road initiative in response to that claim cnbc quoted michael fuchs a senior fellow at the center for american progress and a former u s deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs from 2013 to 2016 that doesn t necessarily mean the chinese military will use the entire bri to its advantage but it will certainly tap into a number of projects he added bri infrastructure schemes in member countries such as pakistan sri lanka and djibouti are all about giving access to china s military he said a 2018 report by c4ads a us based research group sought to tease out whether china s portrayal of bri as strictly economic is true as explained by south china morning post the report looked at 15 chinese funded port projects in bangladesh sri lanka cambodia australia oman malaysia indonesia djibouti and elsewhere in the indo pacific region it found that the projects were not win win for china and the host countries as china claimed rather the investments appear to generate political influence stealthily expand china s military presence and create an advantageous strategic environment in the region the report stated resource raids of course none of this should come as a shock if we look at how china has repeatedly sought raw materials necessary to feed its resource ravenous economy we ve covered how china is locking up critical resources in the us s own backyard we also know that bri whatever china s motivations is going to require a hell of a lot more mined commodities it doesn t have an abundance of like copper zinc iron ore etc mining com reported in under 10 years the number of china headquartered mining companies with assets in africa went from just a handful in 2006 to 120 in 2015 two high profile examples are the acquisition by china general nuclear power corporation of the husab uranium project in namibia and zijin mining s involvement 39 6 in the massive kamoa kakula copper deposit in the drc while iron ore and copper have been the hot targets of overseas acquisitions by chinese firms the chinese have also gone after gold nickel tin and coking coal more recently the most desired metals are those that feed into the tectonic global shift from fossil fuels to the electrification of vehicles china molybdenum bought the tenke copper and cobalt mine in the democratic republic of congo for 2 65 billion in an effort to secure a supply of cobalt for ev batteries last summer china s ganfeng lithium paid chilean state lithium miner 87 5 million for sqm s 50 stake in the cauchari olaroz lithium project in argentina the purchase means china now effectively controls half of the world s lithium production necessary for lithium ion batteries conclusion china s ascent from an economic backwater to a 21st century superpower is nothing short of incredible within 30 years the country whose citizenry was oppressed impoverished and riding around on bicycles is now the world s biggest consumer of mined commodities influences real estate markets worldwide just look at vancouver and has obscenely rich people driving 100 000 luxury cars except for its horrible air quality china is now the envy of many poorer countries but that doesn t mean they should roll over and let china take advantage of its weaker brethren the belt and road initiative is not some modern day asian version of the marshall plan the united states had obvious economic motivations in giving 12 billion to help rebuild western europe but there was also the strategic imperative of helping europe to get back on its feet in order to contain a rising ussr no such threat exists with bri china has no reason to come to its neighbors aid with multi billion dollar infrastructure loans other than to gain economic and political influence over them sure there may be some programs where it s a win win but it appears the deck is way stacked against bri host nations where the outcome will almost certainly leave china the clear winner as uncle ben in spider man said with great power comes great responsibility that assumes that the one wielding the power

the ftse 100 lost ground yesterday on the back of disappointing manufacturing reports from china â when the chinese economy grew by more than expected in the first quarter there was a belief in some sections of the investment community that the country was beginning to turn a corner the manufacturing updates painted a picture of the economy standing still rather than lifting off given that the ftse100 is relatively overweight when it comes to mining stocks the major continental markets are closed today as it is may day and volatility in the uk market is tipped to be low the fed will release their interest decision at 7pm uk time and the press conference will follow at 7 30pm uk time last week it was reported that the us economy grew by 3 2 in the first quarter but a closer look at the report shows that inventories were relatively high and investment was soft earlier this week the core pce reading dropped to 1 6 its lowest level since january 2018 the fedâ inflation target is 2 and seeing as the cost of living in going in the opposite direction the central bank are likely to keep rates on hold and use neutral to dovish language in their update yesterday we saw mixed housing data from the us the case schiller update showed that annual house price grew at their slowest rate in seven years in february while pending home sales surged by 3 8 in march and that was a big improvement

start quantitative easing by buying bonds to lower interest rates powell did not respond directly to trump s suggestions but he says the fed went through a lengthy debate over two days of discussions before announcing its decision on wednesday to keep its policy rate unchanged we don t think about other factors outside of how the economy is doing powell says he says the panel felt that the fed s policies on interest rates were in a good place ___ 3 30 p m federal reserve chairman jerome powell acknowledges that the u s central bank has struggled to meet its target of 2 inflation powell tells reporters at a news conference that many central banks have fallen short of their inflation goals saying that this likely reflects demographic and global forces that are disinflationary still powell is confident that the underlying factors keeping u s inflation below 2 are transitory he said that clothing prices dropped because of changes in the methodology and that airfare prices have been low there are reasons to think those are transitory and will turn around he says ___ 3 14 p m stock and bond markets seesawed between gains and losses wednesday afternoon as investors weighed the federal reserve s assessment of the economy and the prospects for future interest rate moves both stocks and bonds rallied after the fed released its policy statement which noted that inflation remained unusually low as the economy continues to remain healthy the yield on the 2 year treasury note fell sharply to 2 21 from 2 26 that came as investors aggressively bought the notes anticipating that the fed would want to keep rates low however stocks and bonds reversed course and turned mixed after fed chairman jerome powell declined to say whether some investors are misguided in expecting the central bank to trim interest rates this year something traders have been betting will happen before year s end ___ 3 05 p m federal reserve chairman jerome powell avoided commenting on some controversial views voiced by president trump s pick for the fed s board of governors stephen moore powell was asked if recent strong wage gains among women workers which have outpaced men s wage increases posed a potential problem for the economy moore has written in the past that when women make more than men it can threaten family stability one of many provocative comments that have threatened his potential nomination on capitol hill i think men and women should make the same amount for the same work powell responded but when pressed he declined to go further it s not my role to engage on any nominee for the fed he added ___ 2 45 p m powell declined to say whether some investors are misguided in expecting the u s central bank to trim interest rates this year powell has effectively hit pause on any future rate hikes leading to speculation that the fed could choose to cut rates as insurance against an economic slowdown but powell ducked the question at a news conference the committee is comfortable with our current policy stance he said ___ 2 35 p m president donald trump s controversial choice for the federal reserve board of governors issued a statement supporting his own nomination within a minute of fed officials announcing that they would keep a key short term rate unchanged stephen moore the economics and politics commentator issued a statement through a public relations firm that noted support from jeremy siegel a finance professor at the university of pennsylvania who was interviewed on cnbc siegel says that moore would help solve the federal reserve s groupthink problem moore favors cutting rates a stance shared by trump but moore s statement also criticizes the possibility of trying to spend 2 trillion on infrastructure by raising taxes ___ 2 p m the federal reserve is leaving its key interest rate unchanged and signaling that no rate hikes are likely in coming months amid signs of renewed economic health but unusually low inflation the fed left its benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 the central bank s low rate policy has helped boost stock prices and supported a steadily growing economy whose outlook has brightened since late last year the fed did make a technical adjustment to trim the interest it pays banks on reserves to 2 35 percent as a way to keep its benchmark rate inside its approved range the decision wednesday to make no change in the policy rate policy had been expected despite renewed pressure from president donald trump for the fed to cut rates aggressively to help accelerate economic growth the fed statement had a more upbeat view of the economy saying that economic activity rose at a solid rate in march the fed said that it appeared growth had slowed from the fourth quarter ___ 12 15 p m stocks are edging higher on wall street and bond yields are lower ahead of the federal reserve s latest policy statement investors will be closely parsing the fed s announcement which is due out later wednesday afternoon particularly any references to how the fed thinks the economy is doing assurances from the fed late last year that any interest rate increases in 2019 were unlikely helped the stock market recover from a steep rout investors had worried that the fed could destabilize the economy if it continued raising borrowing costs the s p 500 and the dow jones industrial average were both up about 0 1 at midday bond prices rose after a report on the manufacturing sector came in weaker than analysts anticipated the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 2 48 ___ 4 45 a m stock markets are edging higher ahead of a federal reserve policy meeting at which the central bank is not expected to change its interest rates but could give clues on their future direction futures for the dow and the s p 500 are both up 0 4 the indexes that are open for trading in europe where much of the region is closed for a holiday are also up slightly with britain s ftse 100 up 0 1 the dollar was steady against the yen and euro fed chairman jerome powell will hold a news conference after the fed meeting ends wednesday economists expect the fed to say that it will not increase its key interest rates anytime soon as it monitors the health of the u s and global economy low rates tend to help stock markets and the economy by making it cheaper to borrow money president donald trump has called for what no mainstream economist is advocating interest rate cuts ___ 12 05 a m the federal reserve is all but sure to keep interest rates on hold wednesday and for the foreseeable future even as president donald trump keeps up his attacks on the fed for not cutting rates the fed will likely reiterate a message that has reassured consumers and investors since the start of the year no rate hikes are likely anytime soon the fed s low rate policy is keeping borrowing costs down helping boost stock prices and supporting an economy that s growing steadily and with inflation remaining tame the fed is seen as able to stay on the sidelines at least through this year yet trump insists the economy can do better and to that end he is demanding what almost no mainstream economist would favor cutting rates further
photo brendan smialowski afp getty images the trump administration is furiously spinning newly revealed proof of its corruption so you know it s infrastructure week again and this time around the president s quest to fix our nation s crumbling roads and bridges or look like he s trying actually has a bit of traction on tuesday donald trump had a bizarrely constructive meeting with the democratic congressional leadership wherein both sides agreed that the federal government should make a 2 trillion investment in america s infrastructure no details were sweated and over the ensuing 24 hours congressional republicans have blanched at the policy s price tag while some democrats have insisted that new spending must be paid for by rolling back trump s tax cuts on high earners nevertheless some observers might take heart at the mere existence of bipartisan negotiations over how to address a genuine policy challenge but they shouldn t the new round of infrastructure talks does not exemplify what s still working in washington rather it embodies three of the biggest problems in american politics today 1 the republican party is unwilling to prioritize appealing to voters over entrenching plutocracy earlier this week chuck schumer announced that he wouldn t even consider supporting a hike in the gas tax the traditional mechanism for funding highway improvements until republicans agreed to pare back some of the tax cuts they showered on the wealthy and corporations in 2017 having put their party s idea for how to finance an infrastructure package on the table democrats now insist that the president tell them whose taxes he would like to raise instead and trump almost certainly won t do that because his party will not let him propose taxes on the wealthy and his political acumen won t allow him to call for tax hikes on the middle class if both parties answered primarily to their own voters this would not be a sticking point before republicans passed the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 polls showed a majority of gop voters opposed lowering taxes on corporations or high earners and by all appearances the white house s internal research showed the same tax reform will protect low income and middle income households not the wealthy and well connected president trump assured supporters in a speech in indiana in september 2017 they can call me all they want it s not going to help i m doing the right thing and it s not good for me believe me national economic council director gary cohn went further promising the wealthy are not getting a tax cut under our plan three months later the white house celebrated the passage of a tax cut package that delivered the lion s share of its benefits to the top one percent raising taxes on the rich is popular with the typical republican voter and with the kinds of swing voters donald trump will need to win in the rust belt next year investing in infrastructure is too by offering to support a 2 trillion infrastructure package funded by progressive taxation democrats are effectively offering to do the republican president a huge political favor they are giving him a chance to pass hugely popular bipartisan legislation that would earn him effusive praise from the mainstream media and validate his populism and or status as an unconventional republican to former democrats in the midwest right before he runs for reelection if the gop were a political party devoted to maximizing its vote share without betraying its voting base it would see schumer s pay for demand as a wet kiss not a poison pill but the gop is not such a party its overriding priority is to concentrate economic power in the hands of its largest shareholders so it refuses to support popular legislation that would cost rich people money even when doing so would aid a majority of republican voters and increase the party s prospects for winning elections as a result the party must rely on obscuring the material implications of its agenda by stoking conservative social alienation and white racial paranoia which is the main reason why our republic can t have nice things 2 the democratic party is unwilling to govern strategically some of the democratic party s leaders are handling these negotiations competently if your goal is to project an image of reasonableness without actually helping trump score a legislative win that ll boost his reelection hopes then calling for a giant progressively financed infrastructure package makes good sense why not make trump a popular offer he can t accept but not everyone in the party is onboard a significant number of moderates in nancy pelosi s caucus appear to actually want to reach a compromise with their republican colleagues for these lawmakers scoring some pork for their home districts and demonstrating their bipartisan bona fides is well worth the risk of helping trump secure another four years in power as politico reports house transportation chairman peter defazio d ore insists that republicans can get the political cover they would need to support a funding plan if the president and democrats step outside together and announce they re supporting one after schumer called for a partial repeal of the 2017 gop tax cuts defazio tried to walk back that suggestion calling it a talking point for 2020 and not a realistic proposal in an interview with the daily beast a senior democratic aide spelled out the implications of defazio s realism more plainly tuesday s meeting was the latest evidence that democrats still haven t found agreement about what that balance looks like and that trump s looming reelection campaign is sparking strategic handwringing within a party that wants to defeat him but to pad their own résumé too asked for instance about the fear expressed from some democrats that a big bipartisan infrastructure package could considerably boost the president s re election chances a senior house democratic aide replied with exasperation you know what who gives a fuck the aide said who gives a fuck we ran on the issue of infrastructure so i don t know why it would be a surprise to anyone that if we can get a bill done we d be advocating for that we are not republicans we don t put politics ahead of getting something done for our constituents that s not what we do this reasoning reflects two of the democratic party s worst pathologies its refusal to think critically about the implications of the republican party s extremism and its members myopic refusal to put team blue s interests above their own who gives a fuck about whether passing a watered down regressively funded infrastructure plan would help a lawless openly racist president win reelection who gives a fuck about whether the price of winning a gold star from no labels is another six dozen 40 year old reactionaries appointed to the judiciary and an anti choice majority consolidated on the supreme court i would imagine some of the democratic party s constituents might deem these questions worthy of consideration because they are capable of recognizing that politics is war by other means not a rarified form of elite performance art this senior aide is ostensibly aware that america s state and federal governments are primarily controlled by a political party that puts politics ahead of getting something done for the public if the gop is such a pathological party then how could it not be in the interest of one s constituents to make disempowering the gop a top governing priority as is so often the case on the left side of the aisle the high minded rhetoric here is just camouflage for self interested myopia some swing district democrats have focus group data that suggest they can marginally increase the probability of reelection by helping trump pass an infrastructure bill so who fucking cares what implications that might have for dreamers or voting rights or the rule of law who fucking cares whether refusing to match the procedural radicalism of one s rivals gives them a structural advantage in political competition we came here to make friends not to win power a less virulent strain of this feckless myopia can be seen in the party s inability to persuade its rising stars to run for the senate instead of the presidency 3 both parties are unwilling to adopt an economically literate understanding of deficits in this specific context due to the political considerations outlined above this is probably for the best but it s nevertheless insane that both sides in the infrastructure debate are proceeding from the premise that the package must be fully paid for it s idiotic to liken the federal government s finances to those of a household or business since the former can print the world s reserve currency while the latter cannot but even by congress s own delusional a business needs to balance its books so uncle sam should too logic opposing deficit financed capital improvements makes no sense businesses issue debt to make investments in productivity enhancing capital all the time on the state and local level where governments actually do face tight fiscal constraints lawmakers draft separate capital budgets out of recognition that such investments are categorically distinct from other forms of government spending and can be responsibly funded through borrowing you don t need to accept modern monetary theory to understand that at a time of historically low interest rates and stubbornly low inflation there is nothing irresponsible about borrowing money to fix your substandard transportation systems larry summers is no one s idea of a wild eyed radical and he s been endorsing an infrastructure stimulus for years now republicans accept the principle that deficit financed policies can pay for themselves by increasing long term growth when the policy in question is a tax cut which is to say they accept the principle in contexts where it has no empirical support but ask them to apply this logic to investments in productivity enhancing infrastructure and they ll tell you to get realistic the top house republican with jurisdiction over infrastructure transportation committee ranking member sam graves of missouri said a 2 trillion infrastructure plan wasn t realistic senate republican whip john thune of south dakota called it a very very big number and a big tax increase and expressed skepticism that the talks between trump and democrats could yield any kind of proposal that we could actually take a look at finance committee member pat roberts r kan said everybody is for an infrastructure bill you have the usual monetary suspects none of which are popular so i don t know democrats are scarcely better even bernie sanders insists publicly anyway that deficit spending is inherently wrong and a good number of house democrats recently called for adding a balanced budget amendment to the constitution an economically illiterate idea that would devastate the u s economy all of which is to say in many respects our elected leadership lives every week like it s infrastructure week and our government is crumbling into dysfunction as a result

2 02 per share for the 2019 first quarter compared to 219 million 2 42 per share in the 2018 first quarter lower operating profitability was primarily the result of lower year over year earnings in

footnote a is contained in the accompanying notes to financial schedules at the end of this release s craig lindner and carl h lindner iii afg s co chief executive officers commented the year is off to a good start as our core insurance businesses continue to perform very well we reported strong operating earnings in our specialty p c operations and pretax earnings before fair value accounting in our annuity segment that established a new all time quarterly high our diversified portfolio of specialty p c and annuity businesses generated an annualized core operating return on equity of 14 5 in the quarter afg had approximately 1 1 billion of excess capital including parent company cash of approximately 215 million at march 31 2019 where appropriate our excess capital will be deployed into afg s core businesses as we identify potential for healthy profitable organic growth and opportunities to expand our specialty niche businesses through acquisitions and start ups that meet our target return thresholds in addition returning capital to shareholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and opportunistic share repurchases are also an important and effective component of our capital management strategy the 1 50 per share special cash dividend announced today approximately 135 million reflects afg s strong financial position and our confidence in the company s financial future we continue to expect core net operating earnings in 2019 to be between 8 35 and 8 85 per share our core earnings per share guidance excludes non core items such as realized gains and losses as well as other significant items that are not able to be estimated with reasonable precision or that may not be indicative of ongoing operations specialty property and casualty insurance operations core operating earnings in afg s p c insurance operations were 185 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 188 million in the prior year period the specialty p c insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of 88 million in the 2019 first quarter compared to 92 million in the first quarter of 2018 a decrease of 4 higher underwriting profitability in our property and transportation group was more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our specialty casualty and specialty financial groups the first quarter 2019 combined ratio of 92 5 increased 0 8 from the prior year period first quarter 2019 results include 4 0 points of favorable prior year reserve development compared to 5 1 points of favorable development in the comparable prior year period catastrophe losses were 1 1 points of the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2019 by comparison catastrophe losses added 1 2 points in the prior year period gross and net written premiums were up 5 and 4 respectively in the 2019 first quarter compared to the same quarter a year earlier primarily the result of growth within our property and transportation and specialty casualty groups average renewal pricing across our entire p c group was up approximately 1 for the quarter excluding our workers compensation business renewal pricing was up slightly more than 4 an improvement from renewal rate increases achieved in 2018 further details about afg s specialty p c operations may be found in the accompanying schedules the property and transportation group reported an underwriting profit of 39 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 33 million in the first quarter of 2018 higher underwriting profit in our transportation businesses was partially offset by lower underwriting profit in our agricultural property inland marine and ocean marine businesses as well as our singapore branch catastrophe losses in this group were 9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 5 million in the comparable 2018 period first quarter 2019 gross and net written premiums in this group were 3 and 6 higher respectively than the comparable prior year period the growth in gross written premiums is primarily attributable to new business opportunities in our transportation businesses overall renewal rates in this group increased 4 in the first quarter of 2019 an improvement from renewal rate increases achieved in 2018 the specialty casualty group reported an underwriting profit of 36 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 41 million in the comparable 2018 period higher profitability in our targeted markets businesses was more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our excess surplus lines and workers compensation businesses despite lower year over year profit in our workers compensation operations these businesses achieved excellent underwriting margins catastrophe losses for this group were 1 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 5 million in the comparable 2018 period gross and net written premiums for the first quarter of 2019 were up 7 and 5 respectively compared to the same period in 2018 higher year over year gross written premiums within neon resulting from the growth of its portfolio in targeted classes of business the addition of premiums from aba insurance services as well as improved pricing and higher retentions in our excess and surplus lines businesses were the primary drivers of the higher premiums lower premiums in our workers compensation businesses partially offset this growth a change in neon s reinsurance program resulted in proportionally higher cessions of neon s premiums during the 2019 first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2018 renewal pricing for this group was down 1 during the first quarter excluding rate decreases in our workers compensation businesses renewal rates in this group were up 5 an improvement from renewal rate increases achieved in 2018 the specialty financial group reported an underwriting profit of 13 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 15 million in the comparable 2018 period the decrease was driven primarily by lower underwriting profitability in our financial institutions business catastrophe losses for this group were 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a 3 million in the prior year quarter first quarter 2019 gross written premiums were up 3 and net written premiums were down 2 when compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of higher premiums in our fidelity and crime business which were offset by lower premiums in our surety and lending and leasing businesses renewal pricing in this group was up approximately 3 for the quarter carl lindner iii stated our specialty p c group performed very well during the first quarter with strong underwriting margins healthy year over year growth in net written premiums and renewal pricing that is exceeding our objectives based on results during the first quarter we continue to expect an overall 2019 calendar year combined ratio in the range of 92 to 94 and net written premiums to be flat to up 3 when compared to the 5 billion reported in 2018 further

134 million in the first quarter of 2019 driven by growth in the business and the favorable impact of a very strong stock market partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher crediting rates and option costs impact of fair value accounting for fias under gaap a portion of the reserves for fias 3 2 billion and 2 5 billion at march 31 2019 and 2018 respectively is considered an embedded derivative and is recorded at fair value based on the estimated present value of certain expected future cash flows assumptions used in calculating this fair value amount include projected interest rates option costs surrenders withdrawals and mortality variances from these assumptions as well as changes in the stock market will generally result in a change in fair value items such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the stock market are not economic in nature for the current reporting period but rather impact the timing of reported results the impact of fair value accounting for fias includes an ongoing expense for annuity interest accreted on the fia embedded derivative reserve the amount of interest accreted in any period is generally based on the size of the embedded derivative and current interest rates we expect both the size of the embedded derivative and interest rates to rise resulting in continued increases in interest on the embedded derivative liability in the first quarter of 2019 corporate a2 rates decreased by approximately 49 basis points compared to the year end market expectation as indicated by the forward curve that they would increase this difference contributed to a significant unfavorable fair value accounting impact of 45 million 0 39 per share by comparison a 13 increase in the s p 500 index contributed to a favorable fair value accounting impact of 15 million 0 13 per share for the first quarter of 2019 as shown in the table above the majority of the impact of these two items is non economic and is expected to reverse over time by comparison in the first quarter of 2018 the benefit of significantly higher than expected interest rates was minimally offset by the impact of a decrease in the stock market for additional analysis of fair value accounting see our quarterly investor supplement which is posted on afg s website annuity premiums afg s annuity segment reported statutory premiums of 1 40 billion in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 1 15 billion in the first quarter of 2018 an increase of 22 this increase was driven by higher sales of traditional fixed annuities in the financial institutions channel however as a result of decreases in market interest rates over the last several months afg has implemented several rate decreases to its annuity products which are expected to slow sales craig lindner stated i am pleased to report record annuity earnings before the impact of fair value accounting for fias in the first quarter of 2019 providing a strong start for the annuity segment although we are pleased that premiums have grown by 22 year over year interest rates have declined recently which we expect will temper new sales as we remain committed to achieving appropriate returns on new business 2019 annuity outlook due to the strong stock market performance to date in 2019 afg is raising its guidance for full year pretax annuity earnings before fair value accounting by 10 million to a range of 445 million to 475 million in 2019 however due to the impact of decreases in market interest rates to date in 2019 afg expects that its pretax annuity earnings including the impact of fair value accounting will remain as previously forecasted in the range of 365 million to 425 million in 2019 this guidance assumes i interest rates and the stock market rise moderately for the remainder of 2019 ii more normalized income from certain investments required to be marked to market through earnings and iii a lower impact in 2019 from unusual investment income items such as prepayment of fixed income securities fluctuations in these items could lead to significant positive or negative impacts on the annuity segment s results afg is modifying its previously announced 2019 annuity premium guidance based on annuity sales through the first four months of the year however recently implemented rate decreases on its annuity products and a focus on pricing discipline are expected to temper new sales as a result afg now expects its 2019 annuity sales to be flat to down slightly from its record 5 4 billion of premiums in 2018 more information about premiums and the results of

in march italy broke ranks with its eu partners in joining china s belt and road initiative known also as one belt one road or the new silk road students of history know the original silk road refers to the ancient network of trading routes between china and europe which served as both a conduit for the movement of goods and an exchange of ideas for centuries the new silk road is the term for an ambitious trade corridor first proposed by the chinese regime under its current president xi jinping in 2013 the grand design also known confusingly as the belt and road initiative bri is a belt of overland corridors and a road of shipping lanes it consists of a vast network of railways pipelines highways and ports that would extend west through the mountainous former soviet republics and south to pakistan india and southeast asia so far over 60 countries containing two thirds of the world s population have either signed onto bri or say they intend to do so according to the center for foreign relations the chinese government has already spent about 200 billion on the growing list of mega projects projects including the 68 billion china pakistan economic corridor morgan stanley predicts china s expenditures on bri could climb as high as 1 3 trillion by 2027 the belt and road initiative is seen by proponents as an economic driver of proportions never seen before in human history it would not only allow asia to relieve its infrastructure bottleneck ie an 800 billion annual shortfall on infrastructure spending but bring less developed neighboring nations into the modern world by providing a growing market of 1 38 billion chinese consumers opponents argue that is naive and the real intent of bri is to carve new chinese spheres of influence in asia that will replace the united states in debt poor nations to china for decades and restore china to its former imperial glory this article leans heavily towards the latter interpretation of bri particularly its linkages between china s industrial and military build up it explains why belt and road is really a dangerous trojan horse hiding behind china s territorial ambitions that should be resisted especially by vulnerable countries that are risking long term debt servitude the new silk road the silk routes connected china india tibet the persian empire the mediterranean countries and parts of north and east africa the 7 000 mile silk road begins at the chinese city of x an formerly chang an when it reaches dunhuang the silk road splits into three routes the southern route central route and and northern route these trade routes spread throughout the xinjiang uygur autonomous region and extended as far as pakistan india and even rome click to enlarge the silk road routes were established during the han dynasty which opened trade to the west in 130 bc and they lasted until 1453 ad when the ottoman empire boycotted trade with china and closed them the han extended the great wall of china to protect the movement of chinese goods along the silk road the maritime silk road was a network of shipping lines from the red sea to east africa india china and southeast asia the network consisted of ship routes in two general directions the east china sea routes and the south china sea routes related the biggest problem in the cashless revolution the east china sea routes connected the chinese mainland to the northeast asian regions of the liaodong peninsula the korean peninsula and the japanese islands the south china sea route heads down then up through the malacca straits into the bay of bengal opening up china to the coasts of the indian ocean the red sea the persian gulf and the african continent these shipping lanes are still in use as mentioned the belt part of the belt and road initiative introduced by president xi jinping in 2013 refers to a network of overland road and rail routes and oil natural gas pipelines planned to run along the major eurasian land bridges china mongolia russia china central and west asia china indochina peninsula china pakistan bangladesh china india myanmar they ll stretch from xi an in central china through central asia reaching as far as moscow rotterdam and venice the road is a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure projects from south and southeast asia to east africa and the northern mediterranean sea click to enlarge china is already the world s largest consumer of commodities why does it need to build a belt and road there are a few reasons the first as mentioned is to construct physical infrastructure such as railways roads and bridges that will help the region to meet its 800 billion annual infrastructure shortfall estimated by the asian development bank china would also build 50 special economic zones modeled after the shenzhen special economic zone first launched in 1980 under economic reformer president deng xiaoping less benevolently bri would allow china to expand the use of the chinese currency the yuan something we have written about as the global influence of the us dollar as the world s reserve currency wanes according to the centre for foreign relations bri is also a central tenet of xi jinping s pushback against obama s pivot to asia contain china by extending us ties to southeast asia and distancing himself from his predecessors who followed deng s philosophy bide your strength bide your time for xi the waiting is over the time for imperialist expansion is now political aspirations an asia geopolitical expert says that while the new silk road satisfies a number of economic goals for china including expanding its supply chains accessing overseas labor and preventing massive layoffs when companies run out of domestic infrastructure to build the over riding goal is regional influence richard javad heydarian author of asia s new battlefield the usa china and the struggle for the western pacific writes above all however it allows china to lock in precious mineral resources and transform nations across the eurasian land mass and indian ocean into long term debtors a leading credit rating agency recently warned that the obor is driven primarily by china s efforts to extend its global influence where genuine infrastructure needs and commercial logic might be secondary to political motivations the result is what one observer aptly described as debt trap diplomacy since some nations end up piling up unsustainable debts to china click to enlarge meanwhile larger nations such as india have raised concerns over china s geopolitical intensions since the project runs through the disputed kashmir region other countries from indonesia to the philippines and nigeria have raised concerns over the quality of chinese infrastructure investments their compliance with good governance and environmental regulations and beijing s tendency to employ not only chinese technology and engineers but also chinese labourers for overseas projects debt trap so far we have learned the 5ws of the belt and road initiative it s easy to see how the trillion dollar infrastructure network benefits china but what about the 60 odd nations who have said they want in what s in it for them the huge projects need to be paid for somehow china s idea is for chinese state owned firms to build the infrastructure paid for by participating countries those who can t afford it and that is most of them would be offered inexpensive loans and credit it s no different from banks offering rock bottom interest rates to homeowners whose incomes are below that needed to support a mortgage chinese state owned banks and china led international financial institutions like the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib would shoulder the debt burden china has set up an initial 40 billion silk road fund while the aiib is allocating an additional 50 billion but the loans come with huge risks related africa s first unicorn ipo is coming to the nyse in 2017 when sri lanka couldn t pay off its chinese creditors beijing took control of colombo a strategic port through a 99 year lease by the end of 2018 nearly a quarter of sri lanka s foreign debt was owed to china the money accepted for around 8 billion worth of ports and highways planned through bri some countries have scaled back or canceled bri projects due to the specter of unsustainable debt burdens states al jazeera hopefully italy is aware of the risks the southern european country is heavily in debt and went into recession last year it reportedly wants to re balance sino italian trade by exporting more to china it is the 13th eu member country that has signed an mou with china regarding bri but the first g7 nation to do so sparking condemnation from the united states which is engaged in a trade war with china and the eu which earlier this year branded china a systemic rival and wants to restrict chinese investment in europe al jazeera said military buildup is it a coincidence that the chinese president xi jingping is racing around trying to sign countries onto bri while at the same time posing for photos in full military uniform saluting chinese soldiers we don t think so tuesday was the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s liberation army pla and the chinese navy did not squander the opportunity to show its latest show of power a stealth destroyer according to a reuters story the combat ready 10 000 ton nanchang 101 is armed with 113 vertical launch sales able to fire hhq 0 surface to air missiles yj 18 anti cruise missiles and cj 10 land attack cruise missiles we have written extensively on the escalating tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei ongoing maneuvers demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china is increasing its military drills around japan with japanese interceptors scrambled 638 times within a year against chinese aircraft according to japan s annual military white paper there are also frequent tensions in the taiwan strait the body of water separating china and taiwan a us ally the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced reunification between china and taiwan would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us meanwhile china continues to expand its military a year ago it was reported that china planned to boost military spending by 8 1 in 2018 compared to a 7 increase in 2017 click to enlarge a reuters in depth report on how china is displacing america as the world s predominant military power in asia is required reading for anyone interested in how the geopolitical balance of power in the north pacific is shifting it details how xi jinping is overhauling the pla which includes the navy by pouring more resources into the navy and ridding the pla s ranks of corruption in just over two decades china has built a force of conventional missiles that rival or outperform those in the u s armory china s shipyards have spawned the world s biggest navy which now rules the waves in east asia beijing can now launch nuclear armed missiles from an operational fleet of ballistic missile submarines giving it a powerful second strike capability and the pla is fortifying posts across vast expanses of the south china sea while stepping up preparations to recover taiwan by force if necessary for the first time since portuguese traders reached the chinese coast five centuries ago china has the military power to dominate the seas off its coast conflict between china and the united states in these waters would be destructive and bloody particularly a clash over taiwan according to serving and retired senior american officers and despite decades of unrivaled power since the end of the cold war there would be no guarantee america would prevail the u s could lose said gary roughead co chair of a bipartisan review of the trump administration s defense strategy published in november we really are at a significant inflection point in history industry military connection we know that china is planning a huge infrastructure buildout in its trillion dollar bri involving some 60 odd countries and we know that beijing is at the same time bulking up its military what we don t know is if the two are related is china covertly funneling money from bri into its military in december 2018 the new york times reported on a secret proposal to expand a program by the pakistani air force by building chinese military jets weaponry and other hardware there would also be increased cooperation between china and pakistan in space where rocket propelled technology often overlaps with the military according to the article the military projects were designated as part of china s belt and road initiative in response to that claim cnbc quoted michael fuchs a senior fellow at the center for american progress and a former u s deputy assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs from 2013 to 2016 that doesn t necessarily mean the chinese military will use the entire bri to its advantage but it will certainly tap into a number of projects he added bri infrastructure schemes in member countries such as pakistan sri lanka and djibouti are all about giving access to china s military he said a 2018 report by c4ads a us based research group sought to tease out whether china s portrayal of bri as strictly economic is true as explained by south china morning post the report looked at 15 chinese funded port projects in bangladesh sri lanka cambodia australia oman malaysia indonesia djibouti and elsewhere in the indo pacific region it found that the projects were not win win for china and the host countries as china claimed rather the investments appear to generate political influence stealthily expand china s military presence and create an advantageous strategic environment in the region the report stated resource raids of course none of this should come as a shock if we look at how china has repeatedly sought raw materials necessary to feed its resource ravenous economy we ve covered how china is locking up critical resources in the us s own backyard we also know that bri whatever china s motivations is going to require a hell of a lot more mined commodities it doesn t have an abundance of like copper zinc iron ore etc mining com reported in under 10 years the number of china headquartered mining companies with assets in africa went from just a handful in 2006 to 120 in 2015 two high profile examples are the acquisition by china general nuclear power corporation of the husab uranium project in namibia and zijin mining s involvement 39 6 in the massive kamoa kakula copper deposit in the drc while iron ore and copper have been the hot targets of overseas acquisitions by chinese firms the chinese have also gone after gold nickel tin and coking coal more recently the most desired metals are those that feed into the tectonic global shift from fossil fuels to the electrification of vehicles china molybdenum bought the tenke copper and cobalt mine in the democratic republic of congo for 2 65 billion in an effort to secure a supply of cobalt for ev batteries last summer china s ganfeng lithium paid chilean state lithium miner 87 5 million for sqm s 50 stake in the cauchari olaroz lithium project in argentina the purchase means china now effectively controls half of the world s lithium production necessary for lithium ion batteries conclusion china s ascent from an economic backwater to a 21st century superpower is nothing short of incredible within 30 years the country whose citizenry was oppressed impoverished and riding around on bicycles is now the world s biggest consumer of mined commodities influences real estate markets worldwide just look at vancouver and has obscenely rich people driving 100 000 luxury cars except for its horrible air quality china is now the envy of many poorer countries but that doesn t mean they should roll over and let china take advantage of its weaker brethren the belt and road initiative is not some modern day asian version of the marshall plan the united states had obvious economic motivations in giving 12 billion to help rebuild western europe but there was also the strategic imperative of helping europe to get back on its feet in order to contain a rising ussr no such threat exists with bri china has no reason to come to its neighbors aid with multi billion dollar infrastructure loans other than to gain economic and political influence over them sure there may be some programs where it s a win win but it appears the deck is way stacked against bri host nations where the outcome will almost certainly leave china the clear winner as uncle ben in spider man said with great power comes great responsibility that assumes that the one wielding the power doesn t have an ulterior motive with china though we can be pretty much certain it does by richard mills more top reads from safehaven com

introduce martin franklin executive chairman of element solutions for opening remarks martin martin e franklin executive chairman thank you yash and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call my introductory remarks will be brief but i felt it important to make a few comments about our team s accomplishments during the first quarter we had a very productive quarter our transformation is well under way and ben and his team are doing all the right things internally to laid the foundation for a bright future our new leadership team is bringing the fresh thinking and the energy we expected and our people around the world are reacting enthusiastically to these changes given the new office of the chairman structure i have a much closer view of our commercial functional and strategic activities you will hear more specifics bout progress throughout the call and i believe we are moving in the right direction whereas in most focus is people and culture and we re really making strides there as well our new leadership team has gelled nicely and we are very pleased with the additions to our board announced last week chris fraser former chairman and ceo of kmg chemicals is a deeply experienced chemical industry executive who brings a great background and ability to contribute to our board i m delighted to welcome him to our ranks we re also very happy to add our president and coo scot benson to our board so after the close of the arysta transaction we repurchased 37 million shares or approximately 13 of our shares outstanding at the end market price we were happy to be able to buyback that many shares in a single transaction and believe that transaction will translate to material long term value creation this buyback for our leverage up to our cap of 3 5 times so between our cash flow generation and earnings growth over the balance of the year we believe leverage should be at 3 times or below again by the end of the year borrowing any further buybacks we will continue to be buyers of our own stock at these valuation levels should that opportunity arise as our leverage improves our leverage ratio improves as you ll hear our end markets have been quite challenging and our progress exceeds what the numbers show for the first half of this year our time horizon here is long and we believe we are doing the right things foundationally to set this company up for long term success and to maximize benefit from end market recovery with that i ll let ben scot and carey take you through the quarter and will rejoin for the questions at the end ben benjamin gliklich chief executive officer thank you martin and good morning everyone starting on slide 3 as martin said we had a very productive quarter from the close of the arysta transaction on january 31st and the subsequent launch of our new company together with our share repurchase this was an active three months in addition to our ongoing commercial operations we made progress on many fronts we solidified our leadership ranks with an internally organization most notably with my stepping into the seat as where in the ceo seat as rakesh sachdev retired and carey dorman promotion to cfo and we added to our board as martin mentioned we are excited to have chris fraser and scot benson joined us on the board as of last week our reorganization also materially contributed to our cost savings which are coming along the one we realized an additional 3 million of cost savings in the quarter and that delivered 8 million cumulatively in the last three quarters we are well on our way to our goal of 25 million in annualized cost savings that we committed to in the context of the arysta sale since february 1st we spend a lot of time on the road communicating our vision for the company our strategy and our cultural priorities internally to our colleagues around the world and to investors we were pleased by the receptivity and look forward to seeing more of you and going into more detail at our investor day in new york on may 20th our end markets did not help us this quarter the softness we saw toward the end of last year persisted into q1 with mobile device industry shipments continuing to be down in the mid teens and the automotive market particularly in china remaining quite weak these are two of our biggest end markets and their softness translated into a weak top line we offset this weakness through cost actions resulting in adjusted ebitda growth of 1 year over year on a constant currency basis despite our topline being down 3 organically the resilience that our variable cost structure provides is a hallmark of our businesses in periods of macro weakness like the one we are in right now cash flow generation was strong excluding the impact of our capital structure for the month of january and transaction costs the business would have generated 54 million in free cash flow on an adjusted basis in the first quarter we believe the cash flow characteristics of our businesses and the returns on capital are a real distinguishing factor which unfortunately were obfuscated by debt service and the legacy platform structure balance sheet and arysta working capital requirements this will change this year even with the challenging market environment and we look forward to that cash flow showing up on the balance sheet we do not expect a recovery in q2 but we are optimistic for the second half as our customers and the overall industry tone are positive looking toward that period in that context we are reaffirming our full year adjusted eps guidance of 0 82 to 0 87 but moderating our organic top line expectations given the persisting pressure we see in our end markets on page 4 you can see more detail on our first quarter 2019 financial results we reported net sales of 460 million and adjusted ebitda of 99 million net sales declined 3 on an organic basis year over year while adjusted ebitda was up 1 on a constant currency basis we anticipated the continued softness in higher end mobile and automotive markets as well as lagging industrial production across europe and asia and during the year and we do believe our business is meaningfully outperformed these end markets our electronic segment experienced an organic sales decline of approximately 5 in the quarter with another 4 headwind from fx translation semiconductor solutions realised modest organic growth while assembly solutions are 2 organic net sales decline our circuitry solutions business accounted for most of the organic net sales decline in the segment at it is more directly tied to higher end mobile markets which saw the most severe demand softness in the quarter our semiconductor solutions products continued to perform well in the electric vehicle defence and telecom markets despite a broader slowdown in ship growth in q1 we ve introduced new products and continue to gain traction in the advanced packaging market within the semiconductor space assembly solutions experienced more mixed end markets but its diversification helped offset some of the negative volume trends that more directly impacted our circuitry business most of the softness we experienced within our asian business and we believe some of that is driven by the ongoing trade tension which we hope will be resolved soon our industrial and speciality segment organic net sales were flat year over year with growth and energy solutions and some volume softness in graphics driven by a slow start to the year in that market particularly europe our industrial solutions vertical experienced flat organic net sales has share gains and increasing pricing offset negative trends in automotive related products this lead to overall organic net sales growth in the americas and europe and declined in asia primarily china due to automotive units adjusted ebitda was up 1 year on year on a constant currency basis the negative 6 million impact of fx translation this quarter was consistent with our prior guidance and driven largely by the yuan euro and pound we drove margin expansion despite a declining top line through successful execution on our corporate restructuring plans containment of variable operating expenses and certain procurement and supply chain savings initiatives as we progressed through the year we anticipate these cost savings will increase as many of the actions were mid quarter or have been actioned but not yet realized into the p l our supply chain actions list continues to grow and many of the markets where we are seeing or expecting growth are higher margin opportunities for us this should also provide an expected margin tailwind we ll provide more detail on this progress at our investor day gaap loss per share this quarter was 0 02 impacted by fx and one time items associated with the arysta sale and offset by reduced interest expense and a lower share count adjusted eps of 0 20 this quarter represents a significant improvement over the prior year adjusted eps of 0 04 due primarily to the improved balance sheet and our share repurchase this first quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our businesses against dramatic swings in end markets we believe our highly variable cost structure and our sticky customer relationships help mitigate challenging macros and preserve margins and cash flow we know how to navigate challenging markets and what levers to pull in those times to deliver financial outperformance with that let me turn the call to scot to provide more color on our activities and the end markets scot scot r benson president chief operating officer thanks ben and good morning everyone in the electronics segment we have seen a continuation of q4 2018 industry volume trends the most impactful to us has been weakness in higher end mobile phone supply chains in china and korea however this is not just been the share shifting story to lower priced devices as overall mobile units were down double digits year over year in q1 we believe that this has both macro drivers like trade tension and slower global gdp growth as well as replacement cycle drivers as model over model innovation is slowing and consumers await 5g phone launches we have also previously discussed the increasing electronic content in automotive there is an important growth driver for our business which of course is also been impacted over the past few quarters by lower auto production despite content per unit continuing to increase ultimately we believe most of these cycles will reverse and we believe our businesses will be well positioned when they do one major initiative we have undertaken in the past several quarters is the integration of our former electronics and assembly businesses under a new macdermid alpha brand we have taken two powerful businesses with similar end markets and related customers and combine them into one product portfolio commercial organization and supply chain this new business offers a broad product offering and electronics expertise to our customers and to oems our objective is to provide a single touch point for electronics chemistry solutions and we are already working on several needle moving initiatives that benefit from the combination of products technologies and our development capabilities as new technologies and smartphone features such as larger display screens and newer camera modules drive the need for more complex printed circuit boards and assembly materials macdermid alpha should benefit in a meaningful way the ongoing trade tensions with china are disrupting certain customers production and pushing several key electronic manufacturers to transfer production to other countries as we have highlighted in prior calls we have a highly adaptable supply chain and have been investing in growth markets outside of china to meet this demand we continue to monitor the situation and we ll work directly with our customers and tier ones to ensure our part of their global manufacturing process is as efficient as possible as we look to the rest of 2019 we currently have cautiously optimistic view toward a second half pick up which aligns with the phasing of our financial guidance for the year in our industrial and specialty segment we experienced relatively flat organic net sales in the quarter as we were able to benefit from certain pricing initiatives and share gain opportunities in industrial solutions this helped to offset some declines in automotive markets specifically in europe and asia we continue to work on new product development across our industrial solutions portfolio as evolving technologies in automotive markets required greater reliability standards for our surface treatment chemistries in graphics solutions although we experienced slower market conditions in the first quarter we expect recovery in the balance of the year and have seen green shoots in april our primary focus has been in emerging markets such as china and india where we are still seeing a transitional shift of analog to digital within the flexographic printing space itself we have also successfully launched several new products to meet the increasing demand for flexo print quality energy solutions grew during the first quarter but we expect the rest of 2019 will be negatively impacted by the loss of a piece of business in march overall our commercial teams have embraced element solutions and have a clear focus on our operational strategy of driving growth through innovation and service we believe our end market weakness is cyclical not sector specific and that we will be well positioned to return to above market organic growth once the markets recover now let me turn the call over to carey who will discuss cash flow and our balance sheet carey carey dorman chief financial officer thanks scot on page 6 we provide an update on our cash flow and our balance sheet for the first quarter we completed the sale of arysta on january 31st so this quarters reported cash flow burden by one month of interest expense from our prior capital structure if we were to assume that the arysta transactions had closed and our new capital structure have been in place at the january 1st would have generated approximately 54 million of free cash flow for this quarter in line with our full year annualized expectation this includes cash taxes of 14 million and net capital expenditures of 7 million our 2019 outlook for both cash taxes and capex remain unchanged and we continue to drive tax documentation activity to materially reduce our future cash taxes while we typically invest a moderate amount of working capital throughout the first two or three quarters of the year the investment of this quarter was minimal we should expect this when revenues are down sequentially as we indicated by reaffirming our financial guidance the anticipated demand recovery in some of our key end markets in the second half and therefore expect working capital investments to grow sequentially albeit modestly throughout most of the year importantly the seasonal patterns are significantly less volatile than our legacy business for most of the volatility and intensity was driven by the agricultural solutions segment with our new capital structure in place cash interest for the year should be around 80 million the interest rate on our debt is substantially fixed due to swaps so we will not be any material impacts from fluctuating underlying interest rate overall our cash flow characteristics had markedly improved post the arysta transaction and we ve demonstrated that this quarter despite challenging market backdrop our net leverage ratio at quarter end was just under 3 5 times adjusted ebitda we had 1 4 billion of net debt which reflects the funding of our share buyback in q1 and the partial settlement of a contingent consideration associated with our previous acquisition of macdermid we enjoy liquidity of over 450 million at quarter end we are also working to efficiently repatriate cash to u s in order to further reduce our gross debt and related interest charge i should also note that our balance sheet does not reflect the expected positive impact of the final post closing adjustments related to the arysta transaction which should be finalized by the time of our next conference call as we generate cash and growth adjusted ebitda throughout the year we expect to continue to consider opportunistic capital allocation including for the share buybacks to drive long term value creation we picked up capacity to invest but we will be measured i mean focused on our goal of keeping our net leverage ratio below 3 5 times adjusted ebitda with that i will turn it over to ben to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2019 and to closing remarks ben benjamin gliklich chief executive officer thanks carry on slide 7 we discussed our expectations for the remainder of the year we are reaffirming our full year adjusted eps guidance of 0 82 to 0 87 and adjusted ebitda guidance of 5 to 8 year over year growth on a constant currency basis given continued soft market trends in the first quarter we are tempering our organic net sales growth expectations for the year to a new range of flat to 2 growth however we believe we have cost measures to compensate for that change that allow us to hold our adjusted ebitda adjusted eps guidance our march sales were roughly in line with the average of january and a weaker february driven by chinese new year and april is trending similarly our expectation for the second quarter is that these levels will continue our top line guidance is predicated on a recovery in demand in asian electronics in the second half of the year growth in content per unit and market share opportunities should both help our organic growth in electronics but this market recovery is important in industrial and specialty we continue to progress on share gain opportunities product launches and pricing initiatives across our verticals to offset uncertain market trends based on exchange rates at 33 1 ph on a full year basis we still anticipate about 15 million of fx translation headwinds to adjusted ebitda we expect in q2 a headwind similar to the 6 million headwind we experienced in q1 overall we believe achieving our guidance for 2019 will be a strong accomplishment in light of our end markets we expect the element solutions businesses to grow net sales organically in the longer term at mid single digits this will not necessarily happen every year given the cyclicality of our end markets nonetheless we do expect to deliver above market sales performance and stable margins every year which is what we expect these results would translate to in 2019 finally turning to slide 8 you can see an outline of our key priorities for the year i ve been telling my colleagues around the world and our investors that i ve one single objective this year which is the successful launch of element solutions of course this objective has many components several of which are on this list the successful launch of element solutions entails establishing or recognized identity with all of our stakeholders a strong performance based people centric culture of ownership and integrity that take hold in the business and progress toward building our reputation as a high performing leading specialty chemicals company i m hopeful that our investor day on may 20th will contribute materially toward this objective the successful launch of element solutions also requires delivering on our financial commitments and key strategic initiatives which should in turn demonstrate and deliver strong free cash flow generation for many years we have chartered the cash flow characteristics of these businesses but that cash was absorbed by debt service we re looking forward to that cash showing up on the balance sheet in the quarters to come finally we ve many opportunities to deploy our robust cash flow to uses that will compound shareholder value our buyback earlier this year was one and we look forward to the ability to be flexible and opportunistic in deploying our capital with the aim to deliver attractive returns to shareholders while remaining within our leverage target of 3 5 times adjusted ebitda before opening the call of the questions i d like to thank my colleagues around the world for their contributions in this quarter and for embracing element solutions and their optimism and enthusiasm for our future operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator the floor is now open for questions operator instruction thank you our first question is coming from daniel jester with citi your line is open daniel jester citi analyst yeah hi good morning everyone so first a couple of questions on the revenue outlook first could you be specific about where the cut was in the organic revenue growth outlook for 2019 is that the lost business that you referenced in energy or is there something else driving that slowdown and then secondly on revenue throughout your prepared remarks in your slide deck you talked a lot about market share opportunities can you just talk about what gives you the confidence that you re going to be able to take share given some of the challenges you talked about carey dorman chief financial officer sure absolutely we ll take those questions in order so first with regard to the cutting our revenue guidance it s simply the persisting weakness we ve seen across many of our end markets we anticipated weakness given what we saw in the back half of last year but it s been i d say a little bit more dire in a little bit longer term based on what we re seeing right now we do however has some real confidence in the back half as we ve articulated in our prepared remarks and in the slides that we provide it s got anything you d say with regard to the revenue cut or guidance change scot r benson president chief operating officer no i think carey just we ll confirm what you re saying that the slowdown then with bit more persistent than we had anticipated yeah carey dorman chief financial officer with regard to your second question about market share this is an area of real focus and one we ve been putting technology and discipline behind our selling process and it s been an area that we ve been investing in materially we have a chief sales officer is implemented technology and process that s given us a lot more data around our sales process and our sales targeting so we ve got insight into that what our key accounts or how we re tracking along toward winning those accounts and so we feel pretty good about our ability to add major customers and gain market share over the balance of the year which is something that gives us comfort in addition to an expected recovery in the back half in the market sentiment driving that that we re going to be able to outperform and grow operator and our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays your line is open michael leithead barclays capital analyst hey guys it s mike leithead on for duffy this morning i guess first question for ben tying in a little bit to the last question you have embedded a second half recovery in your ebitda guidance i was hoping maybe you could just talk through in size two or three the factors they expect to be better in the second half versus the first half year benjamin gliklich chief executive officer sure so i think the place to start this is the back half of last year was quite soft and so the comps as we roll through the second half will be much more favorable the second is that and i m sure you ve heard this from many of the industry participants around us but the tone from the industry from our supply chain from our customers is that the second half will be better we have optimism and we ve seen optimism around product launches in the second half and mobile phones and also around semiconductor market recovering from a data perspective we don t have too many empirical data points that support that second half recovery but we don t have any evidence to the contrary ultimately as we think about this we can t control volumes in our end markets but our ebitda guidance can sustain a flat top line due to our flexible business model and variable cost model and our ability to control costs is something that we prided ourselves on and something we re very focused on we re hoping for the best but preparing for the worst from a cost perspective to enable us to deliver our guidance michael leithead barclays capital analyst got it that s super helpful and then second question for martin it seems like with the change in portfolio as well as leadership your role in the company has evolved somewhat so i was hoping you could just touch on one or two of your new areas of focus with the company and how you see the longer term story for element of developing overtime martin e franklin executive chairman sure i mean we created this office of the chairman structure i m spending a lot of my time with ben and scot we ve gone really around the planet visited pretty much every corner of our major business segments and it s all about cultural building so at the end of the day i m there to if you like to provide a lot of support and guidance to ben take a lot of the experiences that i ve had over the years in culture building at the business that i build in jarden and applying those types of approaches and disciplines to element i think that it s been very enlightening we had a lot of great conversation and come out with a lot of if you like priority list of things that need to be done and opportunities that exist but overall it s really more of what i did in the past but being a lot closer to it if you like and really giving ben some insights on to some of the if you like points is about being the ceo operator and our next question comes from josh spector with ubs your line is open josh spector ubs analyst yeah hey guys so in electronics you talked about some of the trade tensions may be shifting the production days i was wondering if you could kind of walk us through in your customers process when they re looking at moving production from one country to another how they were called us selecting a new supplier and kind related to that how element could benefit scot r benson president chief operating officer yeah hi guys this is scot there s a lot of factors obviously i can t really speak to all the decision process that our customers go through but generally speaking we see we do see the opportunity to follow the supply chain and the fact that we are truly global and we ve invested in all these growth markets has helped us because they can t get the same processes in these new countries without having to make any changes within their supply chain so specification etc so our ability to give them exactly the same thing they re using in one country in any country they choose to move to really factors into how we can follow that supply chain carey dorman chief financial officer the real opportunity for us the competitive dynamics in some of these markets outside of china or better and favorable for us relative to the domestic chinese market josh spector ubs analyst so then who would you say you re winning share from there would it be more local producers then or would it be some of your global peers scot r benson president chief operating officer well as they move into newer countries generally it s global competitors the local competitor situation is less for us in those areas so we competent in the emerging our growth markets more against the global competitors carey dorman chief financial officer as opposed to in china where multiple speakers domestic producers operator and we will take our next question from steve byrne with bank of america your line is open steve byrne bank of america analyst yes thank you wanted to ask first a little bit about the share count was it at the end of the quarter is it fair to assume that is incorporated into your reaffirmation of eps guidance for the year that the lower share count and do you have any view on potential timing of taking action on the remaining portion of the share repo authorization carey dorman chief financial officer hi steve it s carey good morning so on a gaap basis at the end of the quarter we had 268 million shares outstanding both basic and diluted on an adjusted basis we are using a number of 262 million for the quarter that s fully reflective of the 37 million shares that we repurchased from pershing earlier in the year benjamin gliklich chief executive officer and we updated our guidance to reflect that buyback when we made it and i would say that and i think we made this comment in our prepared remarks in the back half of the year depending on availability and depending on where our share price is we re buyers of our stock at this price at these levels but we will wait until we have plenty of room in our stated leverage cap to exercise that but if we did no buybacks we d be around three times or below three times leverage which would give us capacity to second half obviously to execute share repurchases should market conditions be appropriate steve byrne bank of america analyst and ben you talked a little bit about share gains in some of your end markets and wanted to just drill into whether you have some visibility on your product share within potentially new devices or next generation products that are either getting launched in electronics or in autos are you already in on those new devices such as in 5g is your share going to be larger with those new products benjamin gliklich chief executive officer yeah so you know the general comment we tend to have outsized share in the higher end innovative new platforms than we do in lower end electronics particularly in the circuitry business with regard to new launches so the new launches that we see coming toward the end of the year we generally know what our businesses on new launches well in advance what we don t know is the production rates that translate into sales so we ve got a good sense of where we are going to be playing and what our shares on those products but we don t have visibility into units which translates into the top line we do see ourselves is taking market share through the new platforms that are coming out we also on the automotive side of the business have been investing quite a bit in building our presence and being a solutions provider on multiple touch points and we ll talk about this much more at the investor day across electronics displays and plating in automotive which is driving market share for us as well operator and our next question comes from robert koort with goldman sachs your line is open goldman sachs analyst technical difficulty sorry guys sorry this is inaudible on for bob i just had a question on your visibility so you re expecting in second half rebound what kind of gives you the confidence here and do you have the specific visibility on customer behavior like out a few months or quarters or how does that shape out benjamin gliklich chief executive officer as we were just talking about we do have line of sight into our share our scope on new platforms that are launching in electronics also on automotive but we don t have direct line of sight beyond our customers which speaks to production rates which translate to the top line so as we said the tone from the industry from the supply chain from our customers is very positive with regard to the second half both in terms of new platforms that are launching in terms of the semiconductor market recovery but from a data perspective we don t have much in terms of empirical data that supports this we also don t have any evidence to the contrary so while we can t control volumes we can control costs and we re focusing on preparing for the worst and hoping for the best and through cost we believe we can still deliver on our guidance operator and we can take our next question from yefremov aleksey with nomura instinet your line is open yefremov aleksey nomura instinet analyst thank you good morning everyone on free cash flow you generated pro forma 54 million in q1 you mentioned there were some maybe more favorable working capital more favorable working capital this quarter for the full year can we roughly annualized this q1 results benjamin gliklich chief executive officer so aleksey good morning i think in general if you were to take our ebitda guidance today and items that we ve given you on capex cash taxes and cash interest you would get to something close to annualizing this q1 normalized number as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we do expect with the growth in the back half to see some incremental working capital investment relative to q1 so it wouldn t be necessarily normalizing for annualizing networking capital number but on a full year basis you should see effectively an annualized q1 yefremov aleksey nomura instinet analyst thank you understood and you mentioned several times that you d expect recovery in the second half and that s embedded in your ebitda guidance for year is that recovery does not come how should we think about sort of the downside case for this year again similarly is sort of the q1 a good run rate and maybe somewhere around 400 million is that downside case absent recovery benjamin gliklich chief executive officer no likely that s not where we would point you toward as you know this is a highly variable cost model there s more we can do from a cost perspective to protect margins and to drive earnings up we ve got a long list of actions that we re prepared to take if we don t see that recovery materialize and i would also note that in the first quarter you ve got the chinese new year which deflates the run rate if you will on the quarter so there are few factors that would drive us again as i said closer to our guidance range even without that recovery really driven by cost operator and our next question comes from jon tanwanteng with cjs securities your line is open jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst good morning gentlemen nice job on the margins first can you tell us if you re feeling any potential for chinese stimulus efforts particularly into our own consumer spaces into your guidance number one and number two what do you think normalized margin growth look like if trade tensions ultimately resolve and if you add a good proxy for 2020 performance carey dorman chief financial officer yeah it s a good question john so i think the place we started is in our prepared remarks i mean the comment that april was looking roughly like march at the moment and march was about an average of january and february so we are seeing a stabilized level in april we haven t seen an uptick associated with the stimulus you ve spoken to but obviously we ve heard about it and that s part of what s giving us confidence in the second half recovery with regard to our progress in our margins and steady state growth we have many reasons to believe we have margin expansion that we can deliver over the coming quarters and years from corporate cost savings that we ve been delivering well on other functional cost opportunities we ve identified in general mix we see a path toward several points of margin expansion over the next couple of years with regard to growth as we talked about visibility isn t terrific certainly not for 2020 at this point but we do believe that sort of normalized growth rate through the cycle is low to mid single digit gdp plus we talked about a couple of points better than the market so call it 4 5 and we do anticipate being able to deliver that on a through the cycle basis in addition to the margin expansion we ve talked about jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great and then just a follow up ben and martin with the notchier new board appointments can you give us an update on your marketing competitive positioning against consolidating peer group and the electronic chemistry markets benjamin gliklich chief executive officer yeah it s a good question we ve obviously seen some of the strategic activity and consolidation in electronics materials that activity doesn t really impact us we are leaders in the markets in which we participate in that consolidation is and damaging our market position and our ability to provide value and grow in our markets so we re very comfortable with where we are and from a strategic perspective m a around us isn t changing our strategy martin e franklin executive chairman yeah no i completely agree with that there is definitely activity that s going on around us we are keeping our heads down and driving our business internally as we said that before you ll hear that on the investor day obviously we have one if you like potential comp which would be as i said which we don t know whether that s the company that s going to go public or be sold its owned by private equity in a way would be nice to see it as a public company because i think it would enhance the multiples for how this company is perceived in trade if we have to go it alone and gets the most profit this business probably does we ll take we ll do it on our own with u s operator and we will take our next question from jim sheehan with suntrust your line is open pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning this is pete osterland on for jim on energy prices have you seen the higher oil prices translate into increased volumes in the offshore and market so far in the second quarter and how much growth do you think it is possible in that vertical this year if you assume oil prices stay around where they are benjamin gliklich chief executive officer so our offshore business has much longer lead times than onshore energy markets and so that is one business where we have pretty good visibility associated with new production coming online in drilling activity increasing we have seen capex increased from our customers which does overtime translate into growth for us but it s not as instantaneous as you see onshore we made a comments in our prepared remarks about that business having had a loss this quarter which will impact growth and we will see that business declined modestly this year but it s a great business and the secular growth trends outside of this specific instance are very compelling we should see growth in that business over time pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you and in the automotive end market could you quantify how your organic volume growth currently compares to the underlying market and how do you expect this to trend this year if underlying unit production improves in the second half benjamin gliklich chief executive officer yeah so for us obviously units are very important content for unit added bonus and we are seeing material increase in content per unit which impact both the electronics business and our industrial surface coatings business we see those two things combining to allow us to out perform units and we should continue to see that for many many years to come that s a mega trend that s very exciting for us operator this does conclude today s q a session i d like to turn the program back over to mr benjamin gliklich for any additional or closing remarks benjamin gliklich chief executive officer thanks aaron and thanks to all for participating we look forward to seeing many of you at the investor day on may 20th and continuing to tell the element solutions story broadly in the quarters to come thanks very much operator thank you for your participation this does conclude today s program you may

coming months amid signs of renewed economic health but unusually low inflation the fed left its benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 the central bank s low rate policy has helped boost stock prices and supported a steadily growing economy whose outlook has brightened since late last year the fed did make a technical adjustment to trim the interest it pays banks on reserves to 2 35 percent as a way to keep its benchmark rate inside its approved range the decision wednesday to make no change in the policy rate policy had been expected despite renewed pressure from president donald trump for the fed to cut rates aggressively to help accelerate economic growth the fed statement had a more upbeat view of the economy saying that economic activity rose at a solid rate in march the fed said that it appeared growth had slowed from the fourth quarter ___ 12 15 p m stocks are edging higher on wall street and bond yields are lower ahead of the federal reserve s latest policy statement investors will be closely parsing the fed s announcement which is due out later wednesday afternoon particularly any references to how the fed thinks the economy is doing assurances from the fed late last year that any interest rate increases in 2019 were unlikely helped the stock market recover from a steep rout investors had worried that the fed could destabilize the economy if it continued raising borrowing costs the s p 500 and the dow jones industrial average were both up about 0 1 at midday bond prices rose after a report on the manufacturing sector came in weaker than analysts anticipated the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 2 48 ___ 4 45 a m stock markets are edging higher ahead of a federal reserve policy meeting at which the central bank is not expected to change its interest rates but could give clues on their future direction futures for the dow and the s p 500 are both up 0 4 the indexes that are open for trading in europe where much of the region is closed for a holiday are also up slightly with britain s ftse 100 up 0 1 the dollar was steady against the yen and euro fed chairman jerome powell will hold a news conference after the fed meeting ends wednesday economists expect the fed to say that it will not increase its key interest rates anytime soon as it monitors the health of the u s and global economy low rates tend to help stock markets and the economy by making it cheaper to borrow money president donald trump has called for what no mainstream economist is advocating interest rate cuts ___ 12 05 a m the federal reserve is all but sure to keep interest rates on hold wednesday and for the foreseeable future even as president donald trump keeps up his attacks on the fed for not cutting rates the fed will likely reiterate a message that has reassured consumers and investors since the start of the year no rate hikes are likely anytime soon the fed s low rate policy is keeping borrowing costs down helping boost stock prices and supporting an economy that s growing steadily and with inflation remaining tame the fed is seen as able to stay on the sidelines at least through this year yet trump insists the economy can do better and to that end he is demanding what almost no mainstream economist would favor cutting rates further copyright the associated press all rights

adjusted income before income taxes and the related margin ii ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income before allocation to non controlling interests and iii net homebuilding debt to total capitalization ratio adjusted income before income taxes is a non gaap financial measure that reflects our income before income taxes excluding the impact of significant and unusual transactions which in the quarter were transaction expenses related to our acquisition of av homes adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that measures performance by adjusting net income to exclude interest amortized to cost of sales and interest income net income taxes depreciation and amortization non cash compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt if any net homebuilding debt to capitalization is a non gaap financial measure we calculate by dividing i total debt less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents by ii total capitalization the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders equity management uses these non gaap financial measures to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis as well as the performance of our regions and to set targets for performance based compensation we also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry in the future we may include additional adjustments in the above described non gaap financial measures to the extent we deem them appropriate and useful to management and investors we believe that adjusted income before income taxes and related margin as well as ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because such metric assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business adjusted ebitda also provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates levels of depreciation or amortization or unusual items because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason these non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the comparable u s gaap financial measures of our operating performance or liquidity although other companies in the homebuilding industry may report similar information their definitions may differ we urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled non gaap financial measures

represents adjusted net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd divided by the weighted average or by the diluted weighted average of shares outstanding as applicable at the end of the reporting period we believe this measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis adjusted net income adjusted net income represents net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items include the transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the acquisition the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by silversea cruises group ltd s noncontrolling interest the impairment loss related to skysea holding and the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards available passenger cruise days apcd apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary constant currency we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant non gaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because our reporting currency is the us dollar the value of these revenues and expenses in us dollars will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel in constant currency i e as if the current period s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period s rates we calculate constant currency by applying the average prior year period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and or forecasted period so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods we do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods it should be emphasized that the use of constant currency is primarily used by us for comparing short term changes and or projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency based fluctuations gross cruise costs gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses for the periods presented gross cruise costs exclude transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition and the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards which were included within marketing selling and administrative expenses gross yields gross yields represent total revenues per apcd net cruise costs ncc and ncc excluding fuel net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance net revenues net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses net yields net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a day to day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses occupancy occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins passenger cruise days passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises for additional information see adjusted measures of

review of generally strong first quarter results and execution against our strategic priorities and an update on the transaction with oceanwide first a brief review of our results advertisement advertisement in the first quarter genworth generated 121 million in adjusted operating income or 0 24 per diluted share compared with adjusted operating income of 125 million or 0 25 per diluted share in the prior year period our global mortgage insurance businesses continue to drive our overall operating performance with strong growth in our u s business in u s mi first quarter adjusted operating income increased 12 year over year to 124 million driven primarily by strong premium growth from higher insurance in force and favorable loss performance in the quarter u s mi generated 9 6 billion in new insurance written or niw as a result of its continued ability to maintain and grow share in the u s market u s mi s capital position remains strong ending the quarter with over 600 million in capital above the revised pmiers requirements which became effective on march 31st in canada adjusted operating income for the first quarter declined 10 year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange to 41 million on lower earned premium and an increase in expenses canada s capital ratio remains well above requirements and our management targets in australia adjusted operating income for the first quarter declined 26 year over year excluding the impact of foreign exchange to 14 million primarily driven by lower premiums due to portfolio seasoning our life insurance segment recorded an operating loss of 5 million flat with first quarter of 2018 higher ltc premiums and benefit reductions as a result of our in force rate actions as well as strong equity market performance and lower mortality in our life insurance products were offset by higher new ltc claims severity and frequency results were also impact by less favorable ltc claim terminations year over year advertisement advertisement achieving actuarially justified premium rate increases and benefit reductions through our ltc rate action plan remains a high strategic priority for genworth these annual ltc premium increases which are intended to address our higher claims experience provides significant leverage to genworth s cash flow as the higher premiums are expected to be paid over decades into the future as shown on slide 10 we received 24 state approvals in the first quarter impacting 241 million of in force premiums with an average annual premium increase of 62 from 2012 through the first quarter of 2019 genworth has achieved approximately 11 billion of approved ltc premium rate increases on an at present value basis let me now turn to the review of the progress made toward completing the oceanwide transaction as previously announced genworth and oceanwide have received all necessary approvals from our u s state insurance regulators fannie mae freddie mac and certain other international jurisdictions oceanwide needs to receive clearance in china for the currency conversion and transfer of funds and they re actively engaged with the relevant chinese regulators over the last several months we have focused our efforts toward obtaining approval from the canadian regulatory authorities our discussion with canadian regulators has been centered around national security matters including data protection and safeguarding our customers personally identifiable information these are important complex issues for which we have significant experience given our success in the design and implementation of the enhanced data security program in connection with the cfius clearance earlier this year we proposed a mitigation approach to canada similar to what was agreed to with cfius we have met with the canadian regulators in person several times to answer their questions and we have provided them with additional information regarding our proposed mitigation we last met with them in the first part of february at that time the canadian regulators informed us that they had the information that they needed to complete their review since then the canadian regulators have been reviewing the matter and we have not received any additional information requests or questions however they have not outlined a time frame for the completion of their review of the transaction advertisement advertisement to allow additional time for canada s ongoing review genworth and oceanwide announced earlier this week that the parties have agreed to extend the merger agreement from april 30 2019 to june 20 2019 we believe this should provide adequate time for canada to finish their review genworth and oceanwide continue to be actively engaged with other relevant regulators and authorities who have already approved the transaction we believe these parties continue to fully support the transaction i want to thank all the regulators and reviewers of the transaction and all of genworth s and oceanwide s stakeholders for their considerable patience as we work through the final phase of the transaction we recognize that it s been a long and complex process we have received a number of questions from investors analysts regulators and rating agencies regarding oceanwide s and genworth s plans for the 1 5 billion oceanwide post closing capital plan and the 175 million capital commitment to genworth life insurance company or glic from genworth holdings originally the first tranche the 1 5 billion oceanwide capital plan and the first tranche of the 175 million glic contribution were scheduled to be made by march 31st 2019 it is the intention of oceanwide and genworth to address the data of the various tranches in light of the later closing date of the transaction recognizing the important of funding the 1 5 billion oceanwide capital commitment comfortable ahead of the debt maturities in 2020 and 2021 we appreciate the cooperation of all regulators in these discussions finally i want to reaffirm that the genworth board continues to believe the oceanwide transaction represents the best and most certain value to our shareholders genworth and oceanwide remain fully committed to the transaction and we continue to work together to close the transaction as soon as possible at the same time genworth continues to execute against its strategic priorities and improve genworth s overall positioning our most important priorities are to grow earnings to build capital in our mortgage businesses and to strengthen our u s life business through our ltc rate action plan now i will turn the call over to kelly kelly groh chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks tom and good morning everyone today i will cover more detail on our first quarter financial results and key drivers capital levels in our businesses and updates around cash and flexibility at our holding company as the transaction with oceanwide has extended let s begin with this quarter s financial performance we reported net income for the quarter of 174 million and an adjusted operating income of 121 million our mortgage insurance businesses continue to perform well with strong loss ratio performance in the u s and canada and solid capital levels in all the mortgage insurance businesses our u s life and runoff business results were improved collectively with good in force rate action results term life mortality experience and equity market performance our strong results in our mortgage insurance businesses continue to reflect an overall solid macroeconomic environment including steady economic growth low unemployment and interest rate levels and stable housing trends in most markets and at home price levels where we generally provide mortgage insurance coverage our very strong adjusted operating income of 124 million in our u s mortgage insurance business reflected an 8 first quarter reported loss ratio compared to 7 last quarter new delinquencies for the quarter were down modestly on a sequential basis reflecting seasonality we also saw favorable net cures in aging overall insurance in force and u s mi continues to grow reaching an all time high of 170 billion at the end of first quarter 2019 this was up 10 versus last year and reflects strong levels of new insurance written as well as good persistency trends the u s purchase origination market was down versus the prior quarter from seasonality and flat versus the prior year our new insurance written or niw for the quarter was 9 6 billion up 3 sequentially and 7 versus the prior year we expect our u s mi first quarter 2019 estimated market share to increase sequentially we have selectively participated in forward commitment transactions and have continued to successfully role out our proprietary risk based pricing engine genrate and have seen good adoption we continue to manage to an overall return expectation in the mid teens on the 2019 book year new insurance written advertisement advertisement turning to canada the loss ratio of 15 represents a decrease of three points from the prior quarter on lower average reserves on delinquencies primarily in alberta and the atlantic region and an increase of two points from the prior year on higher new delinquencies net of cures canada s targeted loss ratio for 2019 is 15 25 and the first quarter s performance and expectations for the remainder of the year are in line with those expectations flow niw in canada decreased 33 sequentially from a seasonally smaller origination market and 8 versus the prior year primarily from lower originations resulting from ongoing affordability pressure in larger canadian cities moving to australia the u s gap loss ratio in the quarter was 34 up five points versus the prior quarter from seasonally higher new delinquencies net of cures and up four points versus the prior year mostly from lower earned premiums in the current quarter on australia s ifrs accounting basis the quarterly loss ratio of 55 for the first quarter of 2019 was in line with the full year loss ratio expectations of 45 55 considering the seasonal pattern of higher delinquencies traditionally experienced in the first half of the year our flow new business levels in australia were down 15 versus the prior quarter from a seasonally smaller origination market and up 9 versus the prior year primarily from higher mortgage origination activity from certain lender customers as i mentioned our first quarter results in our u s life segment plus runoff were driven by good in force rate action results in long term care term life mortality experience and equity market performance these results were partially offset by a couple of distinct items i will go through in long term care claim terminations were sequentially higher in the first quarter which is generally consistent with seasonal patterns as we tend to see higher terminations in the first half of the year and lower terminations in the second half of the year compared to last year claim terminations were less favorable although still within our range of expectations new claims following updated utilization assumptions from the fourth quarter of 2018 did reflect higher severity versus prior periods that we expect will continue we did see an incurred but not reported or ibnr benefit during the quarter which offset the incremental new claim expense versus the prior quarter advertisement advertisement the overall financial benefits of in force rate actions for ltc were better sequentially and versus the prior year as illustrated on page 10 of the investor deck released this morning i do want to spend a minute discussing the ltc rate actions and their impact to our financials we continue to see very good results of our multiyear in force rate action plan and most regulators have been approving actuarily justified rate action requests these approval amounts have been in line with assumptions used in our margin testing and this will continue to be a focus of ours based on last year s margin testing we estimated the need for approximately 6 billion on a net present value basis in anticipated future approved rate actions under actuarial assumptions that were updated in late 2018 our first quarter approvals from a couple large states on a net present value basis were approximately 500 million of the 6 billion remaining as of year end 2018 our multiyear rate action plan assumes it will take approximately 10 years to obtain and implement these remaining approvals and considers the timing and phase in implementation on rate actions previously approved to date for statutory accounting we have recognized ltc claim reserve increases immediately in the quarter we updated assumptions this creates a timing mismatch between the reserve increases and the offsetting implementation of actuarily justified rate actions therefore we may see variability in statutory results and declining risk based capital ratios given the time lag until the premium increase benefits are fully realized and reflected in the financials we plan on continuing to discuss this timing mismatch with our insurance regulators and if in the future any claims reserve strengthening is required based on experience we may seek to better match future premium income benefits with reserve increases for statutory accounting purposes advertisement advertisement turning to life insurance mortality and term life was lower than both last quarter and last year due primarily to lower claim severity higher variable investment and limited partnership income also drove improved results versus last quarter and last year results in the quarter also included actuarial model updates in universal life totaling 11 million after tax which primarily increased the amortization of deferred acquisition costs while mortality and term life was lower this quarter we have seen mortality for ul trend higher than our prices for assumptions over the last several years i also wanna point out that the term life business continues to be impacted from higher lapses primarily associated with the large 15 year and 20 year level premium term life insurance blocks entering their post level premium periods which result in lower premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs upon lapse given the locked in assumptions under currenting accounting standards we expect this trend to accelerate in 2019 as a larger block of 20 year level premium term business written in 1999 reaches the end of its level premium period in our fixed annuity products we saw favorable mortality versus the prior quarter and prior year results in the quarter also reflected a sequential reduction to reserves associated with fixed indexed annuities driven by the equity market improvement in the quarter this was more than offset by an after tax loss recognition charge of 13 million related to single premium mediated annuities mainly from lower interest rates and turnover in the supporting investment portfolio our loss in the corporate and other segment of 73 million for the quarter was higher than the prior period mainly due to a 12 million expense related to the global and tangible low taxed income or the acronym gilti which i will refer to as gilti provision of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act we have calculated the gilti expense based on our interpretations of the current rules however these interpretations may change as further guidance is issued on this new area of tax law gilti has an impact on our effective tax rate due to the interaction between foreign tax credit carry forward rules utilization of u s net operating loss carry forwards and projected taxable losses in the u s life business the impact to the effective rate is expected to continue through 2020 but is projected to be reduced in future years assuming we return to having positive taxable income after utilizing net operating losses in our u s businesses we do not expect gilti to result in significant cash taxed payments in 2019 or future years we also recorded 13 million additional tax expense in the corporate and other segment driven by the level of capital gains recognized during the quarter the interim financial reporting requirements of apb 28 attempts to smooth your overall tax rate on net income by quarter this timing difference will reverse by the end of the year now i ll move to capital levels where our mortgage insurance businesses continue to maintain very strong capital positions in u s mi we finished the quarter with a pmiers sufficiency ratio of 123 or an excess of more than 600 million above the required assets note this does reflect the revised private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements which were finalized late last year by the federal housing finance agency fhfa and effective for first quarter 2019 reporting in our canada mi business we saw an estimated mortgage insurer capital adequacy test or micat ratio which is the new standard of 172 in the quarter which continues to remain well above the company s operating target range of 160 165 late last year the canadian office of the superintendent of financial institutions or osfi finalized updates to the capital guidelines for mortgage insurers which became effective january 1st 2019 these updates had no significant impact on our reported capital ratio while canada did not execute any extraordinary capital deployment activities during the quarter beyond their ordinary dividends their expectations for 2019 extraordinary capital redeployment are between canadian 400 million and 500 million dollars at current foreign exchange rates that range translates to approximately 120 165 million u s dollars to our holding company and approximately 50 65 million to u s mi our australia mi business ended the quarter with an estimated capital ratio of 201 up from 194 last quarter which is approximately 500 million australian dollars above the high end of the prescribed capital amount or pca management target range of 132 144 the increase in australia s capital ratio reflected continued portfolio seasoning and in force profitability offset by australia s biannual ordinary dividend payment and execution of a portion of their share repurchase initiative of 100 million australian dollars which was announced last quarter capital optimization remains a focus for the business given its excess capital position in fact australia has recently announced that a resolution will be put to shareholders at the company s annual general meeting in may to consider and approve future possibly buybacks of up to 100 million shares over the next 12 month period the genworth holding company received a total of 47 million in net dividends and proceeds from repurchases from our international mortgage insurance subsidiaries during the quarter including 14 million of share buyback proceeds from canada which were held at an intermediate holding company at year end capital in genworth life insurance company or glic ended the first quarter at approximately 195 of company action level rbc this ratio reflects combined statutory profits in our non ltc products offset by ongoing statutory losses and claims growth in ltc as i discussed the benefits of the entire multiyear rate action plan will be implemented over time which will help offset some of the ltc claims pressure given that we ve received a number of questions from investors trying to understand rbc i wanted to take a moment now to clarify a few points when tom or i discuss rbc we generally discuss it in a context of a percentage of required assets on a company action level basis or the point at which a company would need to file a plan of action for improvement with its domiciliary regulator this basis reflects required assets that are twice the authorized control level amounts which is the basis used primarily for regulatory compliance purposes said another way our rbc for glic of approximately 195 on a company action level basis is the same as approximately 390 on an authorized control level basis the minimum level before a plan of action must be filed with a regulator is two times acl required assets or in other words 100 of the company action level risk based capital or three times acl required assets or 150 company action level rbc if the negative trend test rules apply the negative trend test looks at historical loss levels and whether those loss levels would breach certain rbc thresholds none of our companies have breached these levels i also wanna remind investors that as a part of our earlier agreement with delaware regarding the oceanwide transaction genworth will contribute to glic 175 million with the timing of the first tranche consistent with the closing date of the transaction and remaining tranches to be agreed upon with the relevant regulators the contribution to glic is a special one time commitment made in conjunction with the proposed transaction with oceanwide as we have indicated previously it is our intention to manage the u s life entities on a stand alone basis with no future plans to infuse capital in these businesses the u s life businesses will rely on their consolidated statutory capital of approximately 1 9 billion prudent management of in force blocks and the actuarily justified rate actions to satisfy policyholder obligations moving to the holding company we ended the quarter with slightly over 400 million in cash and liquid assets as compared to just over 500 million last quarter our current cash level is approximately 100 million below our targeted two times forward debt service buffer during the quarter total net dividends and proceeds from share repurchases to the holding company were 47 million intercompany tax payments of 30 million were also a source to the holding company during the first quarter offsetting this were interest payments of 71 million that are higher in the first and third quarters given the timing of semiannual interest payments we posted additional cash collateral of 22 million primarily on our hybrid debt interest rate swaps as rates moved lower during the quarter we also had 83 million in other items which included certain employee benefit expenses that trend higher in the first quarter and are mostly replenished by the businesses throughout the remaining quarters of the year we continue to discuss the timing of the 1 5 billion capital plan with oceanwide and our regulators in light of the delay of closing the transaction and we are mindful of the upcoming holding company obligations in addition to approximately 400 million in unsecured debt maturing in june of 20 other near term holding company obligations include the 175 million contribution to glic and the 200 million intercompany note due in march of 2020 the capital commitment from oceanwide along with the existing holding company cash and dividends from our well capitalized mortgage insurance subsidiaries will be key to addressing these items to sum things up for the quarter we remain focused on the operational process including our ltc rate action plan and other strategic actions intended to improve and help stabilize our u s life insurance businesses our mortgage insurance businesses continue to execute on their priorities and are performing very well with solid earnings and strong capital levels with that let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the q a portion of the call as a reminder please refrain from using cellphones speakerphones or headsets press 1 to ask a question if at any time your question has already been answered or you would like to withdraw your question please press 2 to be removed please press 1 now to ask a question our first question comes from ryan krueger from kbw please go ahead ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research hi good morning first on canada can you just talk about when the canadian review started and have you had any contact with them since you met in early february tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thanks for the question ryan i mean obviously we originally filed with canada shortly after we signed the deal so we signed in october of 2016 and i think we did the form a filing there end of the year in 2016 of course there have been changes to the deal along the way we refiled with the contingency plan capital plan from oceanwide there were some changes by delaware there was a cfius update so you could look at it from their perspective that the deal has changed along the way so i think they and we started more significant discussions in january one of the advantages we have is we spent significant time with cfius and it s also like in canada a complex mitigation plan that has a lot of different pieces to it and so we had discussions with them several meetings as i mentioned the last was early february what my understanding is is they have said they have all the information they need unfortunately they haven t really given us a time frame for when they ll finish the review and there are several different agencies that are reviewing the mitigation plan and the filing overall ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research thanks and then the second question was within any of the regulatory approvals or the merger agreement can you just remind us are there any requirements in terms of specifics toward china oceanwide s financial conditions and are they required to hold any sort of assets in any escrow accounts tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer no there are none of those requirements clearly as time goes on and we have year end 2018 financials and i m sure those when they re finished by china oceanwide they will be submitted to all the regulators virginia is our lead regulator and they re coordinating with all the other regulators and with us obviously they re here based in richmond where we are so it s very convenient for us to have all those discussions virginia s been very supportive of the transaction they ve of course approved it and so in addition to our work with our teams with all of the regulators keeping them all up to date virginia is also coordinating from an overall regulatory perspective but there are no specific requirements obviously the regulators until the deal closes they ll continue to review anything that s new and new information that s sort of the normal course ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research i guess this is more of a question about china oceanwide but do they have i guess liquid assets currently in excess of the purchase price tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer so ryan in the delaware hearing a significant part of the focus of the hearing was on china oceanwide financial resources and so as part of the filings with all the regulators plus as updated by the china oceanwide representatives they went through all that we obviously have been doing our own due diligence and so they have significant financial assets and cash one of the challenges that we still have is ultimately once we wrap up with canada is the chinese regulators will have to decide how much of the purchase price can come from the assets that china oceanwide has in mainland china versus offshore and as you ll recall along the way a year or so ago i think we worked on a contingent plan so i think both china oceanwide and genworth have worked on a plan so that we feel very comfortable regardless of how safe comes out in terms of the conversion of the currency and the funding we have both our original plan which had all of the proceeds coming from the excess assets and excess cash in china but we also have a contingency plan if the regulators in china put a limit on that so we feel very comfortable both oceanwide and genworth that there are assets both within china and outside that are more than adequate to fund the transactions and also to fund the 1 5 billion capital plan ryan krueger kbw managing director equity research thank you operator as a reminder please press 1 to ask a question the next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore please go ahead tom gallagher evercore senior managing director good morning kelly your comment on rbc potentially going down just given the lag between the rate approvals and the benefits there versus a more immediate potential strengthening of gross long term care reserves based on what you re seeing right now would you anticipate a meaningful impact to rbc and i guess if it is is there a contingency plan like do you think you d be able to file for permitted practice particularly if you think the regulators see that it s just truly just a timing issue kelly groh chief financial officer thanks for the question tom and good morning i think it s a great question we continually look at our risk based capital forecast and our operating plans over a multiyear time horizon permitted practices similar to what ge had done on their very large increase are certain things that we would consider to talk to the regulators over time it depends on the facts and circumstances that we run into at that period of time but as you saw even the first quarter we started putting up higher average claims and it will take time to file and then implement the rate actions associated with those higher claim levels now regarding our forecast right now we don t have a forecast that shows us going into a scenario where it would require us to submit a plan of action with our regulators so it is a discussion we would continue to have with our regulators but our forecast currently does not show that tom gallagher evercore senior managing director thanks and then just on that same topic can you talk a bit about what kind of change there was percentage terms was it a meaningful increase in both severity and frequency in terms of the long term care claims i think if i look back to your 2018 filing frequency didn t change too much severity was up in the teens can you quantify at all what kind of trend change you saw on the first quarter kelly groh chief financial officer tom i don t have that in front of me right now we d be happy to evaluate whether or not there s some meaningful information that investors could gain from that and figure out what level of granularity we can also look at if there s anything in our 10 q that would be adequate when we file that so we ll have to get back to you on that one tom gallagher evercore senior managing director great and then just as it relates to the rate increases you ve clearly been having more success there if you look at 17 it was a little less than 30 45 in 2018 and now to start the year you re at 60 rate increase weighted average can you talk a little bit about what s going on with the state are we seeing that level because some of the bottlenecks or states that weren t granting rate increases are now coming through or are you actually seeing just higher across the board rate increases occurring and where would you expect that trend to go tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer so tom that s a great question and it s a complex question because every state in the district of columbia so 51 jurisdictions does it somewhat differently i do think from if you look back over the last five or six years 2013 14 i think it was difficult receiving the large increases triple digit type increases from any of the states i think that has changed i think over the last five or six years genworth and all of the other long term care insurers with legacy blocks have provided a lot of information to the regulators and so i would say all regulators recognize that there are significant needs for actuarily justified premium increases i would say generally there has been 40 45 states who are doing significantly well from our perspective and i think other insurers perspective and really stepping up and giving significant premium increases on some policy forums we re over 200 cumulative increases and i think we ve said in the past that the most problematic legacy policies are those that have unlimited number of years of coverage and 5 compound inflation protection and that we need 300 type increases and so if you look at our cumulative net present value of 11 billion now at the end of the first quarter versus our original target that has grown but it s that 16 5 billion we re around two thirds and if you look at the average from those 40 45 states we re in pretty good shape there are some states that are behind and so i do believe that one of the challenges in the industry and among the 50 states is there are some states that are very far along in giving very significant premium increases to genworth and to other companies and then there are other states that are well behind and i do think there is pressure coming from the majority of states against those few states that are behind and so i do think you will see and in some cases your hypothesis was right that some of the large increases that we ve received lately have come from states that have a ways to catch up and i think ultimately all the regulators in the naic i think really have to in my perspective figure out a more consistent basis for granting premium increases now that i think there s no question that these increases are needed and are actuarily justified but we don t have homogeneity across all the states in terms of how they do it everyone is somewhat different and so i do think more and more states that are in pretty good shape along the way they have more to do but they really i think have done a great job in terms of managing this and i think they need to put some pressure on their fellow regulators and commissioners to step up more and so hopefully we ll see that tom gallagher evercore senior managing director that s helpful thanks tom operator once again please press 1 to ask a question the next question comes from jimmy bhullar from jp morgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar jp morgan equity research analyst hi good morning i joined the call late so i don t know if you ve covered this topic but can you sort of talk about if there s a possibility that if the merger approval process continues or the acquisition approval process continues to get delayed is there a point at which you might need to go and reseek the approvals that you ve already obtained so is there an expiration date or is there a way for the regulators to sort of ask you to restart the process beyond a certain point tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer jimmy that s a good question there have been questions before you joined on a deal progress b but that specific question hasn t come up what i would say is that we have a lead regulator virginia that has approved the deal and it s coordinating with all the regulators and we have a specific team led by our general counsel ward bobitz who s focused discussions with all the regulators so i think we really kept all the regulators up to speed i think the regulators that have approved the deal remain very supportive of the transaction obviously we will update them along the way obviously each quarter we have financial statements that we release so we provide those and then my expectation would be that some of the public companies that filed 2018 sometime in may those financials become available and i think we ll submit those but i do not see any of the other regulators who ve already approved undoing their approval if you will i think they ll continue to want to see new information just with the passage of time and i think the focus now really is on canada and we discussed that on a previous question but we ve learned in the cfius process that it takes time to go through these mitigations plans it s not something that any of these regulators including canada have brought experience in so it s new we were fortunate in the case of canada that we had a very good model in cfius i think that was a very strong mitigation plan so that s the basis that we ve used we ve gone back and forth with canada what i said on the call earlier is the last meeting we had with them was in early february at that time they told us that they had the information they needed to review the transaction obviously we extended again to june 30 and we think that should be enough time for them to finish their process and it s really canada that s left and i think the other regulators that have already approved are still very supportive of the deal jimmy bhullar jp morgan equity research analyst and then can you share any insight that you have on oceanwide s financing for the transaction i don t think there s an escrow account that the money s sitting in but do you have any views on how they re gonna finance it tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer so that question did come up before and it s a good question so in the process both genworth and all the regulators have done due diligence on china oceanwide and the funding and there is significant excess cash and capital within mainland china that china oceanwide has as you know because you and i have talked about this before several months ago maybe even a year ago we did come up with a contingency plan to the extent that safe ultimately limits the amount of currency conversion within mainland china oceanwide does have a contingency plan that has cash and other capital as well as financing outside of china so we believe that whether the deal is funded primarily from china or outside under the contingency plan that oceanwide is in very good shape in terms of being prepared once we get the final approvals from canada to move forward and close the deal and that they have adequate cash and capital to not only provide the purchase price of 2 7 billion but also the 1 5 billion capital that s due over time post to closing jimmy bhullar jp morgan equity research analyst thank you good luck tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thank you jimmy operator the next question comes from alex scott from goldman sachs please go ahead alex scott goldman sachs equity research analyst hi i just had a quick one on long term care i know the regulators had some i guess enhanced disclosure on the actuarial guidance 51 that was issued for year end 18 and i d just be interested in any feedback you got through that process i think there was a focus on morbidity assumptions and more specifically incidence curves so i d be interested if you got any color in terms of how some of those assumptions compare to the industry through that process kelly groh chief financial officer thanks for the question alex i think those conversations are ongoing all the carriers just recently submitted their cash flow testing memorandum and i think the regulators are methodically looking through all of that and having discussions we feel like we re very compliant with actuarial guideline 51 and that all of our methods are very supportable based on our experience and with appropriate provisions for adverse deviation alex scott goldman sachs equity research analyst all right thank you operator as there are no further questions signaled i will now return the call back to your host mr mcinerney tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thank you very much klina and thanks to all of you for your time and questions today we appreciate your continued investment and interest in genworth and we recognize that the oceanwide transactions approval process has been very frustrating and it s obviously taken longer than any of us expected but please be assured that oceanwide and genworth are working very hard to close the transaction as soon as possible and thank you very much for being on the call this morning operator that will conclude today s call thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen you may now disconnect

the ftse 100 lost ground yesterday on the back of disappointing manufacturing reports from china â when the chinese economy grew by more than expected in the first quarter there was a belief in some

by jeffrey frankel one of us president donald trump s two intended nominees to fill vacancies on the us federal reserve board of governors herman cain has now withdrawn trump s other potential pick stephen moore is also under an ethical cloud and often gets his economic facts wrong by contrast trump s earlier appointments to the fed have been sound choices in particular jerome powell the current chair although moore lacks an economics phd that is not a reason to oppose him fed appointees have long included people with business experience powell for example does not have one either the big worry however is that moore would be a trump crony who does whatever the president wants rather than what is best for the economy moreover moore s views on the fed s interest rate policy and his support for returning america to a gold or commodity standard are disturbing moore has favoured pro cyclical monetary policy opposing stimulus when the economy needed it and favouring stimulus when it was not required when the fed sought to boost the us economy in response to the 2007 2009 recession moore initially raised the spectre of hyperinflation and continued to warn of rising inflation in 2010 even when unemployment exceeded 9 needless to say the bogeyman never showed up employment then rose steadily over the following eight years presumably increasing the risks of the us economy overheating yet moore switched coats and attacked the fed for excessively high interest rates in december he even suggested that trump should fire powell for tightening monetary policy one is tempted to ask moore if he turns on the air conditioning at home in winter and the heat in summer the most plausible explanation for his change of course is that he started favouring stimulus when trump took office had the fed followed moore s advice it would have tightened monetary policy in 2010 prolonging the recession and loosened policy in 2018 when unemployment was already below 4 this would have destabilised the economy moore s shift is part of a more general republican swing in favour of monetary easing trump himself made the same switch in the direction of his attacks on the fed from 2011 to 2018 some media have portrayed this as a departure from decades of anti inflation hawkishness in fact republican administrations have been pressuring the fed to ease monetary policy for half a century in the early 1970s president richard nixon successfully pushed fed chair arthur burns to loosen monetary policy excessively leading to high inflation that the administration then tried to suppress with wage and price controls nixon also broke the dollar s link with gold in 1971 and devalued the currency ending the bretton woods era of monetary stability in a similar vein republican presidents ronald reagan and george hw bush leant aggressively on fed chairs paul volcker and alan greenspan to ease monetary policy especially in election years as bob woodward documented in his book maestro by contrast all three democratic presidents during the past 50 years refrained from pushing the fed toward a more dovish stance president jimmy carter appointed volcker as fed chair in 1979 with a mandate to conquer inflation even at the cost of a recession that reduced carter s chances of re election the following year and presidents bill clinton and barack obama scrupulously avoided commenting on us monetary policy thereby reinforcing the norm of fed independence in addition to his pronouncements on interest rate policy moore has repeatedly said in the past that he supports a currency regime under which the dollar would be convertible into a fixed amount of gold in true trumpian fashion moore recently denied having advocated this despite clear video evidence to the contrary he now says he favours a monetary policy that focuses on a basket of commodities and not only gold although this suggestion has drawn criticism a price index based on a variety of commodities would at least make the economy less vulnerable to the volatile gold market after president franklin d roosevelt took america off the gold standard in the 1930s for example two leading economists benjamin graham and john maynard keynes discussed the merits of a hypothetical commodity basket standard in the late 1970s those who hitched themselves to reagan s 1980 presidential campaign and famously called for large tax cuts which they said would pay for themselves also tended to believe that america should consider returning to the gold standard representative jack kemp and others continued to campaign for a return to gold in the 1980s arguing that the fed would then be able to ease its tight monetary policy which they thought was the only thing that had prevented their supply side revolution from succeeding as some pointed out the rise of a small government populist arguing in favour of the gold standard turned the history of american populism on its head during the deflationary 1890s democrat william jennings bryan had campaigned for the presidency by memorably declaring that farmers and workers would refuse to be crucified on a cross of gold for him an easier monetary policy required abandoning the gold standard on this issue bryan was ahead of his time it would make no more sense to go back to the gold standard than to heating all our homes with coal in recent times the fed has shown that it can fight to achieve monetary stability more effectively on its own so long as it has competent appointees and institutional independence the us senate should keep that in mind if and when it considers moore s nomination
victoria ngozi ikeano recently the international monetary fund imf warned nigeria and other african countries to beware of loans from china one cannot really pinpoint the purport of this advice i can only say that it is rather too late in the day as china is already entrenching itself in nigeria nay africa as a gargantuan economic ally in these times according to a chinese maxim a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step although one cannot quite decipher when the first step was taken the reality is that china with slow and steady pace is taking over our landscapes offices and households take a look at the labels of most of the modern day electronic gadgets we flaunt in our homes offices etc you will discover that most of them in one way or other are coming from china or adjoining countries of indonesia thailand malaysia korea the asian tigers they are called japan is supposed to be our most influential trading partner in that region since they have been interacting with us long before china stepped into the scene products from japan together with those from our erstwhile colonial master united kingdom uk are tagged original in the nigerian parlance but alas today the so called made in japan and made in england goods are hard to come by where you manage to find them their prices are way above the roof so that only the nouveaux rich can afford them this is where the asians led by the chinese have come in to fill a gulf in our market segmentation by flooding our country with relatively cheaper products and so it is that our businessmen are turning their gaze more and more to china indonesia et al that is why many more of our imports are coming from that part of the world our governments both state and federal are also forging greater ties with china resulting into a marriage of sort no investment drive by our governments is complete without the chinese playing a big role and china s leader is stepping out boldly into the world to forge new strategic partnerships resulting in china africa summits our various governments are awarding contracts or entering into partnerships with china for revamping or building of new projects in critical sectors as energy transportation agriculture and infrastructure generally the bottom line is that china is wooing us into its arms twenty first century kids are in love with play station and noodles which has its origins in that part of the world noodles is a food delicacy that was hitherto unknown in the dictionary of older generations but which is fast gaining ground among all strata of society save the most fastidious there is also the chinese driven herbal medicine and electro magnetic therapies that are fast gaining ground world wide among all generations including nigerians especially the middle and upper classes seeking for the secrets of longevity and everlasting youth trade between nigeria and china has been rising geometrically since beginning of this decade indeed statistics show that nigeria s most important import partners in 2018 were china which accounted for 31 5 per cent of all imports india 8 1 per cent germany 4 7 per cent uk 3 8 per cent netherlands 2 6 per cent france 2 2 per cent and south africa 1 2 per cent last year nigeria s central bank signed a currency swap deal with its chinese counterpart thereby making the yuan an alternative to the us dollar what perhaps remains to complete their rising profile in nigeria is for us to be able to speak their tongue twisting language as fluently as the english language our lingua franca already one of our universities has instituted a programme for the teaching of chinese language while china itself in conjunction with the kano state government is establishing a school for the modern standard chinese language mandarin that day may not be far off when the chinese language would be as widely spoken in nigeria too but how did china come to strut about our industrial landscape like a colossus such that most industrial and household products in one way or other carry the signature made in china fabricated in china while made in japan and made in uk brands are now endangered species of sort in our clime how did the reversal set in is it that as we grew older as a nation nigeria began to gradually cut the umbilical cord that tied it to its western allies and began to court the hand of new friends as an adult or is it that as the country grew older it began to have a longing to see and taste other parts of the world in truth it was a combination of social and economic factors as our economy slumped our exchange rate in relation to other major world currencies notably the british pound and us dollars nose dived thereby making prices of goods imported from these countries way out of reach of the average nigerian our businessmen and importers then turned to asia china which is offering cheaper alternatives china itself embarked on what can be called social engineering it came out of its communist cocoon to embrace the world china s president xi jipeng had been visiting developed and developing countries to sign bilateral and regional cooperation agreements to open up china to the world china has been hosting notable world conferences a testimony of its social standing globally with a population of over one billion people the largest in the world neither industrialised nor emerging economies like ours can afford to ignore it remarkably too china embarked on some kind of deliberate lobbying to woo african and developing countries it is noteworthy that china built the imposing african union au headquarters in addis ababa free of charge it has expanded its satellite cable television which is free to air the china global television cgtv cgtv now competes with both cnn america and bbc uk in the race to influence the world overall china is winning not just in nigeria but also globally with sure and steady steps from being the world s seventh largest economy with a gross domestic product gdp of 305 35 billion in 1980 china is now the second largest economy in our world with its gdp as at april 2018 put at 12 01 trillion it is second only to the united states which has a gdp of 19 39 trillion when you consider that the us has a population of just over 300 million and china over one billion people you would appreciate the phenomenal growth of the chinese economy as an economic superpower no wonder it is referred to as the world s factory ikeano writes from lafia

storm damaged over 400 poles in southern minnesota and northern iowa last month fortunately itc was able to restore service to its customers within a few days 2019 is off to a strong start we continue to see strong growth in our regulated utility businesses financially and operationally we ve made strides positioning us well to execute on our goals for the year financially adjusted eps was cad 0 74 for the quarter and was up cad 0 04 compared to the previous year reflecting 5 7 eps growth operationally in the quarter we invested cad 740 million at our utilities these investments enhance the service we provide to our customers with an eye on delivering cleaner energy in a safe reliable and affordable manner we remain on track to invest cad 3 7 billion in 2019 and approximately cad 17 billion over the next five years in arizona tucson electric power or tep filed a rate case on april 1st using a 2018 historical test year tep is seeking to recover its investments made since its last rate case supporting customers in the transition to a cleaner energy future including expansion of its wind solar and natural gas generation resources earlier this year we announced that we had entered into an agreement with columbia power corporation and columbia basin trust to sell our 51 interest in the waneta expansion for approximately cad 1 billion during the quarter we progressed through the sale process and we successfully closed the transaction on april 16 lastly in conjunction with the waneta expansion sale we successfully settled a tender offer to repurchase us 400 million of the corporation s outstanding notes due to 2026 at fortis we are committed to reducing our environmental footprint during the quarter three significant milestones were achieved to support this commitment in march tep finalized its plans for construction of the us 370 million oso grande wind project construction of the 247 megawatt wind farm is expected to commence later this year and be online by the end of next year once completed it will become tep s largest renewable energy resource and generate enough power to supply nearly 100 000 homes this project is expected to increase tep s renewable energy production to approximately 28 in 2021 well ahead of the existing state renewable goal of 15 by 2025 and bringing the utility close to a 30 goal planned to be achieved by 2030 although we expect to meet our target well ahead of 2030 we are not stopping there we will continue to pursue new initiatives to support the shift to a lower carbon economy for our customers and we expect to be able to grow beyond the 30 previously targeted for 2030 turning to british columbia fortisbc announced a significant increase it its energy conservation and efficiency program over the next four years the nearly cad 370 million program will be focused on customer initiatives to lower energy use emissions and reduced energy bills these expenditures will increase fortisbc s rate base over the four years these conservation and efficiency enhancements are expected to decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 50 000 tons annually which equates to taking close to 11 000 gasoline powered cars off the road a significant milestone was achieved in the wataynikaneyap power project last month when the leave to construct was obtained from the ontario energy board remaining milestones include finalization of environmental approvals which are expected to be received later this year the project is targeted to be completed in 2023 and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the diesel generation currently used by the communities we are confident in our ability to deliver on our cad 17 3 billion capital plan for the period 2019 2023 99 of our planned capital investments are in our regulated businesses the plan consists of a diverse mix of highly executable low risk projects needed to maintain an upgrade our existing infrastructure this capital plan supports our 6 7 average annual rate based growth and translates to over cad 35 billion in rate base in 2023 we remain optimistic in our ability to grow our portfolio of utility businesses our 45 years of dividend increases makes us a leader in dividend growth our strong growth profile coupled with our highly regulated businesses gives us confidence that we will continue this record and grow the dividend at an average annual growth rate of 6 through 2023 i ll now turn the call over to jocelyn for an update on our first quarter results jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer thank you barry and good morning everyone for the first quarter reported eps of cad 0 72 was cad 0 05 lower than last year this was largely due to a one time cad 30 million positive us tax adjustment in 2018 related to our filing of a consolidated state income tax return excluding one time items adjusted eps of cad 0 74 for the quarter was up cad 0 04 compared to the previous year reflecting a 4 7 eps increase our utilities continued to execute on their capital plans with cad 740 million invested during the first quarter now turning to slide 10 i ll take a look at the eps growth on a segmented basis first strong performance at uns and central hudson resulted in a cad 0 03 eps increase during the quarter higher sales at uns energy as a result of colder temperatures and the new rate order at central hudson were the key drivers of this increase central hudson s results were also positive impacted by timing differences associated with the rate order and operating costs these increases were partially offset by planned outage costs at uns a higher us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate favorably impacted the quarter the average rate was cad 1 33 this quarter compared to cad 1 26 in the first quarter last year this increase resulted in a cad 0 02 eps increase itc contributed a cad 0 01 increase to eps during the quarter this was driven by rate based growth partially offset by the reduced roe independence incentive adder our canadian and caribbean utilities increased eps by cad 0 01 driven mainly by rate based growth and higher electricity sales at turks and caicos sales at turks and caicos last year were impacted by hurricane irma offsetting growth at our regulated utilities was a cad 0 02 eps decrease associated with our nonregulated energy infrastructure businesses realized margins were lower at aitken creek and lower rainfall decreased production in belize lastly there was a cad 0 01 eps decrease during the quarter due to a higher number of weighted average common shares as a result of our dividends reinvestment plan the funding plan outlined at investor day this past fall remains intact the majority of the funding required to execute the five year capital plan will come from cash flow our operating cash flows drip proceeds and debt financing at the regulated utilities the atm program remains available to provide additional financing flexibility as barry discussed our recent sale of the waneta hydro plant for approximately cad 1 billion completed the asset sale components of our current capital funding plan net proceeds were used to pay down corporate short term borrowings as well as repurchase a portion of the corporation s outstanding 3 055 note due in 2026 the repayment of holding company debt strengthens our balance sheet improve our credit metrics and further supports our investment grade credit ratings overall we are pleased with the waneta sale we estimate our gain to be approximately cad 415 million and this gain is expected to recognized in the second quarter turning to our 2019 regulatory outlook there was a fair amount of regulatory activity during the first quarter in march ferc issued two notices of inquiry which seek comment on its policies for determining the roe used in setting rates and how to improve its transmission incentive policies to appropriately encourage the development of needed infrastructure to the benefit of our customers itc views the process as an opportunity to demonstrate the value of the independent transmission model as well as advocate for the appropriate incentives to drive needed investments with respect to the roe inquiry ferc is providing an opportunity for all stakeholders beyond those currently involved in new england or miso transmission roe litigations to comment on the new roe methodology we don t expect this will materially impact the miso based roe complaint process and we anticipate that ferc will issue and order later this year fortisbc filed its multiyear rate plan in march as the current term expires at the end of this year the proposed plan seeks approval for a rate setting framework for 2020 through to 2024 cost of capital is not included in its filing and we anticipate a decision in 2020 as barry mentioned tucson electric power filed its rate case april 1st and turning to slide 13 we wanted to spend some time on this filing current rates at tep are based on a mid 2015 test year and do not include approximately us 700 million of rate based investments at the utility since rates were last set these investments were made to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers meet increasing demand and improve the sustainability of our generation portfolio including the integration of over 1 000 megawatts of renewable resources scheduled to be on tep s system by the end of 2020 additional requests include an roe increase of 60 basis points to 10 35 and an equity thickness increase to 53 this equates to a non fuel revenue increase of us 115 million or us 76 million net revenue increase after considering a reduction in fuel costs the reduction in fuel cost is driven by our migration to a cleaner and more balanced resource portfolio tep s proposal translates into an average residential customer bill increase of approximately us 7 61 per month over the past 10 years tep has seen its rate base grow from us 1 billion to us 2 7 billion while keeping average customer rate increases consistently below inflation each year we await a procedural schedule from the arizona corporations commission to determine the timing of proceedings this concludes my remarks i ll now turn the call back to barry barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you jocelyn fortis consists of well run utilities we are now 99 regulated and we are one of the most diversified utility businesses in north america looking ahead our growth profile is strong with over 7 rate based growth expected over the next three years and 6 rate based growth over the next five years this supports our 6 average annual dividend growth guidance to 2023 we continue to focus on growing our utility businesses to summarize through the first quarter the following accomplishments positions us well for the remainder of 2019 we closed the waneta expansion sale for approximately cad 1 billion improved our credit metric outlook by using the waneta proceeds to pay down corporate debt including the cad 400 million us repurchase of notes due in 2026 advanced the wataynikaneyap power project by obtaining the leave to construct from the oeb progressed our commitment to reduce our environmental footprint with the announcement of the oso grande wind project and the fortisbc energy conservation efficiency program filed rate cases at tep and fortisbc and delivered strong eps growth in the quarter i ll now turn the call back over to stephanie stephanie amaimo vice president investor relations thank you barry this concludes the presentation at this time we d like to open the call to address questions from the investment community questions and answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct a question and answer period if you would like to now register a question please press followed by the no 1 on your telephone if your question has been answered and you d like to withdraw your registration please press the sign if you are using a speakerphone please lift your handset before entering your request one moment please for the first question your first question comes from the line of robert kwan from rbc capital markets please go ahead robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst good morning maybe just barry v perry president chief executive officer good morning robert jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer good morning robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst morning maybe just to start with some of the opportunities that are potentially in front of you in bc and just wondering if there s an update on woodfibre lng and i guess generally just thoughts given the gas supply issues we had this past winter barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you robert for your question we continue to work with woodfibre they obviously have asked us to build a pipeline to sell them to get them some gas for their facility they re providing us some funds to do permitting procurement design of the pipeline so we continue to work with them on that and frankly i m probably anxious for them to make a final investment decisions but that s not yet been done so we re hopeful that will come soon and robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst i guess barry v perry president chief executive officer in terms of the i guess resilience and reliability of the gas network i m roger dall antonia is here our ceo of fortisbc he was a fellow that handled that crisis as a result of the enbridge pipeline rupture late last year did a great job for us so he s here for our annual meeting tomorrow and i ll let roger comment on that roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc thanks barry morning robert as far as woodfibre and the enbridge situation woodfibre holds their capacity and they haven t raised any issues with that so we don t see that as a concern and we are working with enbridge just generally on how we re addressing resiliency going forward robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay i guess just with that i m also wondering if woodfibre went ahead are there any discussions with the province or the bcuc and really upside i guess with strengthening whether that s actually getting something done additionally at tilbury or something around southern crossing roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc we re looking at both opportunities it s too early to discuss those plans in front of the bcuc and the government in the next little while as we look at both options robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst got it i can just finish with financing with the waneta divesture squaring up the funding plan i m just wondering what you might be thinking about though past that whether that s funding and making room for new assets or future step up in capital projects as it seems like there s a lot of things in front of you right now or even just streamlining the asset base barry v perry president chief executive officer robert maybe i ll wade in and jocelyn can follow up here but we ve been pretty clear that the cad 17 billion program required us to raise certain proceeds from asset sales and we ve now said the waneta transaction completes that we ve also been clear if our capital does go up that we have our atm program which s cad 500 million currently approved that we would turn that on and that would be we would that is our plan basically clearly if capex went well beyond levels that one could think about we would have to consider other opportunities to raise capital to be clear we are committed to our investment grade credit ratings we would do nothing that would harm those ratings robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst got it so that stands that atm is really the first option here barry v perry president chief executive officer that s correct robert kwan rbc capital markets analyst okay that s great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ben pham from bmo please go ahead ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay thanks good morning just going back to the waneta sale and you think what divestiture is does your holdco debts outlook that you highlighted at investor day is that are you well ahead of that spot that you presented or is it more of a gradual reduction jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so ben this is jocelyn so at investor day we actually had waneta included in our projections for holdco debt so i think we showed at investor day that holdco was going from 38 down to around 33 32 so we re on track with that plan with the close of the waneta sale ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay so the graphs are still in terms of the timing of waneta it s still more of a gradual reduction that jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yes ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst you bring forward the hold ok all right just wanted to check on that and then the on the just going back to some of the questions on future growth prospects there s a on some of the transmissions stuff in ontario there is a press release mentioning ontario capacity markets could drive your transmission initiatives can you comment a bit on that on why that could increase the probability of erie happening barry v perry president chief executive officer linda apsey s here with us from itc i would just comment obviously ben that we saw that developments in ontario were positive toward making projects like erie connector make more economic sense and we felt it would make some sense for us to come out in support of the initiatives that were occurring there the project still obviously does require a contract a long term contract for it to go ahead and we are not there on that at this point in time but overall the backdrop to some of the changes that are occurring in ontario are positive for the project linda apsey president chief executive officer itc holdings yeah absolutely good morning ben this is linda apsey yeah as barry mentioned certainly with the energy market capacity in market in pjm as well as obviously directional capacity interest in ontario obviously from a bc type project obviously we re trying to bring more attention to the benefits that can be created if you will both in terms of ontario through that transmission line just in the differentials that occurs in terms of capacity pricing in both those different markets so from our perspective capacity market was not something that ontario has i would say a lot of experience in and so bringing more attention to the benefits of a capacity market and the value of a project like the lake erie connector brings we re just really obviously trying to highlight that to continue to be part of the conversation and to continue to advance that project and highlighting the benefits and the need for the projects and continue to drive value for ontario customers ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay that s great and maybe to finish off some of the capex changes on the oso grande wind farm in arizona i m just more curious as the reiteration of the rate base at uns is that just because tax equity is going to pick up a greater share of that debt increase in capex that your rate base isn t changing barry v perry president chief executive officer i don t know if i understand your question ben i don t think that s part of it the are you referring to the cad 700 million rate based growth since the last historical test year in arizona ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst i was thinking more this was the higher megawatts on the oso grande wind farm it s going up by 200 million from previous disclosures and so it s cad 0 2 billion in capex and i m nitpicking a little bit on the numbers but is that you ve opted not to raise or change a rate base with that change so is it because the 200 million a big portion of those tax equity doesn t go to your rate base is that barry v perry president chief executive officer no that s not it ben ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst no okay barry v perry president chief executive officer we just obviously we weren t ready to update our overall program for the year a lot of projects in the cad 17 3 billion so i would say stay tuned for that but this is definitely an increased amount of capital but we haven t yet updated our overall program ben pham bmo capital markets corp analyst okay got it okay thanks everybody operator your next question comes from the line of nicholas campanella from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey congrats on the quarter good morning barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey just looking at the regulatory items i was just curious if you could provide a timeframe if you haven t already on when you think we ll have a resolution for the itc complaints as well as the notice of inquiry barry v perry president chief executive officer linda you want to provide your perspective you re the closest to it so linda apsey president chief executive officer itc holdings good morning nick i mean yeah certainly our view is particularly on the roe the pending roe base complaint we still believe we will see a decision on that yet this year in terms of the notice of inquiries i think those are a little less certain in terms of what ferc will do once they ve received all of the various comments and reply comments i think that s less clear as to what their next steps might be or what their timeline might be but i think clearly we feel as though we will continue to see a decision yet this year on the miso based roe complaints i think we ll have to just wait and see based on the comments and the ferc and the composition of ferc what they might do on those nois nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks i guess just shifting to arizona we all saw the hudbay mine and it sounds like that s going to be your largest customer in the jurisdiction is there any way to quantify how meaningful that is to your top line sales and then if you could just remind us how that reconciles with your longer term forecasts and then perhaps we can talk about incremental opportunities in arizona as well barry v perry president chief executive officer well nick all i can say is that arizona s a pretty big business and we re bringing on a new customer that s going to be our largest customer that s got to be positive right so david s here david do you want to add some other color david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations yeah so our current largest customer is 80 megawatts so it s going to be north of that they re still trying to figure out what equipment they re going to have in their mine design we re working with them through that process over the balance of this year so don t really have a firm estimate of what that top line revenue impact would be but you could probably calculate pretty close yourself if you re looking at that above 80 megawatt type load and a typical capacity factor of a mine so you could probably get pretty close so yeah we re expecting them to start building early next year the transmission line that will serve them we expect that to start later this year and as hudbay has put out for this mine they re expecting that full production to be in by the end of 2022 so that is in our longer term forecast now it s moved around quite a bit over the last two years but that s the timeline that we currently have nicholas campanella bank of america merrill lynch analyst appreciate it that s it for me thanks again barry v perry president chief executive officer thanks nick operator your next question comes from the line of robert catellier from cibc please go ahead robert catellier cibc world markets analyst hey good morning i was wondering if you could characterize what type of run rate you have to increase renewables at tep and uns given that you re bumping up against some of the renewable portfolio standards there barry v perry president chief executive officer david david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations so the obviously putting in the 250 megwatt oso grande project is going to be a big one for us that s the one that we currently have on our time horizon we expect that to be done by the end of next year that with a couple purchase power agreements that also come in next year will bring our portfolio to over 1 000 megawatts so we ve got we re doing all the plans for integrating not only that 1 000 megawatts but making room for a little more so we don t have a firm number for additional renewable resources that we will build over that near term but just to keep your eye out for our preliminary integrated resource plan that we re going to be filing here in the next couple weeks will show you what those resources look like now and then we re going to go through about a year long stakeholder process get input from our commission other stakeholders and develop a final integrated resource plan that will lay that out in a little bit more detail that won t be finished until about a year form now but it ll give you a pretty good heads up we plan on our current plan is owning any additional renewable energy that we put in the ground for our customers on a going forward basis because the vast majority other than this big wind project has been ppas so that s how you could look at it robert catellier cibc world markets analyst okay and then barry i wanted you to help me with the rate cases in bc you ve been an advocate for canadian regulators to improve the competitiveness of the cost of capital and the roes and the equity thicknesses basically i wondered if you could tell us how the rate applications in bc address that and help make the returns more competitive barry v perry president chief executive officer well this case that we ve field does not include cost of capital so costs of capital in bc it s a separate process rob so we ll obviously once we get to that we will be incorporating our thoughts in that filing i will just be clear to say that the canadian regulatory landscape is inferior to the us landscape our equity thickness is a full 10 points lower than our american businesses and that over the long term is a major competitive issue for canadian companies and it has to be fixed so we but we have to make a case of why it s good for our customers to fix that and we ll be doing that and that is a challenge that fortis is taking on and we re going to work transparently with respect with our regulators in canada to try to improve that situation robert catellier cibc world markets analyst if barry the question was actually in the context of the fact that this rate case doesn t address cost of capital i was wondering if there s any other items in there that help make it more balanced on a risk adjusted basis that might not meet the eye because they re not capital items barry v perry president chief executive officer roger s here to make a comment roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc morning robert just on the application itself traditionally in bc going back to the 90s cost of capital has been set separately that s rate of return as well as equity thickness from rate application so it s not unusual that our multiyear rate plan does not include a specific filing for cost of capital our last decision on cost of capital was 2016 so we do look time to time at financial situations to determine whether we ll be bringing forth a new cost of capital allocation we ve just filed this multiyear rate application as this application rolls forward we ll make another decision on when we think the right time is to bring forth a new cost of capital application as far as the application itself it s really an extension of the existing pvr they have a different focus the current pvr was really rooted in productivity efficiency on both o m and capital this program maintains this application maintains many of the same elements but it s more of a focus on targeted incentives around low carbon energy on demand side management and innovation so it s not directly changing in our view it s more of an extension of our current regulatory construct not a large departure so we don t see it having an impact right now on our view of cost of capital robert catellier cibc world markets analyst okay thank you very much barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you rob operator your next question comes from the line of rob hope with scotiabank please go ahead robert hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone want to circle back with rosemont just want to get a sense of when the relatively short transmission line to the mine would be completed as well as appreciate david s comments on load but just want to get a sense of how much load do you think you re going to get that project during the construction of it barry v perry president chief executive officer so rob you re peeling you want to peel the onion robert hope scotiabank analyst a little bit david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations i guess i was a little too vague purposely so because they still are developing their mining plan as far as the construction goes we should have that line built by the end of next year it s only a 13 mile route so the engineering is mostly done we have been doing prep work for that for years so it s all permitted and ready to go we just need to get it in time for them to start their operations but yeah i really can t say much more about the expected load there robert hope scotiabank analyst all right so let s do a broader question then so barry when you look at the overall market and the very strong valuations we re seeing on energy infrastructure items either majority or minority interests how do you weigh further strengthening the balance sheet versus your existing asset suite barry v perry president chief executive officer well first of all rob i take you back to the fact that we laid out a strong funding plan for the existing capital program and we re executing well on that plan and that does see our credit metrics improve over time so we ll start there but i would say frankly any offers we would receive on assets that would be similar to or better than what we got for waneta everything is for sale at those levels any ceo of a large public company would have to entertain those kinds of offers and i don t see those showing up but if they did appear for certain of our assets we would have to look at them david hutchens executive vice president western utility operations barry i could add a little color related to rosemont because one of the things that you re talking about the transmission line i think it s important to point out that we don t pay for that transmission line rosemont is paying the cad 30 million it ll take to construct that so when you look at from a customer perspective and that cash flow versus investment we have to make absolutely zero investment in order to serve rosemont so that s a really nice asset to have joining our company with a customer that size zero additional infrastructure need and obviously a big customer so that might provide a little bit of color for that later period cash topic robert hope scotiabank analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david quezada from raymond james please go ahead david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst thanks morning everyone my first question here just on wataynikaneyap just curious if there s any color you can provide on the permitting process and just if you could comment at all on whether or not that s going as expected barry v perry president chief executive officer it s going very well and gary smith who heads up that project for us is here gary you want to give an update gary j smith executive vice president eastern canadian and caribbean operations yeah we ve been at the permitting process for for sure pretty hard now for a couple of years and we ve met all the requirements in the permitting process the file now is in front of the minister to make a decision we just think there s a little bit more time required for them to digest the information we ve provided but we don t see any critical hurdles in our way to stop the project from moving forward so we do expect to get a decision soon but again exactly when that will be later this year is undetermined david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst okay that s good color thank you and maybe just one other one i realize this is a longer term opportunity but just on big chino if you had any early consultations with stakeholders there and how that process has been going barry v perry president chief executive officer well big chino is an interesting project obviously theoretically it s a great project for the region to have long durations of pump storage it would greatly enhance the ability of the region southwest region to bring more renewables onto the grid solar wind that being said it is a big project that would take seven eight years to complete and so we re evaluating our involvement in that project at this point in time and continuing to do certain initiatives there but i would say that it s a project we ll be making a decision on this year whether we continue to put development dollars into it going forward david quezada raymond james associates inc analyst okay fair enough thank you for that that s all for me operator your next question comes from the line of linda ezergailis with td securities please go ahead linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you i m wondering if you could help us understand whether your current funding plan addresses or should eliminate the negative outlook that s p has or how you feel about defending your s p rating versus potentially a downgrade barry v perry president chief executive officer well i would hope that they would remove it related to our strong execution in investing in our regulated businesses linda we re continuing to have good dialogue with s p i would not expect any immediate actions from them jocelyn you want to add jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i just i would say that the negative outlook stems from obviously post us tax reform and so any us tax reform was as expected for us and we do expect to get back to a metric similar to pre us tax reform in a few years so i suspect that that will create even better dialogue with s p barry v perry president chief executive officer yeah and linda to be clear i d like bbb unsecured debt rating with s p linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you that s helpful and maybe we can move on to aitken creek i realize that it s hard to predict that earnings stream but maybe you can help us see year to date what you re seeing both from a volume and margin perspective and beyond just help and deleveraging or funding would maybe moving that asset to rate based or for the right price exiting help your risk profile from a business risk perspective with rating agencies or some other strategic benefit barry v perry president chief executive officer i would say in a perfect world linda roger is sitting right next to me here so i would like to see that asset in regulated operations it is a critical asset for the management of the gas network in western canada and our utility fortisbc uses a lot of the capacity of the plant that s something we ll be thinking about in the future in terms of performance in the quarter and longer term performance i think since we bought it the asset has done very well it s actually i would say outperformed our expectations there s some potential to also expand the asset a little bit so roger maybe you can add some color on where we are in the quarter and some of the reasons why that we had a light quarter roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc yeah thanks barry morning linda i think the main driver is q1 2018 there s a couple of things happening that were not prevalent in 2019 so we had a colder regional winter q4 17 q1 18 relative to what we experienced in 2019 we had a very mild winter in the region pacific northwest and we experienced winter more into february and into march than the previous year so we had a greater demand for gas power storage q1 2018 we also had some maintenance constraints so gas prices were generally higher so there was a significant amount of gas pulled out of the ground in 2018 we are closing off deals and realizing the value of the market at the time 2019 partly because of weather and the enbridge situation there was lower prices so we were injecting more than withdrawing in the quarter that s really the driver we feel that q1 2019 was a good quarter but not as strong as 18 because of those factors linda ezergailis td securities analyst and can you comment on the scale of a potential expansion and the timing what factors need to be in place to expand that asset roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc we are just connecting to the north artery which is a small expansion of the system we are looking at development of the north aitken field that would be a few years away we don t have specific capital estimates yet it s really going to be determinant on market factors in the next two to three years so more to come on that one barry v perry president chief executive officer but fairly small in terms of capital roger roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc yeah less maybe cad 100 million linda ezergailis td securities analyst and what factors would need to be in place to move it to rate based roger dall antonia president chief executive officer fortis bc inc and fortisbc energy inc just lng development natural gas expansion in the pacific northwest ongoing increased demand for natural gas which we think is positive but those things will develop over time linda ezergailis td securities analyst okay thank you and maybe just a final high level strategic question i guess for barry given some of the recent changes in provincial governments how has that affected your strategic lens and outlook on those geographies and does that increase the urgency to address some of your cost of capital issues you have with canada or might there be some opportunities to potentially to nonregulated assets in those geographies can you comment on i guess alberta and to a lesser extent ontario and anywhere else specifically that you think there s been a change in policy that might help or affect your business barry v perry president chief executive officer that s a big question linda i ll try to address it we re not overly interested in nonregulated assets other than i would say things like lng tolling or the contracted transmission that the erie connector would be involved in so things that look and feel like regulated items i would say in terms of the region we have a very positive relationship with the government in british columbia our natural gas business is doing well there a fair amount of investment going into our pipeline network we added 22 000 customers in british columbia last year 2 customer growth was probably one of the strongest growing natural gas franchises in all of north america and so we re very positive on that business and we re aligning reducing carbon intensity of our product there focusing on renewable natural gas gas for transportation all of these things that are obviously consistent with government policy in alberta across the border we have an electric franchise distribution only alberta still grows our business there by 5 6 a year it s a strong business and we re working obviously through the regulatory regime in alberta it has the thinnest equity in all of canada 37 that s a significant issue and we need to see some improvement there but the distribution network that s comprised of over a million poles is a very strong franchise and we continue to have a good relationship with the previous government and i expect it will be the case with this government and i think that s the benefit of what you get with fortis we have these local teams who are running the business with their local independent boards dealing with the matters that they face within their territories and it s been a pretty successful model for our company and i would expect that that would continue going forward linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you barry v perry president chief executive officer thanks linda operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kuske from credit suisse please go ahead andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst good morning i guess the question starts off with barry and it s just on energy conservation and the efforts behind that how do you think about returns on that business activity this the quirky thing with regulated utilities it s probably the only industry in the world where you re effectively trying to incent people to use less of your product and service barry v perry president chief executive officer well andrew i would just say that we need to keep doing the things that reduce the company s environmental footprint our customers are demanding cleaner energy be delivered obviously always with an eye of affordability i think jurisdictions that go too far too quick run into some trouble and i always use arizona for the poster child for the way to do it they ve gotten greener incrementally every year for the last number of years but yet have kept rates very economic and affordable in that jurisdiction so they re the jurisdiction i think that people should look to so i would say regulators that are progressive enough to think that their utilities can play a major role in improving the portfolio of supply becoming more energy efficient are very progressive because utilities know how to do this and fortis knows how to do it and we can get it done quickly so i think that clearly we are looking for that and when we interact with our regulators we re looking for those opportunities and i would commend the bcuc for being very progressive in terms of this new program that we have in place in british columbia that we get to invest cad 370 million i think over the next four years it does go into rate based but it accelerates these programs very quickly and we will see results from that andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst okay appreciate that and then just maybe an extension on some of the activities you ve got going on in the portfolio and to the first question do you see any broader need to pivot into renewables to a greater degree and directly if you can do rate based renewables and then anything outside of rate based if it s in a contractual framework barry v perry president chief executive officer where we can do renewables within our utilities we would definitely pursue those but i always remind folks that most of our business is just wires and gas pipes so our we re not that involved in the generation side of the business except for arizona and david and his team there working with the corporations commission have done a really good job of improving their portfolio of supply and will continue to do so i think in america obviously renewables have become very attractive in terms of price and this oso grande wind regime david i think we re at 45 capacity factor i think something like that so these are 4 5 megawatt turbines these are great assets and so where we can do more of that we will but you have to remember fortis is more of a t d business without that i don t see us frankly we can try and we will try here and there but competing against the big renewables businesses that are non regulated that s a tough spot to go to and it s hard to make money in that area so really our core focus will be investing in our grid our energy networks as well as improving our portfolio of supply in arizona andrew kuske credit suisse group analyst okay that s great thank you barry v perry president chief executive officer thank you operator if there are any additional questions at this time please press followed by the no you re your telephone keypad your next question comes from the line of patrick kenny from national bank please go ahead patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst hey good morning just a follow up on the question around credit ratings now with the waneta proceeds in the door i m wondering if you could update us on any discussion you might be having with moody s and if there s any visibility or a roadmap to get off of the aa industry rating jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer yeah patrick this is jocelyn yeah i think i can echo barry on this one that we re not happy with the baa3 rating and we do work with moody s to understand it better and we have worked to improve it but we re having normal discussions with moody s and certainly we shared with them our funding plan out of the fall and we updated them even within this past quarter so we re having good discussions with them and they ll go through their normal ratings process but we are looking to improve this rating over the planning period yes barry v perry president chief executive officer and i ll sound defensive on this but i want to remind everyone on the call that we re bbb with dbrs we re bbb with s p and we yes we re baa3 with moody s but a lot of folks forget the other two agencies who rates us very attractively patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst thanks and jocelyn can you just remind us what the target holdco debt to total debt ratio would be for moody s jocelyn h perry executive vice president chief financial officer the moody s doesn t actually provide a target i expect it s 30 or lower patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst okay great and then just back to alberta and the regulatory outlook there how should we be thinking about the auc potentially moving to a formula based roe by 2022 i know it s still a ways off but i guess based on the shape of the interest rate curve today i m wondering if you think this represents upside or downside to the 8 5 barry v perry president chief executive officer i can only hope that it represents upside since i can t imagine we can go much lower than where we are but that clearly we patrick we ll be in that process making sure that we put good evidence forward to make sure that those any outcome that would suggest it should be lower than that would not be appropriate clearly regulators will do what they do but i would hope that we could put forward strong evidence to suggest that any outcome that would generate an roe even where we are today is not appropriate patrick kenny national bank financial markets analyst okay that s great thanks barry thanks jocelyn operator thank you there are no further questions i would now like to turn the call back to ms amaimo for closing remarks stephanie amaimo thank you jessa

start quantitative easing by buying bonds to lower interest rates powell did not respond directly to trump s suggestions but he says the fed went through a lengthy debate over two days of discussions before announcing its decision on wednesday to keep its policy rate unchanged we don t think about other factors outside of how the economy is doing powell says he says the panel felt that the fed s policies on interest rates were in a good place file in this march 20 2019 file photo federal reserve chair jerome powell speaks during a news conference in washington on wednesday may 1 the federal reserve releases its latest monetary policy statement after a two day meeting ap photo susan walsh file ___ 3 30 p m federal reserve chairman jerome powell acknowledges that the u s central bank has struggled to meet its target of 2 inflation powell tells reporters at a news conference that many central banks have fallen short of their inflation goals saying that this likely reflects demographic and global forces that are disinflationary still powell is confident that the underlying factors keeping u s inflation below 2 are transitory he said that clothing prices dropped because of changes in the methodology and that airfare prices have been low there are reasons to think those are transitory and will turn around he says ___ 3 14 p m stock and bond markets seesawed between gains and losses wednesday afternoon as investors weighed the federal reserve s assessment of the economy and the prospects for future interest rate moves both stocks and bonds rallied after the fed released its policy statement which noted that inflation remained unusually low as the economy continues to remain healthy the yield on the 2 year treasury note fell sharply to 2 21 from 2 26 that came as investors aggressively bought the notes anticipating that the fed would want to keep rates low however stocks and bonds reversed course and turned mixed after fed chairman jerome powell declined to say whether some investors are misguided in expecting the central bank to trim interest rates this year something traders have been betting will happen before year s end ___ 3 05 p m federal reserve chairman jerome powell avoided commenting on some controversial views voiced by president trump s pick for the fed s board of governors stephen moore powell was asked if recent strong wage gains among women workers which have outpaced men s wage increases posed a potential problem for the economy moore has written in the past that when women make more than men it can threaten family stability one of many provocative comments that have threatened his potential nomination on capitol hill i think men and women should make the same amount for the same work powell responded but when pressed he declined to go further it s not my role to engage on any nominee for the fed he added ___ 2 45 p m powell declined to say whether some investors are misguided in expecting the u s central bank to trim interest rates this year powell has effectively hit pause on any future rate hikes leading to speculation that the fed could choose to cut rates as insurance against an economic slowdown but powell ducked the question at a news conference the committee is comfortable with our current policy stance he said ___ 2 35 p m president donald trump s controversial choice for the federal reserve board of governors issued a statement supporting his own nomination within a minute of fed officials announcing that they would keep a key short term rate unchanged stephen moore the economics and politics commentator issued a statement through a public relations firm that noted support from jeremy siegel a finance professor at the university of pennsylvania who was interviewed on cnbc siegel says that moore would help solve the federal reserve s groupthink problem moore favors cutting rates a stance shared by trump but moore s statement also criticizes the possibility of trying to spend 2 trillion on infrastructure by raising taxes ___ 2 p m the federal reserve is leaving its key interest rate unchanged and signaling that no rate hikes are likely in coming months amid signs of renewed economic health but unusually low inflation the fed left its benchmark rate which influences many consumer and business loans in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 the central bank s low rate policy has helped boost stock prices and supported a steadily growing economy whose outlook has brightened since late last year the fed did make a technical adjustment to trim the interest it pays banks on reserves to 2 35 percent as a way to keep its benchmark rate inside its approved range the decision wednesday to make no change in the policy rate policy had been expected despite renewed pressure from president donald trump for the fed to cut rates aggressively to help accelerate economic growth the fed statement had a more upbeat view of the economy saying that economic activity rose at a solid rate in march the fed said that it appeared growth had slowed from the fourth quarter ___ 12 15 p m stocks are edging higher on wall street and bond yields are lower ahead of the federal reserve s latest policy statement investors will be closely parsing the fed s announcement which is due out later wednesday afternoon particularly any references to how the fed thinks the economy is doing assurances from the fed late last year that any interest rate increases in 2019 were unlikely helped the stock market recover from a steep rout investors had worried that the fed could destabilize the economy if it continued raising borrowing costs the s p 500 and the dow jones industrial average were both up about 0 1 at midday bond prices rose after a report on the manufacturing sector came in weaker than analysts anticipated the yield on the 10 year treasury fell to 2 48 ___ 4 45 a m stock markets are edging higher ahead of a federal reserve policy meeting at which the central bank is not expected to change its interest rates but could give clues on their future direction futures for the dow and the s p 500 are both up 0 4 the indexes that are open for trading in europe where much of the region is closed for a holiday are also up slightly with britain s ftse 100 up 0 1 the dollar was steady against the yen and euro fed chairman jerome powell will hold a news conference after the fed meeting ends wednesday economists expect the fed to say that it will not increase its key interest rates anytime soon as it monitors the health of the u s and global economy low rates tend to help stock markets and the economy by making it cheaper to borrow money president donald trump has called for what no mainstream economist is advocating interest rate cuts ___ 12 05 a m the federal reserve is all but sure to keep interest rates on hold wednesday and for the foreseeable future even as president donald trump keeps up his attacks on the fed for not cutting rates the fed will likely reiterate a message that has reassured consumers and investors since the start of the year no rate hikes are likely anytime soon the fed s low rate policy is keeping borrowing costs down helping boost stock prices and supporting an economy that s growing steadily and with inflation remaining tame the fed is seen as able to stay on the sidelines at least through this year yet trump insists the economy can do better and to that end he is demanding what almost no mainstream economist would favor cutting rates further
h johannes witteveen a dutch economist and politician who navigated a whirlwind of financial turbulence as the head of the international monetary fund from 1973 to 1978 all while enlarging the fund s role as a lender and manager of the global economy died april 23 he was 97 dr witteveen pronounced vit uh vane was a longtime practitioner and leader of universal sufism a religious philosophy rooted in islam and was known by fellow sufis as murshid karimbakhsh witteveen his death was announced by the sufi movement of the netherlands which did not say where or how he died dour and ascetic with a reputation as a soft spoken consensus builder dr witteveen arrived at the imf during a period in which some economists questioned its very existence the fund had been established in large part to manage the world s system of fixed currency exchange rates but that financial order collapsed after the united states floated the dollar in 1971 and the imf seemed to become an organization without a mission advertisement in the aftermath of the 1973 arab israeli war oil prices exploded eventually quadrupling exacerbating a period of global recession and inflation dubbed stagflation for the first time since the depression each of the world s major economies was in a recession at the same time as managing director of the imf dr witteveen helped quiet the waters engineering an 8 billion relief measure in which oil producing nations recycled revenue to poorer countries in the form of imf loans that were used to buy oil address payment imbalances and prop up world trade countries were instructed to adopt belt tightening adjustment measures in exchange for the loans what witteveen did was bring back to being relevant in a world in which poor countries that didn t export oil were extremely vulnerable said harold james a financial historian at princeton university he reoriented the fund from thinking about a world in which there were fixed exchange rates and where the bigger countries needed policing to a world in which capital is moving and creating instability advertisement notable deaths in 2019 elijah cummings cokie roberts toni morrison and others we have lost this year 65 remembering those who have died in 2019 dr witteveen negotiated the loan packages himself drawing on his political experience in the netherlands a member of the socially liberal pro business people s party for freedom and democracy he was elected to both houses of his country s legislature served two stints as minister of finance and was deputy prime minister from 1967 to 1971 under piet de jong describing his dutch political career the observer of london once called him a velvet fist in an iron glove at the imf dr witteveen stood firm against the nixon and ford administrations which urged him to denounce opec after some members of the organization of oil producing states issued an embargo against nations that supported israel during the 1973 arab israeli war that aside dr witteveen was generally credited with repairing the relationship between the united states and the imf where his predecessor pierre paul schweitzer had battled with the nixon administration over floating the dollar advertisement dr witteveen compromising between nations that favored fixed rate and floating currency exchanges negotiated an arrangement in which the fund could exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of its member countries in 1976 he signed off on a then record 3 9 billion emergency loan to britain where the pound had lost much of its value and inflation had risen above 25 percent the bailout helped stabilize the country s finances and was part of a wave of loan packages that dramatically increased the fund s role as an international lender according to the new york times member countries were borrowing less than 1 billion from the fund in 1973 when dr witteveen took office four years later borrowing topped 7 billion in his final year as managing director dr witteveen collected 10 billion from the fund s wealthy members to create a new loan program dubbed the witteveen facility for needy countries advertisement upon his retirement the economist magazine likened the imf to a phoenix saying that it had risen from the ashes of fixed exchange rates and quadrupled oil prices with its claim intact to be the overseer of those parts of the world s monetary system that the world allows it to oversee share this article share over the next five years under mr jacques de larosière the imf s path will be strewn with familiar rocks the magazine continued referring to mr witteveen s successor mr witteveen has done much to chart the best routes round them hendrikus johannes witteveen was born in the town of zeist in the central netherlands on june 12 1921 his father was an urban planner and his grandfather was a socialist senator dr witteveen studied at the netherlands school of economics now erasmus university rotterdam under jan tinbergen who was later awarded the first nobel prize in economics he received a doctorate in 1947 and worked as a government economist and a professor at his alma mater launching his political career when he entered the senate in 1958 advertisement although many of dr witteveen s supporters assumed he would run for a second term as imf managing director he chose instead to retire citing personal reasons that included the illness of one of his children he went on to become the first chairman of the group of thirty a washington based nonprofit organization that researches international economic and monetary affairs and also served on the boards of companies including royal dutch petroleum and the asset management firm robeco dr witteveen s wife liesbeth de vries feijens an oncology professor died in 2006 they had four children including willem witteveen a dutch politician who died in 2014 aboard malaysia airlines flight 17 the plane was shot down over eastern ukraine amid conflict between the government in kiev and russian backed separatists a dutch inquiry later concluded that the aircraft was downed by a missile that came from the russian military advertisement a complete list of survivors was not immediately available dr witteveen was co president of the international sufi movement a sufi organization that espouses universal harmony the sort of peaceful coexistence of nations and people that dr witteveen sought through his work at the imf often even at the height of his career he seemed more interested in discussing the mysteries of the human soul than the intricacies of global finance western man has directed himself too much toward the external he said according to a 1973 profile in the times too many fear the internal life the mystical world is the most beautiful experience it is a pure gift of god
