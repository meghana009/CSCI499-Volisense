the year 2018 saw a mix of conflict and cooperation among the three global economic powers the united states china and european union during his first year in office donald trump eschewed confrontational trade policies over which corporate america is divided in favor of a domestic policy agenda designed to effect a massive upward redistribution of wealth including the lowest corporate tax rate since 1939 alongside a host of business friendly regulatory policies only in 2018 did he turn his attention to trade emboldened by a surging economy starting in march 2018 he enacted a series of tariffs export controls restrictions on foreign investment and sanctions however in july the united states and eu declared a ceasefire with both sides agreeing not to impose additional tariffs pending further negotiations in september the united states mexico and canada agreed on but have not yet ratified a renegotiated nafta re named the usmca a revised u s south korea free trade agreement korus was also signed negotiations on a transatlantic trade agreement are set to resume in 2019 but they will be contentious the trump administration wants to open up european agriculture to u s farmers and is threatening to impose tariffs on european auto exports if it does not but auto tariffs would generate significant domestic opposition the threat might not be credible and in any case europe is unlikely to make significant concessions with respect to agriculture even as he sought to reduce economic conflicts with g 7 countries and other allies trump raised the stakes with china the 2018 u s national defense strategy declared that china seeks indo pacific regional hegemony in the near term and displacement of the united states to achieve global preeminence in the future in march trump imposed tariffs on 250 billion in exports and threatened to impose duties on an additional 267 billion of chinese goods china retaliated with tariffs on autos and politically important agricultural commodities in his speech at the hudson institute in october vice president pence announced a systematic strategy of containment against china china and the united states have both ramped up military activity in the south china sea acting defense secretary patrick shanahan s new year message for 2019 was to remember china china china yet bilateral discussions between trump and xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 conference in buenos aires in december and between mid level trade negotiators in beijing in early january resulted in concessions by both sides in december trump agreed to refrain from enacting further tariffs on china until march 1 pending further discussions china responded in january by recommencing purchases of u s soybeans dropping retaliatory measures against u s auto exports resuming crude oil imports and pledging dialogue on structural reforms with respect to intellectual property subsidies and fdi these conciliatory steps reflect the recognition in washington and beijing that their financial markets and economies are acutely vulnerable to protectionist policies and rhetoric a lesson that resonated especially with donald trump reeling from republican mid term election losses and contemplating the 2020 presidential election amid growing economic turbulence in its january 2019 global economic prospects report entitled darkening skies the world bank warns that storm clouds are brewing over the world economy china s economy is slowing with official gdp growth projected to fall to 6 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 amid steep declines in fdi fixed asset investment retail sales industrial production and profits china is experiencing significant overcapacity resulting in declining global material prices and already high and seemingly unstable levels of debt chinese equities declined by more than 25 during 2018 it s fdi in europe and north america is falling precipitously as a result of restrictions imposed by washington and brussels the situation for europe is no less precarious slowing growth in china will hit not only the rest of asia but also germany which experienced negative growth and declining exports during the third quarter of 2018 german business confidence has plummeted although the imf anticipates 1 9 growth for 2019 the eu faces tremendous economic and political headwinds the ecb has slowed its asset purchases and plans to phase out its stimulus program and raise interest rates by the end of the year emmanuel macron s neoliberal project has been derailed by the yellow vest protests italy is mired in stagnation and debt regardless of the form that it eventually takes the brexit will do significant harm to both the uk and europe it will not open up a path to greater independence and unity in the eu or within the eurozone now crippled by seemingly permanent crisis of austerity under german leadership the franco german entente is on its deathbed germany has rebuffed emmanuel macron s pleas for a more expansive fiscal policy france and germany are deeply divided over trade negotiations with the united states in december german automobile executives carried out private negotiations with u s trade representative robert lighthizer in the white house making new commitments to the u s market and raising eyebrows in brussels and paris even as the administration downgraded the eu s diplomatic status apparently without even informing it notwithstanding torrents of bold and indignant rhetoric with the partial exception of nordstream 2 the eu can do little against u s extraterritorial sanctions that cause significant economic as well as political damage european parliamentary elections in may will almost certainly bring further gains to populist and euroskeptic forces the prognosis for the u s economy is more mixed with projected 3 growth for 2019 but even so there are signs of fragility the recovery that started in 2009 cannot last indefinitely especially if the federal reserve continues to increase interest rates and the fiscal stimulus resulting from the 1 5 billion tax cuts but also producing a ballooning budget deficit and raising the national debt to 22 trillion diminishes the u s government shutdown is also beginning to take its toll on the economy while the united states and china will certainly not resolve their underlying conflicts before the march 1 deadline that trump has imposed both sides have strong incentives to preserve the current truce however many contentious issues remain above all the transfer of technology with economic but also massive military implications as it becomes more aware of china s growing economic and military ascent corporate america appears to be moving gradually towards the more hawkish position already staked out by the office of the u s trade representative the pentagon and both parties in congress u s multinational corporations will not easily relinquish their tenuous primacy within an asian market that is projected to account for more than 50 of global gdp by 2050 the year 2019 might also see the further unfolding of the trend towards global bifurcation many u s firms are gradually shifting their supply chains out of china to other asian countries or contemplating this step the united states is also placing more pressure on its central and eastern european nato allies to support its containment strategy the eu has begun to restrict chinese acquisitions of european companies in strategic sectors the usmca explicitly prevents its members from signing a free trade agreement with a non market economy ie china canada s detention of the cfo of huawei at the behest of washington followed by the arrest of a huawei executive in poland on charges of espionage provide further evidence of this trend a comprehensive trade war in 2019 is unlikely but the u s china rivalry is in its infancy

china s private sector is expected to suffer another liquidity squeeze this year gatley wrote that funds from the banking system might flow into the coffers of state firms and state enterprises which

ting chief china economist at nomura international in hong kong said that beijing is so far relying almost entirely on infrastructure investment to stimulate the economy lu said deregulating property

month by cutting their required reserve ratio rrr the percentage of their assets they must hold in reserve at the central bank while government ministries are busy with strategies to act upon president xi jinping s warning on the economy some analysts believe the proper response to china s economic problems is to give small firms and the private sector greater latitude photo xinhua economists expected the pboc to cut the reserve ratio by an additional 100 150 basis points later this year to prompt banks to offer more credit to private companies however lv tie a researcher at the institute of industrial economics in chinese academy of social sciences said the government should not focus on such preferential policies but rather needed to take steps to build up a better business

government should only give financial aid to who are experiencing an emergency not the ones perennially in need of money lv said

and us 55 respectively both he said continue to look bullish even though there could be some softness in the immediate future as long as brent holds above us 59 and wti us 50 i still think these look bullish going forward but that doesn t mean we can t see some consolidation for now after 24 per cent plus gains over the last month he said this should be well supported by the success of the output

increasingly intertwined think of how higher tariffs and rising uncertainty over future trade policy fed into lower asset prices and higher market volatility lagarde said this in turn contributed to tightening financial conditions including for advanced economies which is a major risk factor in a world of high debt burdens does that mean that a global recession is around the corner the answer is

rima m rakesh sharma moneycontrol contributors world economic forum s wef annual january meeting in davos klosters a mountain resort in graubünden in the eastern alps region of switzerland is a much awaited coming together of over 2 500 international business and political leaders economists celebrities and eager beaver journalists story continues below advertisement remove ad for over four days the world and its affairs are debated reviewed and scrutinised while the international media capture ponderous soundbytes and entertaining sights the world economic forum wef is based in cologny geneva switzerland and was founded in 1971 as a not for profit organization and subsequently it evolved into an international institution for public private cooperation committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business political academic and other leaders of society to shape global regional and industry agendas every year it also convenes six to eight regional meetings in locations across africa east asia latin america china india and the united arab emirates basically the idea is to synergise stakeholders from business government and civil society and find solutions to some of the most pressing issues the world is facing right now story continues below advertisement remove ad this year the news coverage of the summit has already informed us that the super rich at davos are scared of american congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez s tax hike idea for the moneyed we have also been told that naturalist sir david attenborough has categorically stated at davos that the world as we once knew as the the garden of eden is no more and it is becoming increasingly clear that this time at davos there will be a few discomforting facts that even the world s most powerful men and women will find it hard to ignore but there is also trivia to make you smile as cnbc reported recently at davos attendees habitually hitch a ride across snow covered pathways in electric golf carts proudly wear knitted blue bobble hats attend innovative virtual reality workshops where they can pretend to be trees and arrive at meetings swishing their colour coded passes so yes this is a spectacle much like any other but also like no other ironic too considering all the noise about climate change and how davos is expecting the highest number of private jets landing this year but on this edition of digging deeper with moneycontrol with me rakesh sharma we will focus on the india story at davos and what multiple growth projections are prognosticating this india story at the swiss alps not the yash raj kind is our topic today story continues below advertisement remove ad a story of many highs and a few lows let us begin with the international monetary fund s first woman chief economist gita gopinath who on january 21 as bloomberg quint reported flagged in davos the risks associated with india s high fiscal deficit while refusing to comment on specific government policies gopinath stated and we quote in the case of india what we flag is the fact that the overall consolidated fiscal deficit remains high and it has been the case for the last five years we certainly need to fix that her comments came at a time when the india government in the run up to the elections is said to be planning a cash handout to distressed farmers bloomberg reported that the plan to give cash to farmers instead of subsidies will come at an additional cost of roughly rs 70 000 crore to the exchequer annually however india has already exceeded its fiscal deficit target this means the government would have very limited fiscal space to boost spending in an election year the report also states that part of india s fiscal slippage risks come from the continued weakness in the goods and services tax collections and gopinath said and we quote again gst revenues haven t come in at the rate with which it was expected and that would be an area for continued improvement another cautionary voice was that of international monetary fund s imf managing director christine lagarde at davos in an interview to india today tv lagarde said that given the demographic conditions indian economy should be growing faster than the rate at which it is growing now she conceded that while multiple reforms have been undertaken by the government there is still a lot left to be done earlier this week you will remember that imf had projected india to grow at 7 5 percent in 2019 and 7 7 percent in 2020 and had said that the country would be the fastest among the major growing economies of the world lagarde further told india today that while it is a good sign that the projected growth is high still the government needs to address the crisis in the agriculture sector as a large number of people depend on this sector she further stated that the creation of activity and economic value that leads to employment generation is critical for the country to grow one of the most contentious issues faced by the current government is growing unemployment and international labour organisation ilo has pegged india s unemployment rate at 3 5 percent in 2018 and says india today it is most likely to continue in 2019 we quote according to the data there will be 18 9 million jobless people in india in 2019 a little more than 18 6 million in 2018 economic crisis unemployment and farm loan crisis has been some of the critical issues over which the government is being targeted by the opposition and will continue to dominate the headlines in the coming days as the country enters the election phase giving thumbs down to the loan waiving tendencies of the indian government the imf chief said that such policies need to be revisited let us not forget though the happy projections according to which india s growth in 2018 is expected to be at 7 3 percent which is 10 basis points higher than the government s own estimate as imf put it india s economy is poised to pick up in 2019 benefiting from lower oil prices and a slower pace of monetary tightening than previously expected as inflation pressures ease these projections are reassuring that india s economy stumbled significantly post demonetisation and the reconfiguration of its indirect tax structure as bloomberg quint pointed out it would be prudent though to weigh the risks inherent in the imf s outlook cross border trade tensions are escalating and global trade investment and output remains under threat for that reason multilateral and domestic policies must prevent additional deceleration and also strengthen resilience says the piece imf has cautioned not just india but all countries of escalating trade tensions and public and private debt affecting growth and has also urged policymakers to cooperate and work towards resolving these issues and also to acknowledge the clear and present danger of climate change other potential triggers that could slow down global economy says cnbc include a no deal brexit for the uk and a deeper than envisaged slowdown in china in a significant move imf revised down its estimates for global growth earlier this week and now projects a 3 5 percent growth rate worldwide for 2019 and 3 6 percent for 2020 cnbc reports that these are 0 2 and 0 1 percentage points below its last forecasts in october making it the second downturn revision in three months india would do well to heed lagarde s advice to policy makers at davos that government debt must be reduced monetary policy should be data dependent and economic reforms should aim to lift growth including in the labour market the naysaying critics yahoo finance chose to touch upon the downside of the global elite coming together to serve their own interests the organisers of the wef meet claim that for almost 50 years the forum has been the catalyst for global initiatives historic shifts industry breakthroughs economic ideas and tens of thousands of projects and collaborations yet as yahoo points out critics of the summit have often feared more dangerous consequences from the global elite coming together in one place sceptical about whose interests it serves and how much participants really want to improve the planet the piece quotes jp morgan chase chief executive jamie dimon who once famously said where billionaires tell millionaires what the middle class feels as multiple news sources have reported davos will host more than 350 official sessions over 900 civil society and 1 700 business leaders during the event the event would also be attended by ceos of a large number of mncs including adidas rio tinto embraer axa societe generale total allianz bayer deutsche bank lufthansa kpmg siemens generali hitachi nomura sumitomo ikea royal dutch shell telenor alibaba credit suisse nestle novartis ubs barclays bp standard chartered unilever bank of america cargill citi cisco dell ibm morgan stanley pepsico pfizer coca cola and visa oxfam s damning annual report just before the davos meet highlights the unequal distribution of wealth across the globe and as yahoo says for some the summit has come to symbolise the failures of globalisation and free market economics is the 2019 summit addressing these issues well the theme of this year s summit is globalization 4 0 shaping a global architecture in the age of the fourth industrial revolution while the summit addresses the impact of technological changes like automation digitisation and artificial intelligence on human life it is also conceding that this is a time of unprecedented uncertainty fragility and controversy yahoo adds issues like increased global tensions nationalistic politics and sluggish global growth in the mix to complicate the debate further indian voices at davos press trust of india captured a moment of national pride on january 23 2019 when it recounted a statement made by the former rbi governor raghuram rajan who said in davos that india will eventually surpass china in economic size and will be in a better position to create infrastructure addressing a session on strategic outlook for south asia at davos rajan also said that the indian economy would continue to grow rajan said historically india had a bigger role in the region but china has now grown much bigger than india and has presented itself as a counter balance to india in the region india will become bigger than china eventually as china would slow down and india would continue to grow so india will be in a better position to create the infrastructure in the region which china is promising today but this competition is good for the region and it will benefit for sure the comments assume significance according to pti with china working on a lot of infrastructure projects across the region including in nepal and in pakistan in 2017 india became the sixth largest economy with a gdp of 2 59 trillion while china was the second largest with a gdp of 12 23 trillion as per world bank data rajan also said that said there is an opportunity to create regional companies initiate free trade student exchange et al for better understanding among asian countries on 23 january 2019 india today brought another important indian voice to light and reported what bharti enterprises chief sunil mittal said at davos mittal said foreign investors certainly look for stability and if they look at a lot of loose arrangements in the government people may start to hold back investment stability in any nation is important and especially for a country as diverse as india stability is always good the indian presence at davos is substantial ndtv reported on january 20 2019 that among the indian political leaders attending the summit are madhya pradesh chief minister kamal nath union commerce and industry minister suresh prabhu andhra pradesh minister lokesh nara and punjab minister manpreet badal the indian corporate presence at davos is significant too and includes names like gautam adani mukesh ambani with wife neeta and children akash and isha sanjiv bajaj n chandrasekaran sajjan jindal anand mahindra pawan goenka with wife mamta sunil mittal nandan nilekani salil parekh azim premji and son rishad ravi ruia and ajay singh the ever ubiquitous karan johar is there too and so is new development bank president k v kamath members of the media will be eagerly rubber necking from the sidelines to catch a glimpse of microsoft s indian origin ceo satya nadella who is expected to make his appearance as well the summit says ndtv will have several india focussed sessions though the impetus is upon identifying new models for peace inclusiveness and sustainability and addressing global risks including rising geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions another session reports ndtv would focus on india and the world which would cover the country s emergence as a compelling growth story and the questions being raised about its long term sustainability due to a falling rupee volatile external financial markets worsening current account deficit and stress in the banking sector in summation possibly the most important statement was made by wef s founder and executive chairman klaus schwab who said and we quote this fourth wave of globalisation needs to be human centred inclusive and sustainable we are entering a period of profound global instability brought on by the technological disruption of the fourth industrial revolution and the realignment of geo economics and geopolitical forces we need principals from all stakeholder groups in davos to summon the imagination and commitment necessary to tackle it beyond press pieces critiquing jet setting global elite fretting about climate as the straits times put it or the puff paste profiles celebrating six millennials including nadella co chairing wef there is something to be said about the optimism that a gathering like this generates in the possibility of a planet better equipped to deal with economical political and environmental challenges every year davos rekindles the hope that the world can be fixed if enough people decide to fix it so we wait and watch till next year and the next
gita gopinath has a knack for asking the kind of questions that not so long ago might have raised eyebrows inside the international monetary fund where she just took over as chief economist what if more emerging markets actively managed their currencies like china does what if an influx of capital risks sapping a nation s productivity not boosting it advertisement interrogating the data for answers and using them to poke holes in the conventional playbooks for economic policy was a hallmark of 47 year old gopinath s work at harvard now she ll be expected to recommend practical fixes at a turbulent moment when the free market principles promoted by the fund for decades are under attack especially in borrower countries like greece and argentina the imf still gets portrayed as an enforcer of one size fits all policies based on austerity and the unimpeded flow of goods and money but that s been out of date for a while now fund economists advocated debt relief in greece they ve said capital controls can be useful and cautiously backed redistributive taxes when argentina had to find budget savings they insisted that the poor shouldn t bear too much of the burden don t be dogmatic advertisement the shift is likely to continue under gopinath who became the first woman to hold one of the most influential jobs in economics when she took over from maurice obstfeld this month she ll oversee the fund s research including its closely watched growth forecasts at a time when uncertainty is mounting the imf on monday downgraded its global outlook for the second time in three months to show the weakest expansion this year since 2016 more than a decade since the imf and other economists failed to predict the financial crisis gopinath used her debut press conference to highlight mounting risks including the trade war and tightening credit advertisement in her new role gopinath plans to use the broadest lens possible in search of solutions part of her job will be to review the fund s loan programs giving her a voice in practical policymaking a rethink of globalisation is pressing and it should address the distribution of benefits as well as the impact of new technologies she said in an emailed response to questions in her academic career gopinath has been willing to follow the empirical evidence wherever it leads advertisement what gita s thinking has pointed out is let s not be dogmatic said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz se and a former imf economist with all the uncertainties that the global system is having to navigate it s reassuring that at the imf you have someone like gita she s an authority on one key part of that system currency regimes the fund has tended to back floating exchange rates for reasons laid out by milton friedman allow the currency to fall the theory goes and exports become cheaper relative to imports so the country can sell more goods abroad and boost growth gopinath s research suggests that reality is more complicated and dollar dominance is one reason why for example japan us trade is overwhelmingly priced in greenbacks so a weaker yen doesn t trigger a corresponding jump in japanese exports crawling pegs advertisement that undercuts the argument of those like president donald trump who accuse competitors of gaming their currencies to gain an edge it also complicates matters for the imf whose charter requires members to avoid discriminatory currency practices the fund has struggled to develop a consistent policy said james boughton a senior fellow at the centre for international governance innovation in between fixed and floating currencies lies a bewildering range of options from botswana s crawling peg to china s stabilised arrangement gopinath s research interests and expertise could really help said boughton who was the imf s official historian for two decades she s been well grounded in the practical consequences of exchange rate policies without getting bogged down in ideology advertisement it s far from an academic matter rising us interest rates hammered emerging market currencies last year argentina whose peso collapsed turned to the imf for a record 56 billion bailout the deal permits the central bank to intervene but only outside a specified peso range an example of the hybrid approach backed by gopinath s work according to el erian who writes columns for bloomberg opinion exchange rates can overshoot and overshoot for a long time he said we have to consider different ways of approaching that issue communist kerfuffle another gopinath research topic is the impact of capital flows she looked at southern europe and found a significant decline in productivity because the money that poured in after the euro s launch wasn t allocated efficiently the imf which once considered capital controls taboo now sees them as potentially useful stabilisers when markets seesaw advertisement to gopinath these are technical questions not articles of faith she sees herself as not beholden to any political ideology she was surprised when a kerfuffle broke out over her appointment in 2016 as a government adviser in the indian state of kerala run by a communist party some members voiced fears that gopinath would impose neoliberal policies at the imf too it won t be easy to stay out of the political fray the fund is a pillar of the global order enshrined after world war ii and now showing signs of strain its headquarters are in washington three blocks from the white house where trump issues periodic threats to pull america out of the multilateral institutions it created relations are tense the imf has slammed trump s trade war as a threat to world growth while the us treasury has rejected a boost in imf funding advertisement in that climate gopinath s new job requires much more than insightful economic thinking according to raghuram rajan who held the post last decade she ll find her way said rajan who s also a former chief of india s central bank but she ll have to be if not a politician then at least a diplomat it s not an easy situation for anyone because of the political tensions he said it s a very visible position and she will have to tread carefully
the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp entered into force on december 30 2018 the agreement will significantly impact trade among its ratifying parties currently including australia canada japan mexico new zealand singapore and vietnam with brunei darussalam chile malaysia and peru to come and beyond the so called tpp 11 signed on march 8 2018 proceeded steadily toward completion following the united states withdrawal from the predecessor agreement the trans pacific partnership tpp in january 2017 and is now a reality the anticipated impact of the cptpp whose 11 parties represent approximately half a billion people and 14 percent of the global economy will be immense as slashed tariffs encourage significant shifts in global supply chains further the cptpp s high standard provisions on the digital economy investment financial services labor and the environment establish new rules of the road that will have broad country specific and collective impact the agreement s full impact is challenging to grasp as its geographical and substantive scope is vast and so much of it is new to governments and companies this report summarizes i key provisions including those changed from the original tpp ii country specific implications for select parties iv the politics and technicalities of us re entry iii next steps for ratification by remaining signatories and v the cptpp s potential impact on interaction with other global trade developments overview the cptpp despite the united states withdrawal and the subsequent minor changes to the tpp text is a game changer in that it locks in institutional and rules based reform sets new standards for future free trade agreements ftas and provides incentives to consolidate and reorder asia pacific supply chains the cptpp like its predecessor the tpp is touted as a next generation trade agreement building on the core structure of the world trade organization wto agreements and existing bilateral ftas but taking wto and fta rules further in a number of key areas such as digital trade and electronic commerce intellectual property and state owned enterprises soes thus not only will the cptpp have a tangible impact on trade in goods and services among the parties it is likely to have repercussive effects as its provisions are used as a model for other agreements for example the newly signed united states mexico canada agreement usmca the successor to the north american free trade agreement nafta draws from the tpp for some of its chapters the cptpp s broad tariff cuts on approximately 90 percent of items upon entry into force and nearly all others within 10 years will have an immediate impact on the relative competitiveness of exporters in and out of the agreement for example us exporters will now be disadvantaged in the cptpp zone relative in particular to competitors in canada japan and australia similarly exporters in thailand korea and taiwan will be disadvantaged relative to competitors in japan malaysia and vietnam in addition to tariff cuts the cptpp includes high standard chapters covering customs and trade facilitation standards and technical barriers to trade investment services intellectual property e commerce government procurement soes labor environment regulatory coherence transparency and more the cptpp is distinguished from other ftas in that its provisions are deeper and broader and its basic rules apply equally among all signatories even though some developing country members e g vietnam have longer time periods to implement some of the commitments when the agreement entered into force on december 30 2018 each of the original six ratifying members immediately benefitted from its provisions but only as they applied to the other ratifying members for example a company based in australia will benefit from reduced or eliminated import tariffs in japan but not yet malaysia provisions affecting intellectual property investment labor and other disciplines were also automatically activated vietnam joined soon after on january 14 2019 date of entry into force for the cptpp s ratifying members party date of domestic ratification date of notification to cptpp depositary entry into force australia october 19 2018 october 31 2018 december 30 2018 brunei darussalam tbc1 canada october 25 2018 october 29 2018 december

days later on january 1 2019 the year 1 cuts which vary by good and the respective party s schedule the general notes to the tariff schedule of japan set april 1 as the beginning of each tariff cycle so the year 1 tariff reductions will take place on april 1 2019 for those parties who have not yet ratified the cptpp it enters into force 60 days after the date on which that signatory has notified the depositary new zealand in writing of the completion of its applicable legal procedures the cptpp is a comprehensive agreement with 30 chapters 5 key highlights include digital trade e commerce the e commerce chapter seeks to facilitate business related data transfers and trade in digital products including by introducing i a prohibition on data localization measures ii a commitment to allow the

22 elements of the predecessor agreement and incorporates the rest eleven of the original 12 tpp signatories australia brunei darussalam canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam signed the cptpp on march 8 2018 after more than a year of re negotiation following the united states withdrawal although technically a separate treaty the cptpp incorporates nearly all of the provisions of the tpp as signed in 2016 by the original 12 parties including the united states except for a handful of provisions that the remaining member countries agreed by consensus to suspend 6 most of the suspended provisions had been inserted into the original tpp text at the demand of us negotiators to safeguard the interests of various domestic stakeholders covering such issues as market exclusivity rules for biologic dugs strict copyright enforcement priorities and investor state dispute settlement the cptpp text also incorporates a few technical and procedural provisions concerning such issues as accession entry into force withdrawal and authentic texts besides the suspended provisions the cptpp preserves all of the original and substantive tpp commitments in market access for goods services investment state owned enterprises government procurement and business mobility in other words all of the existing annexes from the tpp agreement remain unchanged and all tariff reduction and or elimination schedules services and investment liberalizations as well as market access for government procured works will take place as scheduled in the original commitments with a majority taking effect from day one from entry into force of the agreement there are also several bilateral side instruments or side letters which serve to complement and clarify the position among or between parties on specific issues of importance the final text of the cptpp agreement has been reduced from 622 pages to 584 pages with the removal of the suspended provisions which pursuant to article 2 of the cptpp will remain suspended until the 11 signatories decide otherwise by consensus the rationale for setting these provisions aside for later consideration and debate as opposed to completely removing them from the legal text was a negotiating tactic led by japan and australia aimed at leaving the door open for the eventual return to the agreement by the united states absent the united states signaling interest to rejoin and thus rekindling the incentive of preferential access to us markets it is unlikely that the 11 countries can or would indeed want to reach consensus on unsuspending any of the contentious provisions country specific implications each cptpp signatory has existing bilateral and multilateral agreements with some but not all of the other parties as the cptpp opens new markets and in some cases imposes new rules on domestic treatment of data intellectual property labor rights and more each party has a unique set of economic and political circumstances to consider a closer look at australia canada japan and mexico follows australia australia is already well connected among the cptpp parties having bilateral ftas with chile japan malaysia new zealand and singapore plus a multilateral deal with the association of southeast asian nations asean which also includes brunei darussalam and vietnam a deal with peru was signed in february 2018 but is not yet in force further trade liberalization among existing fta partners and the prospect of increased market access to canada and mexico however is significant the australian department of foreign affairs and trade dfat has specifically highlighted potential benefits for i exporters of goods including new reductions on japanese beef tariffs new access for dairy products into japan canada and mexico and elimination of all tariffs on industrial products ii exporters of services including the legal guarantee and enforceability of cptpp parties reforms in the professional services sector preferential temporary entry arrangements for australian workers and new opportunities for government procurement contracts in a range of sectors and iii australian investors including the introduction of higher screening thresholds for investments in mexico and canada the cptpp will impact key areas of trade and commerce across the australian economy the australian government has stated that it will help support australian businesses to grow and see annual benefits of up to 15 6 billion to national economy by 2030 state parties are required to reduce barriers to trade and foreign investment significant changes include the elimination of tariffs on aud 12 7 billion of australia s dutiable exports to countries party to the cptpp private foreign investment is projected to increase as the foreign investment review board firb threshold for private foreign investment is set to be lowered for signatories to the cptpp despite the anticipated benefits particularly for exporters in australia s critical agricultural sector some economists have estimated the ultimate real national income boost will be just 0 5 percent by 2030 the lowest of all parties however because of australia s established trade ties with the majority of cptpp members to not join the agreement would have meant ceding ground to the other parties many of whom will newly benefit from duty rates below those of australia s existing ftas canada compared to other cptpp members canada s existing network of ftas is relatively limited focused on its own hemisphere of the cptpp members canada has only completed bilateral ftas with chile and peru and is connected to mexico via the nafta while canada is negotiating deals with japan and singapore and is undergoing exploratory discussions with asean which also includes brunei darussalam malaysia and vietnam most of the trade relationships established by cptpp are new thus the cptpp represents a significant opportunity for canada to diversify its trade links and build stronger export markets in asia trade with the seven new fta partners was worth us 71 3 billion in 2016 more than total trade with mexico much has been made of the first mover advantage gained by the original class of six ratifying members who have the first opportunity to establish markets under the cptpp for canada this advantage is especially potent as it now enjoys newfound trade benefits in markets like japan compared to the united states which is now scrambling to establish its own bilateral agreement with japan it is especially incumbent on canada to diversify its trade network amidst uncertainty surrounding the future of nafta and its would be successor the usmca canada s food and agriculture industry in particular is poised to benefit gaining preferential access where it currently faces high tariffs such as in japan vietnam and malaysia in return canada will grant cptpp members tariff rate quotas trqs for its supply managed sectors including dairy poultry and egg products phased in over five years this issue has been a point of contention among canadian farmers who worry that increased imports into its managed sectors will threaten their livelihoods the government of canada cites expected benefits in the financial services fish and seafood forestry and metals and minerals sectors additionally the government has touted its success in negotiating the suspension of certain tpp articles on intellectual property and isds so that canada can maintain its current domestic regimes overall canada s gdp gains are estimated at us 4 2 billion higher than under the tpp because it is no longer competing with the united states under the same agreement japan following the united states withdrawal from the tpp in january 2017 japan drove the process forward to salvage the deal it would not have done so were the political and economic benefits not significant politically japan s role in realizing the cptpp positions it as a regional leader particularly vis à vis china the cptpp serves to set a floor for the anticipated us japan fta negotiations and could also give japan leverage in the midst of other ongoing negotiations including those for the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep economically japan is making a strategic compromise while some key sectors will take a hit agricultural forestry and fisheries output is expected to lose us 1 3 billion overall the economy is estimated to receive a us 71 billion boost once the cptpp is fully implemented of the cptpp members japan has existing economic partnership agreements epas with the asean countries brunei darussalam malaysia singapore and vietnam australia chile mexico and peru all but canada and new zealand mexico mexico s interest in becoming part of the cptpp process arose from a strategic view to strengthen trade and investment ties with the asia pacific region and raise the bar for its entire network of ftas including the nafta moreover and in light of existing uncertainty surrounding the future of its trade relationships with canada and the united states under the new and yet to be approved usmca mexico is seeking to rebalance its geopolitical interests towards the asia pacific region the cptpp allows mexico to have ftas with six additional asia pacific nations including australia brunei darussalam malaysia new zealand singapore and vietnam the openness of the cptpp process to allow membership to new potential candidates could also allow mexico to exploit new trade and investment relationships with other asian countries and latin american neighbors given the large and innovative scope of the cptpp as a new generation fta mexico will benefit not only from non tariff barriers with its cptpp partners but also from wide treaty coverage and strict protections in several areas such as digital trade regulatory coherence intellectual property rights ipr soes services labor and environment transparency and corruption the cptpp will support two sectors where mexico holds trade surpluses with cptpp partners automotive and agroindustry in other domestic industries where mexico holds significant trade deficits with cptpp partners e g footwear textiles electronics and pharmaceutical goods the challenge will be how to support domestic industries to adapt and face new competitors perhaps one of the strongest advantages of the cptpp for an emergent economy such as mexico will be to gain access to technology intensive manufacturing opportunities in sectors such as telecommunications digital trade and aerospace according to the mexican ministry of economy secretaría de economía se upon the entry into force of the cptpp over 700 mexican agricultural and industrial products will benefit from new market access opportunities under the agreement including mexican auto parts light vehicles electrical equipment medical devices electronic goods and a long list of fruits vegetables and other perishable goods such as meat poultry avocados and orange juice the cptpp also ensures protections to more than 14 mexican geographical indications gis for tequila

hearing process in december to assess the pros and cons of joining the cptpp however with national elections set for the first half of 2019 thailand s decision on whether to join will be deferred to the next administration completed a comprehensive feasibility study and public hearing process in december to assess the pros and cons of joining the cptpp however with national elections set for the first half of 2019 thailand s decision on whether to join will be deferred to the next administration the united kingdom in anticipation of its potential exit from the european union eu held a public consultation on whether to join the cptpp the consultation closed on october 26 2018 and the results are still unknown however it is unlikely that any decisions will be made until the uk s exit from the eu is complete in 2019 and the government considers its trade policy options on a holistic basis japan has been especially vocal in its support for the uk signing on it is also possible that china may consider joining the cptpp as a hedge against disruptions to its established trade network possible us reentry despite withdrawing from the tpp immediately upon taking office president donald trump has since publicly flirted with the prospect of rejoining the agreement were the terms substantially better than those negotiated by his predecessor while some lawmakers see the cptpp as having potential economic and geopolitical benefits president trump has focused on pursuing bilateral deals following the us midterm elections on november 6 2018 where democrats attained a majority in the house of representatives it is possible that trade policy priorities will shift slightly however even if house democrats are more inclined towards the cptpp than their republican colleagues it will not be a priority and it appears unlikely that the trump administration will be persuaded to revisit the tpp due to congressional pressure to the extent that democrats prioritize trade at all the focus will be the usmca and the proposed ftas with the eu uk and japan that said the speed with which the united states could potentially join the cptpp seek to improve the agreement or consider other options would depend on the terms and conditions of its accession the political and economic calculus also depends on which other countries move to accede option 1 cptpp if the united states were willing to accede to the agreement as is and based on its previous tpp market access commitments accession would likely face little opposition if any from the current cptpp parties this approach however would likely be opposed by us members of congress which must approve any signed agreement s implementing legislation these members could demand the reinstatement of tpp provisions on for example intellectual property or argue that the revised deal is inconsistent with related us negotiating directives set forth in trade promotion authority tpa us business community opposition might also be expected on similar grounds this option would also likely be politically impossible for president trump if the united states were willing to accede to the agreement as is and based on its previous tpp market access commitments accession would likely face little opposition if any from the current cptpp parties this approach however would likely be opposed by us members of congress which must approve any signed agreement s implementing legislation these members could demand the reinstatement of tpp provisions on for example intellectual property or argue that the revised deal is inconsistent with related us negotiating directives set forth in trade promotion authority tpa us business community opposition might also be expected on similar grounds this option would also likely be politically impossible for president trump option 2 cptpp plus the united states could instead seek to accede based on its previous tpp market access commitments but also request cptpp parties to unsuspend most or all of the contentious provisions and to reinstate some or all of the united states 53 tpp side letters while such efforts might be welcomed by cptpp parties there is no guarantee that the current members would quickly and consensually agree to reactivate the suspended provisions instead new negotiations would be likely thus raising significant domestic political concerns among certain cptpp parties whose citizens oppose for example us ipr policies or other trump administration positions e g steel tariffs there also is no certainty that the us congress would approve a new agreement or not demand additional amendments and concessions from the other 11 members something these other members would probably not welcome finally it remains uncertain how tpa procedures would apply to the new agreement given that the original tpp text has since been altered given the current administration s political need for some changes that they can claim are improvements to the original tpp such as adding some side letter sweeteners to give president trump political cover this option may be the most plausible at least during his presidency other global trade impacts as the us china trade war continues to escalate some cptpp members may be caught in the middle and can use the agreement to mitigate some potential economic impact for example vietnam s economy is highly dependent on exports a quarter of which go to china demand may slip especially for those goods which are re exported to the united states the cptpp then opens up new export markets and other opportunities smaller countries successfully integrated into us and or china linked supply chains have reason to be nervous as conflict between the world s two largest economies potentially leads to a

here s a wild statistic the 26 richest people on earth in 2018 had the same net worth as the poorest half of the world s population some 3 8 billion people that statistic which comes from the charity group oxfam is a bit of an annual tradition every year to mark the world economic forum in davos switzerland that yearly convocation of the world s richest and most self important plutocrats oxfam puts out a statement that the top people have the same amount of wealth as the bottom half as the center for global development s maya forstater and vijaya ramachandran once generalized it in 2018 x was equal to 26 and as it does every year the stat went viral this year oxfam s report added another shocking stat the report also claims that 2 200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12 percent which is eminently believable even as the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11 percent which is a bit harder to believe at a time when global poverty is consistently falling oxfam s the top x people have the same wealth as the bottom half claim has received plenty of scrutiny in the past from folks like forstater and ramachandran felix salmon chris giles and vox s ezra klein critics note that the oxfam data includes heavily indebted people in the rich world like a medical resident with med school debt as among the poorest people on earth which distorts the results oxfam for its part has responded forcefully to the criticism but the claim that the poorest people in the world have seen their wealth fall has gotten less scrutiny in both cases it s worth understanding a little better what the oxfam data does and does not say as well as reviewing other data on the state of global inequality oxfam is absolutely right that the rich are getting much richer but the world s poorest people are getting richer too the rich ultra poor problem wealth inequality is harder to measure than income inequality for a simple reason a lot of people have negative wealth in rich countries it s fairly common for people to have negative net worth when their student loans credit card debt underwater mortgages and the like are taken into account income can be negative too of course businesses that post losses have negative income for instance but it s not as common so in the credit suisse global wealth report which oxfam uses as its primary data source on the bottom half s wealth one observes a strange phenomenon the bottom 10 percent of the global wealth distribution contains a bunch of north americans and europeans whereas the next 10 percent contains barely any that s because americans with massive medical school debt or tens of thousands in credit card debt or to use the president as an example tons of debt from failed hotel casino and airline businesses wind up in the bottom decile some of those people like the person in credit card debt might be legitimately struggling but donald trump was not in any sense relevant to living standards one of the poorest people on earth when his net worth went negative in the 1990s you have to be very rich to get that poor and sure enough in 2015 oxfam s nick galasso conceded that the database they use included 158 million americans and europeans in the bottom decile that year galasso offered two defenses for using the data in this way while there are high debt but objectively pretty well off americans and europeans in the bottom decile they re only 23 percent of that group most of it is comprises people in poor countries who are struggling if you remove the bottom decile entirely from the bottom half of the distribution you get a similar picture as he wrote in january 2015 in 2014 he 2 8 billion people making up deciles 2 5 collectively own a mere one percent of global wealth about 2 6 trillion that s about the same amount of wealth owned by the richest 147 billionaires in the world 147 is a bigger number than oxfam s usual x amount because all that negative net worth in the bottom decile has been excised but it s still a startlingly small number those are both fair defenses i think it s not true that the bottom decile is just fake poor people in the rich world and it s true that global wealth inequality is massive but as the center for global development s forstater and ramachandran noted oxfam s defense smuggles in something interesting the richest 147 billionaires in the world control about 1 percent of global wealth that s way way more than the 0 000002 percent of the world s population they represent but it s not the case that a small handful of billionaires control most of the world s wealth what does appear to be true is that a small in global perspective number of millionaires control a shocking share of the world s wealth as this graphic from the credit suisse report illustrates 42 million people or 0 8 percent of the world s population have net worths in excess of 1 million that group roughly the global 1 percent controls 44 8 percent of the world s wealth so it really is true that a pretty small number of people control nearly half the world s wealth it s just a bigger small number of people than oxfam s reports tend to emphasize the falling wealth of the bottom half the more shocking part of the latest oxfam report to me was the contention that the bottom half s wealth fell by 11 percent whereas a few thousand billionaires saw their wealth increase by 12 percent the latter isn t too surprising billionaire net worths tend to be bound up in individual companies stocks and are thus incredibly volatile jeff bezos alone gained 24 billion in 2018 but the idea that the bottom half s wealth fell by 11 percent seemed odd to me it seemed curious to some development economists on twitter too half the world s population getting 11 poorer in a single year 2018 as claimed would imply a global economic catastrophe the likes of which we ve basically never seen people need to think about reasonable magnitudes before repeating made up stats jonah rexer xtrexer january 21 2019 laura rusu oxfam s policy and campaign media manager in dc told me that the group isn t sure why they observed such a large fall in the bottom half s net worth we don t have an explanation she says we ve been grappling with that we have hypotheses i m not entirely sure either but i have an alternative hypothesis the credit suisse report upon which oxfam relies relies not on purchasing power parity ppp a statistical tool that economists use in comparing currencies when what matters is how much stuff the currency can actually buy but on exchange rates which fluctuate often on a global market the latest credit suisse report also does some calculations using smoothed exchange rates which reduces volatility but nonetheless prefers exchange rates to ppp throughout when the financial times s chris giles looked into a similar claim oxfam made in 2016 he concluded that this exchange rate methodology accounted for the claimed fall in wealth of the bottom half of the distribution when the us dollar becomes more valuable relative to domestic currencies this shows up as a wealth decline even when there hasn t been a decline in living standards and sure enough in 2018 the us dollar appreciated against the nigerian naira against the south african rand and against the indian rupee given how populous those countries alone are and how poor their populations are it seems very possible that currency appreciation accounts for much or all of the decline that s especially true given that the credit suisse report came out in october before the dollar hit a bunch of setbacks i ve reached out to credit suisse s research team to see how much the bottom half s wealth would have changed absent any currency fluctuations update jim davies a professor of economics at the university of western ontario and one of the credit suisse report s authors stated in an email we don t think it is a good idea to focus too much attention on what is happening to the total wealth of the bottom 50 because that area of the world wealth distribution is less well known than the higher portion we don t know how oxfam got the 11 reduction he adds the change from q2 2017 to q2 2018 in our estimates was a drop of 8 6 and about half of that he roughly estimates was due to currency movements but the important thing isn t the year to year fluctuations for the bottom half of the wealth distribution he argues we think that the useful thing to know is that the bottom half almost certainly have less than 1 of the world s wealth davies wrote trying to say exactly by what their wealth changes from year to year is not very fruitful there is a large margin of error around any estimate of that oxfam s rusu defended the use of exchange rate data rather than ppp noting in the vast majority of countries but especially in developing and emerging countries a large proportion of personal wealth is in the hands of the wealthiest among the wealthy that is in households located in the first percentiles of the distribution these individuals tend to have great international mobility and tend to move their assets across borders frequently in that context what matters is their international purchasing power and measuring that in actual dollar values makes sense but this defense doesn t really hold when analyzing the bottom half of the wealth distribution or considering why the bottom half s wealth might have fallen according to the credit suisse data the bigger picture it s worth stepping back from the specifics of the oxfam numbers to try to answer the bigger claim that the oxfam statistics gesture toward are the rich getting richer as the poor get poorer the short answer is that the rich are definitely getting way richer and it s a problem but it s nonetheless also true that the world s poorest people are getting less poor you can see the latter phenomenon in a variety of statistics not least the world bank s estimates of how many people live on less than 1 90 a day this data is based on household surveys which take years to collect so it s out of date at any given time but economic growth in india china and even sub saharan african suggests that the progress continued through to the present day you also see this happening in the so called loch ness graph produced early last year by a team of economists led by facundo alvaredo lucas chancel and the famous inequality research trio thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman the chart shows how each percentile of the global income distribution saw its incomes increase from 1980 to 2016 there s a bulge at the left with people in poor emerging market economies seeing their incomes rise by 100 to 125 percent over those 36 years modest income growth in the middle including the poor and middle class in the us and western europe and then skyrocketing growth for the global 1 percent and especially the global 0 001 percent and global 0 0001 percent in other words what you think is happening is happening the rich really are getting preposterously rich and there s a real argument to be made the political argument that oxfam s statistic is meant to make that making taxes more progressive and directing the funds to say cash payments to poor households would lead to faster poverty reduction than has occurred under the current system one analysis suggests that up to 50 percent of global extreme poverty could be ended if developing countries adopted higher top tax rates but the rich getting richer doesn t preclude the poor getting richer too and while the middle classes in the us and europe have seen less income growth than either the poorest people in developing countries or the richest people on earth the world s progress against extreme poverty is real and notable it s also i d argued unhelpfully obscured by stats like oxfam s sign up for the future perfect newsletter twice a week you ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest

sen elizabeth warren d ma has declared her candidacy for president as the first name brand politician to have officially launched a bid she had an opportunity to set a thoughtful tone for the next two years of campaigning i think she failed let me be clear from the outset i m not comfortable with holding the democratic party to a good by default standard just because the republican party is currently controlled by a terrible president and warren s opening pitch points to a sort of populist political cowardice that sadly abnegates the responsibilities of real leadership especially when it comes to foreign policy here s the crux of the issue from her opening statement in foreign affairs u s trade and economic policies have not delivered for the middle class the trade deals both democratic and republican leaders negotiated mainly lifted the boats of the wealthy while leaving millions of working americans to drown policymakers were willing to sacrifice american jobs in hopes of lowering prices for consumer goods at home and spreading open markets abroad her message is simple the last few decades of u s economic policy abroad have been bad for the median voter most recently she opposed north american free trade agreement 2 0 arguing trump s deal won t stop the serious and ongoing harm nafta causes for american workers it won t stop outsourcing it won t raise wages and it won t create jobs what a tired pandering and backwards position warren a supposedly wonkish progressive champion has opened her campaign with a rejection of the international economic order warren ignores the indisputable fact that the deals she opposes such as those which enabled china s accession to the world trade organization have lifted around a billion people out of extreme poverty in our lifetimes and alleviated untold amounts of human suffering to warren this is an example of big bad politicians helping their rich cronies at the expense of american jobs how repulsively nativist i guess it would be one thing if warren were merely adopting a caricature of the idea that a nation must prioritize its own interests if there were a substantial economic threat coming from the outside world she d at least have a leg to stand on but she s wrong about the costs trade imposes on american workers and i suspect she knows she s wrong i put enough faith in warren s policy chops to believe that her obvious familiarity with trade shock literature extends to more than just evidence that trade is bad it s like saying she understands that car crashes are bad but doesn t understand how cars help people get to work and do other good things here s the truth literally none of the country s best economists think trade is bad for the country on net and no there s not room to resurrect the warren critique as just reasonable squeamishness about the redistributional effects of trade for one thing warren gave up that ground when she decided to oppose nafta 2 0 instead preferring no deal and a worse economy for another the changes in the income distribution that have impacted the working class are overwhelmingly the product of a different and far more important macroeconomic trend the fourth technological revolution the brookings institution calls this changes in the technology of production the new york times calls it automation finally and most importantly the assertion that major gains from trade do not accrue to the middle and working classes is an oversimplification so egregious that it borders falsehood if you only look for the costs of trade you will obviously discover working class job losses concentrated in industries that lose when competing overseas but these same data and methods can also tell you about working class job gains in industries that get to export and outcompete their foreign counterparts it turns out that simply adding this dimension to the most prominent studies trumpeting the negative impact of foreign trade shows overall modest job creation warren is wrong to suggest that ceos are the sole beneficiaries from trade gains because opportunity opens up everywhere take nafta the expert consensus is that the agreement has been modestly positive for the u s economy there have been about as many jobs created as lost and the new jobs pay 20 percent more when warren argues the agreement causes job losses and lower wages she flies in the face of facts what makes warren s shallow conjuration of an economic boogeyman lurking beyond our borders all the more disappointing is her conspicuous silence on real threats outlining her priorities in foreign affairs she mentions china nine times but only to gently tut at the nation not once does she discuss the million uighurs that have been imprisoned in detention camps under the chinese communist party s latest campaign of ethnic extermination she doesn t mention ukraine syria yemen north korea or any other country that engages in human rights abuses she bravely and briefly endorses the review of withdrawing u s forces from both afghanistan and iraq as though they were such similar situations that they need not require separate consideration look i get that warren has thoughts on all of the issues i m raising but it matters what issues she chooses to emphasize i am not satisfied by a foreign policy that s really just bad domestic economic populism in disguise this isn t leadership i sorely hope that the democratic party can field a candidate more willing to seriously engage with the president s principal constitutional responsibilities no one else in government can be commander in chief or negotiate treaties and so foreign policy is necessarily at the heart of what any candidate signs up for whether they appear to know it or not if not i fear that 2020 will be even more of a vacuous culture war than it has to be if candidates do the electorate the disrespect of following trump s lead into an ever less intelligent scrap for the approval of some imaginary lowest common denominator voter they will find themselves punished for inauthenticity leading from behind to paraphrase george bernard shaw we should know by now that

a security guard walks past in front of the bank of japan headquarters in tokyo japan january 23 2019 reuters issei kato by tetsushi kajimoto and daniel leussink tokyo reuters the bank of japan cut its inflation forecasts on wednesday but maintained its massive stimulus program with governor haruhiko kuroda warning of growing risks to the economy from trade protectionism and faltering global demand rising pressure from the trade war between china and the united states japan s biggest trading partners is adding to strains on the world s third largest economy and undermining years of efforts by policymakers to foster durable growth data earlier in the day showed japan s exports in december fell the most in two years to be honest if u s china trade tensions are drawn out there will be a serious risk to the global economy first to the two countries own economies kuroda told a news conference after the end of the two day policy review for now that possibility is slim and i hope they will resolve this soon as expected the boj trimmed its inflation forecasts reinforcing views that it will have to stick with its unprecedented economic support for some time to come advertisement advertisement but despite rising risks such as trade disputes and brexit the central bank also maintained its view that japan s economy will continue to expand at a modest pace kuroda struck an optimistic tone saying the economy would likely continue expanding through fiscal 2020 however a recent reuters poll of economists showed external factors have increased the chances of japan sliding into a recession in the fiscal year starting in april making it even harder for the boj to reach its elusive 2 percent inflation target china on monday reported its slowest growth in nearly three decades and it is expected to lose more steam in coming months the international monetary fund imf trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs amid the trade tensions advertisement advertisement such downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be heightening recently and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms and households sentiment in japan the boj said in a quarterly outlook report released along with the policy decision the boj reiterated a pledge to continue buying japanese government bonds and left its short term interest rate target unchanged at minus 0 1 percent it also said it would keep guiding 10 year government bond yields around zero percent story continues it will be difficult for the boj to discuss policy normalization or an exit strategy for the moment as risks from global economies are rising said hiroaki mutou chief economist at tokai tokyo research institute the central bank will likely save easing measures for later and it will examine how the fed policy movement will be and how it will likely impact the yen he said concerns about a global slowdown and volatile financial markets have prompted the u s federal reserve to take a more cautious stance on future interest rate increases after four hikes last year weighing on the dollar lower inflation forecast advertisement advertisement in its outlook report the boj s nine member board cut its economic growth projections for the current fiscal year to march but raised its growth forecasts slightly for the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 with government spending expected to offset the pain of a planned sales tax hike this october the boj cut its forecast for core consumer inflation to 0 9 percent in the coming fiscal year from 1 4 percent reflecting slumping oil prices it was the fourth downward revision by the central bank to its inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 since it was first issued in april 2017 that was still above a 0 7 percent forecast by analysts polled by reuters the central bank also trimmed core consumer inflation view for fiscal 2020 to 1 4 percent from 1 5 percent forecast in october advertisement advertisement many economists believe the boj s next move will be to start normalizing policy with steps likely to include expanding its 10 year bond yield fluctuation from 0 2 percent and raising the 10 year yield target from around zero percent a majority expect that would happen in 2020 or later as part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on a huge pile of cash the central bank decided to extend the deadline by one year for lending schemes aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost loans and support growth foundations the boj s radical stimulus program has had some unintended consequences as years of low rates hurt financial institutions profits advertisement advertisement the central bank has also amassed a mountain of japanese government bonds and exchange traded funds etfs in its marathon asset buying spree risking distortions in financial markets many boj policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus though external shocks or a sudden spike in the yen could force the central bank to do just that if the economy is at risk of sliding into recession reporting by tetsushi kajimoto and daniel leussink additional reporting by

like at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation rounded figures in million percentages based on non rounded figures sales by region emea western europe in 2018 the european small electrical appliance market grew more modestly on the whole than in previous years following a 0 7 downturn like for like in the fourth quarter the group posted a slight positive organic growth for the full year this performance is notably owing to a decline in loyalty programs lps and business activity in france performances were contrasted from one country to the next in france group sales were down 3 4 for the year with a 7 3 decline in the fourth quarter in the context of demanding 2017 comparatives 4 7 on top of a sluggish environment and difficulties in the offline retail industry the fourth quarter was impacted by the yellow vest demonstrations the latter affected the group s core activity including cookware ironing deep fryers and breakfast ranges and penalized a loyalty program nevertheless it should be highlighted that our recent innovations remain our main commercial successes particularly cuisine companion versatile all in one vacuum cleaners and the cake factory cake maker performance outside france was more positive in the german market less buoyant our core business excluding loyalty programs remained brisk fueled by our flagship products vacuum cleaners full automatic espresso machines optigrill and by continued growth in online sales momentum also remained solid in spain thanks to vacuum cleaners particularly versatile and robot models full automatic espresso machines cookware and wmf products and in portugal and italy where it was also boosted by loyalty programs the group achieved an excellent performance in the netherlands combining growth in core activity bolstered by new launches vacuum cleaners and a major end of year loyalty program lastly our sales were down in the uk owing to a complicated and lacklustre market ahead of brexit against this backdrop the group strengthened its positions in most western european countries other emea countries in the other emea countries organic sales growth came out at 12 5 for the year and 17 2 in the fourth quarter this solid performance was driven by practically all the major countries in the region and reflected in the overall strengthening of our market positions the negative currency effect which was substantial for the year as a whole and more limited in the fourth quarter led to offsetting price increases in several countries central europe played a key role in sales development in 2018 poland was a strong and steady growth driver throughout the year approximately up 30 like for like while romania and slovakia posted a very good year bolstered by a sharp acceleration in the fourth quarter the group also continued its rapid expansion in ukraine with considerable market share gains brisk sales growth was also confirmed in russia against demanding 2017 comparatives the main growth contributors were our usual mainstays notably cookware vacuum cleaners full automatic espresso machines and kettles wmf products also made encouraging headway thanks to extended distribution hence the group once again consolidated its positions in russia both in small electrical appliances and cookware in turkey in an economic environment that has deteriorated since the summer the group succeeded in maintaining a solid level of business activity while setting price increases to offset the weakening of the currency we continued to outperform a downwards trending market in volume in the fourth quarter thanks to the implementation of our growth drivers including a well balanced product offering combining innovations and a tactical line up of core range locally produced products at attractive prices as well as a multi channel distribution policy and gradual profitable development of wmf business in premium store networks while sales fell sharply in the middle east in a context of severe recession the group achieved an excellent year in egypt americas north america group sales were down 4 4 on a like for like basis after a stable fourth quarter the second half of the year was positive but failed to offset the shortfall posted at the end of june 11 5 in organic terms that stemmed from high 2017 comparatives in the united states and difficult business activity in canada generally speaking 2018 was a year of highly contrasted performances in terms of countries and quarters our business activity in the united states in 2018 was disrupted by difficulties in the retail industry resulting from the continued rise of online sales with its attendant effects on brick and mortar retail outlets an increase in promotional deals stock reductions store closures and bankruptcies in this context annual sales remained down following a fourth quarter that ended to be less penalizing the decrease resulted mainly from small electrical appliances despite very good performances in rowenta garment steamers with cookware sales t fal imusa all clad practically stable the retail sector is also massively transforming in canada where the strong trend in consolidation is ultimately reflected in heightened competitive and promotional pressure against this background the group ended the year with a substantial fall in sales despite strong performances in cookware in the buoyant mexican market the robust growth achieved in the quarter and for the full year was fueled by flagship products cookware blenders the confirmed strong debut of recently launched fans and the introduction of new filter coffee and espresso machine product listings with major customers these performances helped the group to increase its market share south america currencies continued to play an unfavorable role in sales in south america particularly owing to the continued depreciation of the brazilian real and the colombian and argentine pesos the sharp increase in sales in the fourth quarter results primarily from the recognition of a tax receivable in brazil amounting to 32 million excluding this non recurring item sales would be down 2 8 in the quarter on a like for like basis over the year the impact of all non recurring items in brazil tax receivable impact of a defaulting customer truck drivers strikes formatting of cookware production chain at itatiaia was marginal on sales development in south america in brazil after a period of uncertainty relating to the presidential election the macro economic environment is showing signs of improvement yet for the year as a whole the environment was volatile one of our customers defaulted and the competitive environment in small household equipment proved particularly harsh in cookware the slower than expected ramp up at the new itatiaia plant weighed significantly on our performance in small electrical appliances business was practically stable in 2018 but contrasted based on product category business activity increased slightly in fans in a market that fell sharply on the success of new silent and compact models as well as in food preparation notably thanks to the powermax blenders but decreased for beverage preparation devices dolce gusto and in linen care in colombia the group ended the year on a positive trend with a sustained sales dynamic against demanding fourth quarter 2017 comparatives and strengthened its leadership in cookware and small electrical appliances for the year as a whole we achieved solid and high quality growth driven in particular by fans blenders frying pans saucepans and pressure cookers in argentina in an environment that has worsened the downturn in our sales continued in the fourth quarter asia china in 2018 the group achieved an excellent performance postingvigorous organic growth quarter after quarter and constantly outperforming the market the remarkable vitality of supor s sales must be attributed to innovation an expanded product offering significant marketing and advertising investment as well as an effective on the ground execution in stores and online cookware business growth remained well oriented with as in the first 9 months a strong contribution from flagship product families pressure cookers pots pans and woks supplemented by the rapid growth of kitchen utensils and accessories thermal mugs in particular in small electrical appliances activity remained highly favorable with revenue growth in yuan of approximately 30 over the year driven by almost all categories in small kitchen electrics rice cookers electric pressure cookers mobile induction hobs kettles and high speed blenders and boosted by new models in addition supor has made rapid and continuous progress in non kitchen electrics with a threefold increase in sales in the fourth quarter in garment steamers and confirmed strong momentum in vacuum cleaners notably the versatile models large kitchen appliance business extractor hoods and gas stoves has also accelerated moreover the market welcomed supor s launch of a range of water purifiers e commerce whose growth is normalizing somewhat based on very high historical comparatives remained the main growth driver other asian countries excluding china revenue was up 7 on a like for like basis in the fourth quarter fueled by the success of our mainstays the continued expansion of our product offering and the opening of new proprietary stores japan malaysia taiwan and hong kong the more modest growth over the year 0 9 relates in particular to the non repeat of a wmf loyalty program in taiwan in 2017 in japan the solid sales momentum continued in the fourth quarter propelled by the confirmed success of our pillars cookware kettles and garment steamers but also by the more recently launched categories such as cook4me multi cookers in south korea our performance was also quite positive thanks in particular to further progress in home cleaning rapid increase in sales of the all in one air force 360 vacuum cleaner and in ironing freemove range of irons and access steam garment steamers which benefited from strong marketing activation conversely activity over the last three months continued to trend downwards in australia there was robust growth in thailand and malaysia driven by cookware and kitchen tools high speed blenders and steam generators simultaneously sales declined in vietnam as in the third quarter due to retail inventory reductions mainly of fans wmf professional professional sales coffee machines and hotel equipment totaled 635 million for the year up 14 3 like for like following an extremely strong fourth quarter with growth of 27 4 very similar to that in the third quarter in addition to the very good performance in our core business in germanic countries and internationally the strong acceleration in the second half of the year stemmed from the delivery of major coffee machine contracts signed at the start of the year in the united states and china a further large contract was signed with another american customer deliveries started in the fourth quarter and will be stepped up in 2019 in the hotel equipment business sales for the year were slightly down outlook the solid sales momentum in 2018 and less unfavorable currencies effects than expected allow us to generally confirm the group s operating result from activity orfa

particular in china and hong kong yen is trading as the weakest one for the moment partly also thanks to boj s sharp downward revision in fiscal 2019 inflation forecast swiss franc follows as second weakest on the other hand new zealand dollar is boosted by better than expected cpi data which reduces bets on rbnz rate cut australian dollar follows as second strongest but aussie s recovery similar

worries that inflation outlook is worsening and chance for a rate cut by rbnz is reduced majority of economists are still expecting the next move to be a hike but for now there is no time frame for that move yet meanwhile the outlook is still clouded by fading momentum in the economy as show in recent forward looking indicators there is question on whether domestic inflation could sustain and should data ahead disappoint there bets on rate cut will re emerge wh kudlow denies cancelling meeting with china reiterates importance of enforcing promises there were rumors that trump s administration declined or cancelled a second deputy level meeting with china on trade the meeting was intended for preparation on the top level meeting between us trade representative robert lighthizer and chinese vice premier liu he there were various versions of the rumor but the key message was that the us is not satisfied with the lack of concrete progress on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer china s offer to buy more goods from the us is simply not enough but white house economic advisor larry kudlow came out denying the rumor and said there was no cancellation and he maintained the high level meeting later this month between lighthizer and liu was very very important and determinative and there were no other intermediate meetings scheduled while the story is unchanged we are moving towards negotiations yet kudlow also emphasized that enforcement is absolutely crucial to the success of these talks promises are great but enforcement is what we want things like deadlines and timetables and full coverage of the various structural issues he said will this all be solved at the end of the month i don t know i wouldn t dare to predict us senate to hold competing votes to end government shutdown the us senate will hold two competing votes on thursday as effort to end the record government shut down trump s plan which includes usd 5 7b for border wall will be voted on also democrat s proposal to reopen government through february 8 will also be voted on it s seen as a concession by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell who previously refused to vote on a bill that trump would veto trump includes a provisional three year work permits for the youngsters under deferred action for childhood arrivals program as bargaining chip but his plan is still likely to be voted down as democrats have open rejected to compromise on the issue the democrats could gain enough support from senate republicans rebels to vote for their proposal which was already pass in the house however even so trump will likely veto even if the democrat s bill is passed in the senate the democrats are way short of two third majority to override trump s veto so the shutdown might still extend beyond thursday looking ahead uk cbi trends total orders is the only feature in european session later in the day canada will release retail sales us

resistance from there to limit upside at least on first attempt for now further rise is expected as long as 1 2668 minor support holds even in case of another retreat but break of 1 2668 support will argue that such rebound is completed and turn bias back to the downside for retesting 1 2391 low in the bigger picture whole medium term rebound from 1 1946 2016 low should have completed at 1 4376 already after rejection from 55 month ema the structure and momentum of the fall from 1 4376 argues that it s resuming long term down trend from 2 1161 2007 high and this will remain the preferred case as long as 1 3174 structural resistance holds gbp usd should target a test on 1 1946 first decisive break there will confirm our bearish view however sustained break of 1 3174 will invalidate this case and turn outlook bullish economic indicators update

before going through our results in detail i would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter equity markets had a mixed impact on us during the quarter end of period markets were unfavorable on a year over year basis with the s p 500 and msci eafe indices declining 6 2 and 13 4 respectively on a sequential basis both indices also declined with the s p 500 down 14 and the eafe down 12 5 also on a sequential basis the average daily market value of the s p 500 was down 5 1 while the eafe declined 6 3 however as you will recall some of our fees are based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter the s p 500 was up 7 2 while the eafe was up 1 8 short term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the federal reserve currency rates influenced the translation of non us currencies to the us dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses the british pound and euro versus the us dollar ended the quarter down 6 and 5 respectively compared to the prior year the british pound and euro also declined sequentially the year over year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the us dollar had an unfavorable impact to revenue and a favorable impact to expense let s move to page three and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter year over year revenue increased 5 with non interest income up 4 and net interest income up 9 expenses increased 2 from last year the provision for credit losses was a credit of 4 million compared to a credit of 13 million one year ago net income was 15 higher year over year in the sequential comparison revenue increased 2 with non interest income up 2 and net interest income up 3 expenses increased 2 compared to the prior quarter net income increased 9 sequentially return on average common equity was at 17 for the quarter up from 15 1 in both the prior and prior year quarter assets under custody and administration of 10 1 trillion declined 6 compared to one year ago and were down 7 on a sequential basis assets under custody of 7 6 trillion also declined 6 compared to one year ago and were down 7 on a sequential basis both the year over year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter assets under management were 1 1 trillion down 8 year over year and down 9 on a sequential basis both the year over year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows which include the impact of lower period and security of lending collateral and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates let s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1 5 billion up 5 from last year and up 2 sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were 934 million in the fourth quarter up 3 year over year and down 1 from the prior quarter foreign exchange trading income was 78 million in the fourth quarter up 24 year over year and up 9 sequentially the year over year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function as well as increased client volumes and higher volatility the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher volatility other non interest income was 75 million in the fourth quarter up 4 compared to one year ago and up 36 sequentially the year over year increase was primarily due to a net gain on the sale of non strategic leases in the current quarter partially offset by lower treasury management fees and securities commission and trading income the sequential increase was also due to the net gain from the lease sale combined with an impairment recorded in the prior quarter as well as a lower visa related swap expense net interest income which i will discuss in more detail later was 430 million in the fourth quarter increasing 9 year over year and up 3 sequentially let s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five for our corporate institutional services business fees totaled 536 million in the fourth quarter flat year over year and down 1 on a sequential basis the translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year over year c is fee growth by approximately 1 5 and the sequential growth by just under 1 custody and fund administration fees the largest component of c is fees were 376 million up 2 compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis both the year over year and sequential performances were driven by new business partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rates and markets assets under custody and administration for c is clients were 9 5 trillion at quarter end down 6 year over year and down 7 sequentially both the year over year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in the currency exchange rates as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter recall that lagged market factors value into the quarter s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our c is custody and fund administration fees investment management fees and c is of 105 million for the fourth quarter were down 1 year over year and down 3 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily due to net outflows partially offset by favorable markets and a change to gross revenue presentation the sequential decline was primarily due to outflows assets under management for c is clients were 791 billion down 9 year over year and down 10 sequentially both the year over year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates securities lending fees were 22 million in the fourth quarter down 14 year over year and down 10 sequentially both the year over year and sequential performances were impacted by lower volumes as well as lower spreads securities lending collateral was 150 billion at quarter end and averaged 158 billion across the quarter average collateral levels declined 9 year over year and 7 sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were 398 million in the fourth quarter up 6 year over year and flat sequentially within wealth management the global family office business fees increased 7 year over year and were up 2 sequentially the year over year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets the sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business recall that our global family office fees are impacted by quarter lagged market values within the regions the year over year growth was driven by higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard new business and favorable markets sequential performance within the regions was relatively flat as the unfavorable impact of lower equity markets was offset by new business assets under management for wealth management clients were 279 billion at quarter end down 4 year over year and down 6 sequentially moving to page six net interest income was 430 million in the fourth quarter up 9 year over year earning assets averaged 112 billion in the fourth quarter down 1 from the prior year total deposits averaged 93 billion and were down 4 year over year interest bearing deposits declined 2 from one year ago to 74 billion non interest bearing deposits which averaged 19 billion during the fourth quarter were down 10 from one year ago loan balances averaged 32 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 5 compared to one year ago the net interest margin was 1 52 in the fourth quarter and was up 13 basis points from a year ago the improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short term interest rates partially offset by higher premium amortization and a balance sheet mix shift on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up 12 million or 3 average earning assets declined only slightly on a sequential basis as deposit levels were only slightly lower than the prior quarter on a sequential basis the net interest margin increased 5 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short term rates and a favorable balance sheet mix as we have discussed in our most recent quarters we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function this activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to central bank deposits as we swap out of us dollars but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income for this quarter we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of 17 million offset by 14 million less in net interest income looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter us dollar deposits represented 70 of our total deposits this was equal to one year ago and up from 69 in the prior quarter turning to page seven expenses were 1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 2 higher than both the prior and prior year quarter as previously mentioned the current quarter included 5 7 million in expense associated with severance and other charges for comparison purposes note that one year ago our results included severance and other charges of 17 6 million as well as 12 9 million expenses related to a special one time cash bonuses paid in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act the prior quarter included 2 7 million in severance and other related charges excluding the called out charges expense for the quarter was up 5 from one year ago with respect to the remaining increases in year over year expense growth the following items were key drivers within the categories compensation was higher primarily driven by increased incentive compensation and this year s base pay adjustments which were effective in april the impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts employee benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses and higher payroll tax withholding partially offset by lower medical expenses compared to the prior year outside service costs were higher driven primarily by higher third party advisor fees and increased technical service costs expenses partially offset by lower consulting expense there was a corresponding increase to trust investment and other servicing fees as a result of the higher third party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation equipment and software expense was up year over year due to a software related charge higher software amortization and higher equipment related costs occupancy related costs were lower compared to the prior year primarily relating to non recurring lease adjustments recorded in the prior year other operating expenses were down from the prior year primarily due to lower fdic expense and staff related costs partially offset by higher cost associated with account servicing activities shifting to the sequential expense view excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter expenses were up 2 for the prior quarter compensation expense increased sequentially due to higher cost associated with performance based incentives salaries and other compensation costs employee benefits expense increased primarily due to medical costs outside services increased sequentially due to higher legal and consulting costs and higher technical services expense partially offset by lower sub custody and third party advisor fees the sequential increase in equipment and software was primarily attributable to a software related charge other operating expense declined 8 million from the prior period driven by lower business promotional spending due to the timing of the northern trust sponsored golf tournament during the prior quarter and lower fdic costs partially offset by various other miscellaneous expense categories including cost associated with account servicing activities staff levels increased approximately 4 year over year and 1 sequentially the staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations which include india manila limerick ireland and tempe arizona partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations turning to page eight as we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing 250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020 concurrently we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach we expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth our fourth quarter results reflect approximately 36 million in expense savings reducing the year over year expense growth by approximately three points this would equate to approximately 145 million on an annualized basis against the 250 million goal we continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities turning to the full year our results in 2018 are summarized on page nine net income was 1 6 billion up 30 compared with 2017 and earnings per share were 6 64 up 35 compared with the prior year on the right margin of this page we outlined the non recurring impacts that we called out for both years we achieved a return on equity for the year of 16 2 compared to 12 6 in 2017 full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page 10 trust investment and other servicing fees grew 9 in 2018 the growth during the year was primarily driven by new business favorable markets the acquisition of ubs fund administration businesses in luxembourg and switzerland and the impact of revenue recognition foreign exchange trading income increased 46 driven by an increase in swap activity within our treasury team and also growth from the client driven trading net interest income increased 13 the growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short term interest rates coupled with earning asset growth the net result was 11 growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2018 on a reported basis expenses were up 7 from the prior year adjusting for the expense charges in both 16 and 17 that are on the prior page expenses were up 8 from 2017 reflecting the ubs acquisition the underlying growth within our business and the impact of revenue recognition turning to page 11 our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns this slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pre tax margin and ultimately our return on equity the ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131 in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pre tax margin and ultimately our return on equity turning to page 12 our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13 7 under the advanced approach and 12 9 under the standardized approach the supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7 and at the bank was 6 4 both of which exceeded the 3 requirement became applicable to northern trust effective at the start of 2018 with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio northern trust is above the applicable 100 minimum requirement as northern trust progresses through fully phased in basel iii implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final basel iii rules yesterday we announced a 0 05 increase to our quarterly dividend from 0 55 to 0 60 this represents a 9 sequential increase and an increase of 43 on a year over year basis during the fourth quarter we also repurchased 2 5 million shares of common stock at a cost of 235 million now i would like to turn the call over to mike for some closing comments michael o grady president and chief executive officer thanks biff good morning everyone before we open up the call for questions i wanted to offer some closing comments regarding 2018 the three primary objectives for our strategies are to continuously enhance client service improve our productivity and grow profitably in 2018 we executed multiple initiatives and made significant investments in order to make meaningful progress on all three objectives for example we executed on an important initiative to realign some of our operations and technology functions in order to enhance the client experience by better aligning ourselves and our activities with client needs in our business strategies we can see early benefits of this realignments as we can effectively and efficiently serve clients end to end and be more nimble in this rapidly changing environment as biff highlighted we have made considerable progress toward our value for spend goal of achieving expense run rate savings of 250 million by 2020 throughout the company we ve made a commitment to making a value oriented mindset and ongoing aspect of how we conduct our business we re investing meaningfully in technology in our talent in wealth management we are expanding the capabilities of our goals driven wealth management platform and we continue to hire talent in focused growth areas in asset management we expanded our product offerings including the development of new etf and alternatives products and in c is in conjunction with the integration of the ubs asset servicing acquisition in europe we are investing heavily in building a future state fund services platform and we strengthened our technology capabilities by acquiring or making investments in becs lumin parallax and c tech our shareholders benefited from the execution of our strategy through the company s financial performance and return of capital in 2018 as we begin 2019 we re excited about our competitive positioning within each of our businesses we remain focused on providing clients with exceptional service improving our productivity and driving profitable growth thank you again for participating in northern trust s fourth quarter earnings conference call today biff mark and i would be happy to answer your questions april you can open up the line questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and we ll first hear from michael carrier of bank of america michael carrier bank of america analyst hi thanks guys biff maybe first one just for you when you mentioned some of the lagging pricing on some of the assets and just given the period end you just wanted to get maybe an update on how you re thinking about the expense the outlook for 2019 and beyond you gave the update on the value for spend but just how it maybe a lower revenue environment can you dial areas back versus what you re going to kind of remain in investment mode for longer term growth stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah mike maybe it d be helpful on the call if i walk through the lag in the lag impacts first and then we ll talk about the expense reactions to that because i think there are some important information here first if you look at our fees as a firm if i look at our c is business first i ll start there approximately 60 of the fees are equity market sensitive or sensitive to asset they re asset sensitive they re they move with markets and so 40 down if you look at our custody and fund administration line then for those that are sensitive about 70 to 75 of our fees are on a month lagged basis okay that means 25 to 30 are on a quarter lag basis in the past i know we ve talked more about 50 50 in that lag but our mix has shifted between our global fund services business at our traditional iit business inaudible institutional investor businesses and so that is more of a 75 70 to 75 is on a month lag and 25 or so is on a quarter lag in our custody and fund administration fees in c is investment management fees which about 40 of the fees are sensitive to equity markets about 50 is daily but the vast majority of that is in cash funds about 40 is quarter lagged but more heavily exposed to equity and then 10 or so is on a month lagged basis if you go to our wealth management business it s more aligned with where we traditionally talked it has not moved as much but roughly if you look at our global family office about 65 to 70 of the fees are quarter lagged 25 of those percent are daily 25 is daily and 5 to 10 is in a month lag and then if you look at our wealth management regions about 70 are on a month lag basis 20 are on a daily basis and 10 are on a quarter lag basis i hope that s important for everyone so they can understand sort of the lag nature of our business for fees to give you some color i think the rest of your question was really then around the with that kind of backdrop what can we do from an expense standpoint and i ll take a quick stab and mike might have a few comments that he wants to add as well from an expense standpoint the first thing i d say is we continue to focus as a firm on the organic trajectory of our businesses so that s important to us what we think we can grow organically and what we can grow our expenses organically but we re not immune from considering the macro factors in our expense run rate as well the way we look at it is this we have certain inflationary pressures on our expense base but we think about generating productivity through things like value for spend or other forms of productivity that has to at least offset that inflation in our model that leaves us with expenses in our view that are there to support the organic growth rate that i talked about and or to invest in our businesses and we calibrate those so that we generate organic leverage from what we think we will get on the organic growth rate so that s the framework we think about expenses and we do think that if we get that right we drive the productivity and drive the productivity as hard as we can that we can still create that leverage even in an environment where we do see some volatility on the fee line or volatility in the markets michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah i would just add to what biff said that over time we have the financial models that biff described there and so it s important that we continue to execute on that over time having said that you also have to navigate the environment that you re in at that particular point in time and clearly the environment right now is more volatile than it was say a year ago and so that does mean being very careful in thinking about how we manage the expense base for the business as we go through this market environment so being relatively tight if you will as we go through that and focusing on these longer term productivity initiatives that we ve had in place importantly as biff talked about a year ago or before that the environment was relatively strong and that s when we launched into value for spend and the point is that we didn t want to wait for a more challenging environment to say ok now we need to come up with ways to reduce the expense base so it s both through cycles if you will but then also trying to be mindful of the environment that you re in michael carrier bank of america analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe just a quick follow up just on the organic growth outlook i think you guys have been in that call it 4 to 5 range overtime given what you re seeing in terms of the investment opportunities and maybe some of the competitive dynamics in the industry like are you still comfortable with that type of outlook just given some of the dynamics in the industry has anything i guess changed from that perspective michael o grady president and chief executive officer why don t i start with this it s mike so from an organic growth perspective we still are targeting the range that you talked about there and i would say right now in the past year we were toward the low end of that range and there s a number of dynamics around that and maybe just to break it down a little bit by by our businesses starting with asset management i don t need to go through all the dynamics facing that business but that s a business that has seen its organic growth rate come down and in the past year basically we were flat as far as organic growth in the business so a little bit negative on flows and picked up a little bit on fee realization through mix but essentially at flat that s going to dilute the overall organic growth rate for us if you look at the asset servicing part of the business which has been growing at a higher organic growth rate it continues to grow at the same level that it s been at in 2018 it was again toward the lower end of that range but if you think about that it s being roughly half of the fees and the range for them being 5 to 6 overtime and toward the lower end still a healthy rate for that business and i d be glad to kind of break that down further as to what we saw in 2018 and then the wealth management business again different set of dynamics which i won t go through but has been at a lower organic growth rate and so even separating out the impact of asset management products in that business the fee organic fee growth rate has been more on kind of the 2 to 3 range for that and we were roughly in that range for the year so when you do the weighted average of that that s where you come out to again toward the lower end of what you re talking about but if you said strategically what are we trying to do well we re trying to execute on strategies and target markets where we think that we have an opportunity to maintain that growth rate operator next we ll hear from brennan hawken of ubs brennan hawken ubs investment bank analyst good morning thanks for taking the question you spoke to the lag effect which is helpful to get a refresher on in great depth thanks for that biff just curious if you could comment on the fee rate so we saw it rebound from the third quarter where you had some transactional headwinds thinking about that looking forward how should we consider fee rate in each of your businesses might the lag effect that you walk through not only have an impact on the calculation of the auc dynamics and aum dynamics but also the fee rate and how should we calibrate that as we move into 2019 thanks both considering the drop in 4q and then the rebound here quarter to date that we ve seen in march mark bette director of investor relations hi brennan it s mark i ll take a first shot of that part of it would be the when you re doing the true average of september 30 to december 31 auc a or even aum in wealth management you are picking up at end of period number that s going to be lower for the asset even though the fees haven t fully reflected that yet we did see in the fund administration under custody and fund administration we did see a little bit of a pickup from transactions that would have helped there as well moving forward and as we ve talked about that it s a really as that the custody and fund admin ph is a tough one to look at fee rates just because of the mix of businesses that you bring on and that every asset is not equal so it s really about bringing on services doing as much as you can for every dollar of asset on the wealth side i would say as we ve talked about before if you looked at the regions within wealth management split let s say roughly evenly between product asset management and the advisory fees the advisory component has actually held up pretty well and we look to stay competitive in that area and then on the product side we haven t quite seen the declines that we ve been seeing and if you went back 18 months ago or so but overall i think part of the fee realization might be the fact that the assets are fully reflecting in the fourth quarter markets whereas the fees don t quite maybe have that yet brennan hawken ubs investment bank analyst okay so maybe we re going to be looking at some fee rate pressure that s subject to a lag that it seems like that s what you re saying there mark thanks for that and then i wanted to circle back on on the expense question mike it seems as though you had said that and it seems like this is a bit of a different approach than what we ve heard from northern in years passed is that while you guys came up with your values for spend program making hay while the sun was shining so to speak as you enter into a period where you have a potentially more volatile equity market environment maybe less helpful better tailwinds you are going to be diligent in investments and the expense line so as to adjust for potential headwinds that might come through is that a fair conclusion there or am i reading too much into what you said michael o grady president and chief executive officer well i m not i m suggesting that you read more into it that s what i m saying having said that i do think that s a fair characterization so we recognize the importance as i said of just continually improving our productivity so it s not a good market bad market thing and that s why we wanted to put more i d say structure and focused around value for spend going back a year or plus ago in addition to that though when you answer in environment like this just as you said i think it s a good point there are other expenses that are discretionary if you will so the level of investment spending that you re making theoretically you can say well we re just going to flat out invest through the cycle we re not pulling anything back and on the other side you can say we re going to completely pull back on all investments in order to just get the expense growth rate down and i think you hit on it when you said yes we can look at those categories and say not just whether we re going to do them but what is the pacing for that do we need to see a little bit more into 2019 before we continue on certain investments and there s sorry for the expression but there is no such thing as a free lunch if you a delay on something well you re delaying on something and if you don t make that investment well then you re taking the risk for future revenue so those are the type of decisions that we have to make but it is acknowledging that we do have discretion around those so let s try to manage those for the environment that we re in as well operator next we ll hear from alex blostein of goldman sachs alexander blostein goldman sachs co analyst thanks hey good morning everybody question for you guys around pricing terms in the servicing business obviously i m sure as you heard from inaudible last week sounds like the pressure has accelerated on a bunch of parts of the ecosystem here so curious what you guys seeing in terms of pricing institutional servicing there s always been obviously the mix is different and also there s also been some element of pricing pressure but really just trying to get a sense of whether or not you re seeing any acceleration and kind of pricing degradation here and then separately can you help us get a flavor for the makeup of your customer base with c is between us non us asset managers hedge funds et cetera michael o grady president and chief executive officer sure alex it s mike i ll start off so the way i would characterize the environment that we ve been in and i think we re still in is an environment where there is more activity and what i mean by that is whether it s asset owners or asset managers for different reasons are definitely looking at what they re doing and how they re doing it and there are implications from that so what does that mean on the asset owners side of the equation you have very large asset owners that have managed their capital or their investment in a certain way in other words have they completely outsourced it to external managers or have they done some internally and frankly we re seeing those types of organizations look at going both directions and we ve seen the impact of that so some of the larger ones saying we re going to do more in house because we think that s a better way for us as a scale manager of investments when they do that they have different data needs and different capability needs so a lot of time spent around the technology and what we can provide to them apis i think database things like that and again depending on what you can offer versus competitors et cetera it can change the dynamic but there s more activity around that second i would say with other asset owners they ve actually looked at it the opposite way and we saw some of the impact of that in 2018 where as an asset owner that has done more in house they ve said frankly that s not our business if you will in other words large corporate pension plan saying we re not going to continue to operate a large in house investment team instead we re going to go more external we re going to go more passive that s lower cost and our objective is to get to the right answer for the client and so in doing that these are still clients but what we do for them is less and we will see some fee impact from that as you shift to asset managers there has been a lot of discussion on obviously the pressure on asset managers and therefore their primary objective of looking at the cost of these types of services they ve also when their asset base they ve seen the cost go up in an absolute dollar perspective so they do look to see if they can reduce costs there are different ways to get there whether it s just negotiation with their provider or do they go out and do just an rfi or do they go to rfp and what are the results of that so as a result of all that i would say more activity now if you looked at 2018 for us as a result of more activity i would say our gross business one if you will was toward the high end of the rates that we have been at so in that sense good number the net as i mentioned before toward the lower end of the range and then if you say ok how do you break out the negative or the lost business in that the largest portion of it so say in the neighbourhood of 3 from a rate perspective was more toward lost or repositioned and i should add into that certainly you see flows change in the impact of flows so if we re the custodian for a very large sovereign wealth fund that we do it for equities and they switch out of equities then we re going to see the impact of that so you did see more funds flow and more activity there when you say lost business did you lose a lot and why did you lose it again i would say every situation a little bit different in certain cases do we lose through the process because the competitor does a better job it certainly is going to be the case we d like to win them all but we don t win them all and obviously we re up against the best in this business and at times could it be because of pricing and that they ve either to retain the business they ve gotten very aggressive on pricing or in this case to win it away that s certainly part of it but i would not tell you that we ve seen overly aggressive pricing by competitors in order to win business on i would say it s consistent with where we ve been we ve tried to be very disciplined around our own pricing and again i would say that we ve seen some impact but not dramatic so when you take the kind of repricing component it s going to be more in the neighbourhood of 1 5 to 2 of what we saw this year from a rate perspective so you re going to have that as you mentioned all the time in the marketplace whether it s a little bit higher or lower but for us i wouldn t say that part of it has been dramatically different and then i m going to let mark address the second part of your question mark bette director of investor relations yeah as far as the mix when we look at c is and you re right we don t publish the actual segments within c is but when we look at it roughly about half of c is is the fund services business which is where our asset managers would be and that s we don t break out that between traditional but within that you have traditional asset managers you have hedge funds you have private equity funds i would say that our gfs business is larger in emea than in the united states so that hopefully gives you some flavor for the makeup of the fund services alexander blostein goldman sachs co analyst great that s very helpful thanks guys and then my second question just around expenses maybe frame it a little bit differently but i guess if i look at your core expense base in 2018 net of these severance charges in the couple of things you highlighted it looks like we are running a little bit below 4 billion and assuming that you kind of continue to aspire to grow the business organically and kind of the 4 to 5 range is that a fair way to think about the growth and expenses of that sub 4 billion number for 2019 michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah at the highest level alex i would say yes so in other words that we re responsible for all the expenses right so we could we do break them down and cut them every way you could possibly think of but at the end of the day we re responsible for all of them we aspire to do a little bit better than that number in the year from an internal target perspective mystify a little bit for various reasons not from a value for spend or productivity perspective but from some of the other things that biff mentioned in his commentary there but that s kind of the base if you will and then going forward again it should be aligned with the organic growth rate in the fees and so to the extent we can stay in the range that we talked about from a fee growth perspective then yes then that s what you would expect from an expense perspective to the extent that that goes down for whatever reason then we have to look at how do we bring that organic growth rate on the expense side down with it operator and next we ll hear from glenn schorr of evercore glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks michael o grady president and chief executive officer hi glenn glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hello just one little follow up on the pricing discussion has anything dramatically changed in terms of client contracts in other words like the public money coming up every year or two and the rest of the world having five to seven year role so maybe something like 15 to 20 of clients come up each year is that am i in the ballpark on that michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah glenn i would say for certain clients you do have i ll call it more locked in term that s generally where there is more of an investment upfront for the on boarding but in most of these contracts there is generally a notice period six months notice or something like that so we re not counting on just the contractual term and the fact that they would be locked in and i would say this is particularly with some of your more traditional asset management business i they have the ability to accelerate it so has that gone has that sped up a little bit again i haven t looked at anything analytically but as i mentioned before i think we ve just seen more activity as they ve looked at their situation i ll call it glenn schorr evercore isi analyst and maybe you could talk to the good part of growth in your in response from i think it was mike s first question you talked about that 4 to 5 asset growth and you dangled a little bit of if you want more i ll give you more on what clients are driving could we talk a little bit about what clients are driving it michael o grady president and chief executive officer well if i understand the question just peeling it back level as to where we re targeting in order to have a higher organic growth rate maybe starting with the asset servicing business we have benefited from our focus on alternative managers so for us particularly hedge funds and our hedge fund services business has grown at a higher rate and again we ll continue to focus there and we think there is opportunity in the other parts of the alternative space for us both for the market itself but then for our position there we also believe on the asset owner side with what we would call the more complex asset owners so this is to my previous comments about asset owners that are doing more asset management if you will on their own they tend to be asset owners that have high allocations to private to some extent hedge fund but also significantly in private equity infrastructure et cetera they have a different set of needs and therefore we ve been focused on how can we meet those needs with technology and a service model and you saw the investment we made in a technology company that was part of it that was really to join up with what we ve been developing on our own but we see greater growth in that segment i thinking about luxembourg obviously we did the acquisition there but the fund services markets both ireland and in luxembourg are both healthy but i would say for us in particular luxembourg has been and we think will grow at a higher rate for us just given our position there which is lower position and now moving up in the ranks there and we did see that and then just shifting over to wealth management on the wealth management side again we think that our value proposition resonates particularly well as the level of complexity goes up for the client or the prospects so ultra high net worth when i talk about goals driven wealth management the platform that s behind that the technology that is geared more toward the ultra high net worth and so we ve seen a higher level of growth in that area and we ll continue to do it and then likewise you see the numbers in global family office and i ll say that s beyond just keep doing a good job there s been some very specific strategic initiatives in that business that are working very effectively so in particular we looked at the technology there and we upgraded our technology offering both the ability to do partnership accounting just being a little bit technical but then also what we can offer as far as analytics so we have something called anchor analytics that again is resonating very well with existing clients but also prospects and then i would just also say in wealth management from a market perspective we ve talked many times about certain markets where we have lower market presence like in new york like in texas where we see higher growth rates for us and that s not to diminish the growth from some of our more mature markets like florida here here in the midwest and then just to close out in in asset management a significant focus around the areas again where we think we can grow faster like etfs and quant active which are not the larger parts of our assets under management base but where we see greater growth potential for us so hopefully that gives you some of the areas that we re focused on operator next we ll hear from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi good morning so wanted to start off with a question on the securities portfolio you mentioned the duration of the securities book very conservatively believe the duration now is just a little above one year and with the conversation now shifting from fed tightening to likely fed pause and there i say even fed easing cycle i was wondering whether you might consider locking in some duration or maybe mitigate some of those nii pressures in anticipation of possible fed using in the future stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah steve thanks this is biff so the answer to that is we have our asset liability committee meets regularly and frequently and what you just described is a key input to our decision making and certainly an item that we re considering given the balance of risks now between future rate increases and either no rate increases or even a reversal of the trends we had we do that on a regular basis we have that conversation at all times and we ve benefited as you see from the growth in our net interest income over time from that short duration but internal debates and views on what may happen in the future is something we consider as a general rule over time we ve always had a reasonably short but there is the ability to look at how we want to position and i can assure you that is actively discussed and regularly discussed internally and will continue to be and as we look at what is i think now a more balanced picture in terms of what may happen in terms of fed future fed increases and or at some point maybe even a reversal of that trend but we re certainly looking at it and you can see those kinds of things in some of our disclosures in the qs and ks where we look at the sensitivity of net interest income to those factors steven chubak wolfe research analyst understood and just one follow up for me on capital management one of your peers recently increased our capital return with a mid cycle ask you guys have incredibly robust capital ratios i m just wondering if that s something that you would consider pursuing and maybe any insight into how you are thinking around long term capital targets has evolved i know you tried to stay at least in the ballpark with some of your peers that you compete with for rfps from the looks of things are actually above many of those peers today i m just curious how you re thinking about managing to an explicit long term capital target or what you think is a reasonable expectation from here stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so with regards to well first of all we did a dividend increase yesterday which was something that we had had in our capital plan as from last year not public here until yesterday but we did do that but the way we think about capital and the way the firm thinks about capital is first do we have enough to support our growth second do we have enough to support ourselves through times of high stress do we have enough to maintain very high ratios and ratings and then do we have enough to support a competitive position in the marketplace so that we can compete against others to win that business i think the answer to all of those is yes that we are strongly and well capitalized at this position and so as we think about entering the capital planning cycle and the submissions are due first part of april we enter those from a position of strength that gives us a great deal of flexibility in our thinking and we do look at the competitive environment in terms of where we are that s one of the four items i just highlighted for you do we think about our position vis a vis the others but we think we re very well capitalized right now and are focused on thinking that through and our capital ask at the regulators in terms of what we ask kind of in the mid period at this point we think we ve got a plan at this point in time that we re going to continue to execute on in the remainder of this quarter and the remainder of the second quarter and will submit in april but it is it s a strong position that we enter the capital planning cycle and submission from and it allows us to think about our returns with great flexibility operator brian bedell of deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks for taking my questions maybe just to circle back to wealth management mike i think you ve said that right now that organic growth rate is low is low single digit in the 2 to 3 area maybe if you can just talk about whether you think that s more of a regional focus in terms of improving that or rather more of the capabilities that you re talking about and then also just what the client behavior is trending like in wealth management given we re seeing more volatile markets and moving more to cash and then can you accelerate your own investment product within the open architecture platform across that business michael o grady president and chief executive officer okay brian a couple embedded ones in so make sure i get on hit on all of them as far as the growth i would say i m going to call across the business so both within the regions but also in global family office i did highlight some of the things we re doing in global family office but that s not to say that that s the only area where we see opportunity to increase that organic growth rate and in fact when i talk about goals driven wealth management ultra high net worth that s in the region if you will so good opportunities across the markets and when we look at trying to increase that and i would also just say part of that is i m going call it addition through subtraction just meaning we have a higher gross new business rate it s just that you also have to deal with the flows and people pay their taxes and things like that nets you down to that 2 or 3 so we re trying to just get to the best net number that we have that we can get i think the second part was just about client behavior and i would say you re absolutely right when we talk about volatile markets et cetera the first thing that we think about is how do we make sure we re very close to the client and i d managing the situation with them and i would say so far that we haven t seen a lot of dramatic behavior or changes and i would say that that s particularly because that s the driving objective behind goals driven wealth management is keeping them focused on what are their goals what are their objectives and we ve put together a portfolio that support those goals and it gives you the ability to go through volatile situations like this without being over reactive and quickly moving out of equities only to then miss the opportunity when it goes back up again i will say in addition to that we do provide our strategic and tactical allocation portfolios from asset management to our wealth management clients and they do tactically move in last year i think appropriately and move to more of a neutral position earlier in the year and then more recently in the beginning of this year moved back to a more balanced position by increasing the allocation to risk assets so once again trying to see through cycles for our clients but then also being mindful of what s happening on a tactical basis as well brian bedell deutsche bank analyst are you able to get more of northern trust investment managed product within that asset allocation performer are using or you re using more of an open architecture approach michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah so i would say everything i talked about there is agnostic to the product at asset management itself northern trust has is certainly trying to develop products that meet the needs of clients but that s the only time that those two would come together so i talked about etfs and being focused on etfs part of the success there is they ve designed products that we think meet with the goals and objectives of our clients but it s that direction if you will i ll call it top down not something the other way operator betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning how are you michael o grady president and chief executive officer hi good morning stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so just a couple of follow up questions here i heard earlier about the conversation around price pressure 1 5 to 2 in line with what you ve been seeing for a while now i guess i m wondering if you could give us a sense mike what that range of pressure is on and just a couple of key either client types or product sets that you offer i guess i m thinking that maybe it s a little bit heavier on some of the more equity mutual funds and it might be lighter if at all on alternatives but maybe that s wrong i d just like to get your sense on that michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah betsy so i m not going to be in a position to give you a product by product breakdown on where they are more or less i mean i think in general as i said it s more about activity than it is about everybody just driving to lower cost per se and as much as we know that there s a lot of pressure on asset managers and maybe you would say particularly certain categories of traditional asset managers that doesn t mean that a hedge fund is not focused on their expense base as well it s probably more acute in the traditional asset management space i would say that but i know that doesn t mean that we re immune in other categories as well and as i mentioned on the asset owners space as well they certainly do look at the fees that they pay in order to custody and administer the assets and so it s not again just an asset manager phenomenon it s something that you have to anticipate which once again goes back to if you know that that s going to be the case overtime what do you do strategically and i think importantly the first thing we do is we want to make sure we re providing value right because the value is going to support the fees that you re paying it s also going to lock you more into that client relationship then we re also going to look at productivity both in general as i talked about but within the client how can we be as productive as possible and sometimes it goes the other way which is to look at the value we re providing look at the fees we re getting and frankly if it s the other direction then we have to have that conversation with the client about the fee that they re paying relative to the service that we re providing to them so i know that doesn t necessarily give you the specificity that you re probably looking for but that would be my perspective betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst got it i know you can t give i was just looking for whether or not there was a range we could talk about but i get your point i guess the other question i had mike was just on in the conversations you re having with both existing and prospective clients what do you see as some of the biggest pain points that clients have frictions to solve that you re focused on addressing say over the next year or so michael o grady president and chief executive officer so if it s institutional clients i would say that on the asset owners side the primary pain point is around data right and so they re primarily trying to assess and determine for themselves what is the appropriate data model for them to have data operating model and when you say well what does that mean well it would be easy to say i want perfect data that s real time i we can provide that essentially but in providing that that is a higher cost model to be able to provide that to them as opposed to a model that is either on a daily basis or some other basis ok and the point on that is it s worthwhile for the client if they are actively managing their investments so higher cost but they would view it as more than make up for it because we are actively managing the assets and that could be either directly in the market investing it could be active with managers and it could be also what we would consider overlay strategies right where they want to be able to quickly shift their asset allocation but to do that they need essentially real time information in order to be able to do that now as i hopefully laid out there there is a spectrum there of both what the needs are and what we can offer and so it s not a one size fits all for all of those clients and that s the dialog so with each client you really have to assess where they are and what they are trying to achieve and then as a result do they have the right offering for them and then i would say on the asset manager side this is where we re investing significantly in our fund services platform meaning both fund accounting and transfer agency to really make that much more of a digital experience for the client and if you think about what we re doing there we re helping our clients being the asset manager service their clients and so they are trying to provide a digital experience to their client while they can t do it unless we can provide it to them as well so that s where the investment has been in trying to solve that pain point if you will for their dealing with their client so hopefully that s helpful betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst very much thanks operator ken usdin of jefferies has our next question ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks hey guys if you don t mind i might just clean up a couple of questions biff you mentioned in your prepared remarks when you re talking about the auc that the quarter you had a transition out of a large custody client i know just wondering can you help us try to understand of the 7 decline roughly just how much of that was and if in fact the revenue from that client was also already out of the quarter s run rate stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we referred to one large client transition out during the quarter you re right and that was it was a us large corporate client and that was primarily a us corporate cash custody relationship when you look at it in our trend report i think glenn you ll be able to see that the drop of about 91 billion that you ll see in auc in fixed income within c is that s a reasonable indicator of the magnitude that s a pretty good explanation of that and then in terms of the fees michael o grady president and chief executive officer it s partial stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer it s partially yeah it was partially transition so there it was partially it was that s what mark has talked about not all auc is created equal and there is different fee structures associated with some of that so but it was it makes enough movement in the fixed income space that we called it out here ken usdin jefferies analyst understood ok and then just a couple of little ones there are a couple of good like pluses and minuses throughout the fees and expenses and i m wondering can you help us to the extent you can clarify what the leasing gains software charge and the magnitude of what it sounded like a little higher servicing errors perhaps on the other expenses it seem like there was some lumpy stuff and a bunch of items any help you can help us in trying to get some starting points thanks stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you can on the leasing side in the quarter there was approximately 5 million worth of the gain and we didn t call that out explicitly because over the course of the year there are gains and losses of that in the quarter and interestingly enough over the course of the year they kind of wash through so we at that magnitude haven t necessarily called them out given their size on the expense side the items that i would call out on the software charge that we talked about if you look at the sequential increase for us which i believe was just under 7 million in equipment and software i think it s fair to say that that was essentially all attributable to the software charge so that gives you some idea of the magnitude of the charge but it was largely that was driven there and then in terms of the cost associated with client servicing we tend to look at that line item which is you know sits in other expense over the course of the year it is fair to say that in this quarter that was higher than our normal run rate and meaningfully higher than that but if you look at that line over the course of the year it reverted closer to where we see it it was a little higher we called it out and the fourth quarter was indeed higher but hopefully that gives you some color on what those were inside of other expense which is a compilation of a lot of different moving parts we had fdic expense move in our favor by let s say 5 million to 5 5 million in the quarter but we had these larger expenses associated with servicing clients meaningfully above the run rate the normal run rate in there more than offsetting that and then we have a lot of other items like value added tax that kind of all moved that item around i think it s probably better to look at other expense over the course of the year and look at the average of those run rates operator next we ll hear from jim mitchell of buckingham research james mitchell the buckingham research group analyst hey good morning maybe just a question on the balance sheet and deposit flows it seems like noninterest bearing and interest bearing both kind of stable quarter over quarter you do you think the flows the outflows particularly noninterest bearing are starting to come to an end should we start to think about deposit growth yet or is do it is still think given where rates are that deposits continue to trend down just wanted to get a sense of how you re thinking about it stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we did see the stabilization particularly in the non interest bearing line item from the in the quarter i think it was down about 200 million so essentially a flat noninterest bearing movement and as we discussed last quarter when we look at that bucket and the nature of the makeup for that bucket we think that a lot of the most rate sensitive money had already sought other return seeking products whether those were within northern trust or somewhere else so we feel reasonably confident that bucket has reached at least a current level where rates are right now and in particular if we don t have any future rate hikes we think that there could be some stability in that in the interest bearing portion of the deposits while it was flattish from what you can see here there was some movement down and interest bearing that we then can bolster with wholesale funding or others not a lot a little over between 1 billion and 2 billion we view that more as normal operational movements that we would see among our clients as they reposition their portfolios reposition their cash that is much more a function of the interest bearing to us is much more a function of the growth of our business where we growing our asset servicing relationships and we just generally see our balance sheet grow can we see deposit growth i think we can see deposit growth if we see our asset servicing businesses continue to grow and our wealth businesses continue to grow we should be able to see that counterbalancing that is any actions that may be going on among the fed in terms of the tone balance sheet management activities which can put some pressures on it but generally we ve seen now a couple of quarters of some balance sheet stabilization in terms of balances james mitchell the buckingham research group analyst right and if as we think about continued organic growth in that mid single digit range that s kind of where you d like you think that sort of an intermediate term goal in terms of deposit growth stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer it s not always one for one on that in terms of the balance sheet growth because it depends on the nature of the the organic fee growth we re getting for instance we could win fund administration and other type businesses where we don t necessarily have the custody and we may not actually get balances the comp but we get fees so it isn t necessarily one to one with that but it is growth where we get traditional auc there s generally some balance sheet growth that could come with that so i don t know that i would quite put it if the peg it at the levels you talked about but it could grow from there james mitchell the buckingham research group analyst okay thanks operator brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey good morning guys stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning michael o grady president and chief executive officer good morning brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods inc analyst a quick question on if the fed does pause given where we re at with the deposit pricing and those kind of seeing some upward pressure there i mean if the fed doesn t move next year do you still think that you can see some margin movement i mean just assuming that the balance sheet stays flat or we at this point in the time you re almost liability sensitive stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah if all things being equal here if everything else is equal we do think that there could still be some nim expansion with no fed rate hikes but the pace of that growth and the pace of that we ll be subject to the asset repricing that we have we still have some assets that will roll some of that need to be repriced so we do think there could still be some nim expansion but probably get a more measured pace in terms of liability pricing with no future fed rate hikes we don t see at this point a meaningful need to continue to have see upward pressure on deposit pricing there might be some modest amounts somewhere in the portfolio on the margins but not broadly across the portfolio we think we re at or near market competitive levels brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay and this is a separate one on taxes looks like you ended the year kind of a low point for the tax rate and that s excluding the some of one timer that you called out already in the presentation how you think about the tax rate down as you go through 2019 that we re able to adjust your go forward tax rate down because of the guidance at the choice ph you put out thanks stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i still think at this point in time the 23 to 24 range that we ve given you is where we would suggest you think about our 2019 operator next we ll hear from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you guys share with us you ve talked about biff transitioning some folks into lower cost markets from your higher cost labor markets how much more can you do that i mean are your 50 there 90 there were there s not much more you can do in transitioning people into these lower cost markets michael o grady president and chief executive officer i m glad to start on that one gerard so i think it s appropriate observation in one that we ve had for some time because it has been a it has provided a significant benefit to us over the last several years i mean going back 12 years 13 years ago when we first started what i would consider location strategy to actually move functions into different geographies and that has matured over time how we think about that so biff in his commentary had mentioned some of the different locations those locations are not all the same so what we do in bangalore for example is different than what we may do in manila or what we do in limerick or tempe and so we ve evolved it in that way the third thing i would say is that we ve been growing as we ve talked about we have a higher growth rate in our businesses in particularly in asset servicing which requires more people for it and so really what it s enabled us to do as opposed to moving positions over it s that we essentially absorb the growth in those locations and then to kind of wrap up with the answer to your question there s still opportunity both because of the growth and where it happens but also certain functions that still have not fully matured into where their appropriate location is but acknowledging that and saying well then what does it mean if you re closer to the end i ll call it of location strategy and then the beginning and that s why we talk about automation and robotics and what we can do from that perspective and we have a number of initiatives under way that are part of value per spend where we are looking to automate the functions as opposed to necessarily moving them to a different location and the view is that that creates even more scalability than in our model gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good then as a follow up mike you guys obviously are very well capitalized you ve had a successful acquisition strategy over multiple years of buying different businesses and integrating them into your organization as the markets remain maybe more volatile pressures on revenues are across the board does it make sense to look at acquisition opportunities maybe in a more heightened fashion or maybe that hasn t changed and you have been looking you just haven t really found anything michael o grady president and chief executive officer so as we ve talked about on the call we re all very cognizant there are a lot of negative aspects of volatile or down markets and having said that as biff articulated well with regard to capital now is a particularly good time to have a strong capital base and is part of the strategy with regard to capital because it does provide us the flexibility in these types of conditions to both be more opportunistic to your point on acquisitions if they are attractive for us and to be able to have the flexibility around our capital returns so the answer is that we yes we are always looking at acquisitions that can accelerate our strategies and often we re not able to execute on those because of the market i e high valuations and then you are presented with the opportunity because of the environment that either strategically competitively certain companies may have issues that then present themselves as opportunities for us or from a pricing valuation perspective it just becomes more attractive operator next we ll hear from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi whether you intended to or not i think you re coming across a little cautious on this call so i just wanted to ask you was that your intention going into the call and specifically when you add it all up do you guys expect to show revenue growth faster than expense growth in 2019 and your roe target i m not sure if you updated that are not but it was 10 to 15 and you reported 16 in 2018 so is there caution is that the reason why you re not raising your roe target or am i just missing something here thanks michael o grady president and chief executive officer sure it s mike i ll address both of those so first of all as far as the tone we didn t come in with an objective for a particular tone this is just the way that we re looking at the business and the environment et cetera but needless to say i mean i would say we re certainly optimistic about our position from a competitive perspective and our ability to serve clients and to continue to grow and produce attractive returns for our shareholders more specifically to your questions with regard to organic growth fees and expenses i would say in 2018 the objective was to have those in line as we ve talked about and we came up a little bit shy of that so we did not meet our target now almost were there and there were certain aspects of as to why that happened and again we own all the expenses so it s more reasons as opposed to excuses and then coming into this year absolutely the objective is the same on an organic basis now there s a lot of things we can t control we talked about the markets how it effects our fees things like that but the view is if we can produce it on an organic basis and you have a year like 2018 that produces i think 1 6 points of fee operating leverage so that remains the same and that s our objective and then as far as roe we haven t changed the range per se but i would definitely say that has not limited us in our aspirations or targeting so we had 16 this year and certainly are not afraid to target for ourselves doing better absent knowing what is going to happen in the environment and i would say now it s a particularly difficult time to say all right should you recast the range when part of the reason why we re above the range frankly is because of tax reform a year ago which boosted the roe hopefully that stays in place but again there is nothing certain on that front and then also the markets and everything we ve talked about here we tried to have a range that was through the markets hopefully we re not at the top end of that for it but we don t find the range itself to be constraining on our activities or aspirations and finally i would say for shareholders we re trying to produce the most attractive combination of growth and returns so as i ve said many times if it was just about the returns there is probably some things we could do to pull back on spending and investing and things like that and in the short term get it up but over the long term not create as much value for shareholders and so how do we make sure we re balancing growth with returns particularly when we re at a relatively attractive levels stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and whether if i could add here i would say mike tonally there was no preview of let s have this be cautious what it was is us just talking about the environment we re operating in right now but i think as mike said he is optimistic about the positioning of our businesses and the opportunities to grow organically and i would say he and i are both and the board and everyone is equally optimistic about the financial strength with which we entered this period of uncertainty and volatility we have a strong balance sheet we have good liquidity and we re well positioned to take advantages of the opportunity that type of volatility can put in front of us so whether you call that caution or optimism i think that gives us a great array of opportunities but we are entering a period of time that looks different then say previous five six seven eight year positive equity run and at least the last three or four with upward sloping rate likelihood so i there was no intention to be tonally cautious just factually the environment we re operating in but business positioning i think mike and i would both agree financial strength and strategic product and execution strength are pretty high michael o grady president and chief executive officer our objective is to deliver on the results stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah mike mayo

last october philip hammond the uk chancellor of the exchequer in the annual federal budget speech to the uk parliament said this austerity is coming to an end but discipline will remain talk about orwellian doublespeak the truth about austerity is that it is a means of social control or as hammond put it discipline hammond s recent comment is completely illogical austerity is economic discipline really it s just a way of making the poor suffer more while continuing to bail out the rich every time they implode the economy it s rare that the titans of finance slip up so well and so egregiously with their language but it happens this being an excellent case study now we know straight from the source just what economic experts being mouthpieces of multinational corporations really want just as much or even more than austerity discipline or another way of putting it they want austerity except we aren t supposed to realize that we live in austerity anymore or at least don t try and resist these people want a normalization of austerity until we just accept that this is the way it is a cursory look at the upcoming uk budget shows more of the same billions to update the nuclear weapon systems continued cuts for many government ministries cuts to scotland when considering inflation rates a cap on total welfare spending with a few crumbs for their universal credit benefits etc all of this is happening while homelessness is rising dramatically up 169 since 2010 so what kind of discipline is mr hammond really talking about a writer for vice one simon childs succinctly summed it up in the end spreadsheet phil went with austerity is coming to an end but discipline will remain so it s not over it s coming to an end at some point but discipline will remain for which you can read austerity so really that s austerity is coming to an end but austerity will remain if that sounds contradictory that s because it is austerity is a decade long ideological project which has seen poor and working class people pay for the financial crash through cutting the supposed largesse of the welfare state the government is trying to loosen spending up a bit while the effects of that project become even more stark as many commentators have pointed out austerity is not based on any rational sense of finance or macroeconomic forces it is an ideological mission a moral argument stemming back to the puritan calvinist and social darwinist worldview if you re poor it s your fault and all one has to do is pull oneself up by your bootstraps societal and systemic forces which consistently lead to high unemployment substandard education lack of social support structures and stagnant wages are never addressed what better way to keep people disciplined than to offload public spending onto the citizenry thus forcing private citizen especially the poor and middle class to pay more for essential services this has predictably led to an explosion in college and personal debt the super ego always judging itself produces a type of mental enslavement and has now engulfed the globe in late stage capitalism we are taught to always blame ourselves because we are not marketable don t keep up with technology aren t innovating or learning life skills to keep up in a gig service economy with rising rates of poverty which also is hollowing out all social forms of purpose and collective belonging the us educational system is complicit in this since this is the first public institution most of us enter a regimented oppressive nightmare of one size fits all deluges of mostly useless information where children are always competing and one upping each other with grades achievements etc as long as we were obedient little drones who raised our hands to ask questions sat when told to repeated the pledge of allegiance every day and in general were with our parent s complicity spoon fed lies omissions and distortions of historical scientific and sociological facts we could one day participate in adult life successfully of course the more obvious sites for adult coercion and brainwashing barely need mention jails churches mental institutions large corporations federal bureaucracies etc the history of public education in our country is a history of indoctrination or something worse of which the horrors are so great they cannot be put into words if one examines the african american or indigenous histories of schooling modern schooling is freaking twelve years of boot camp for the adult world of bio psycho social alienated labor there is no use denying or getting around this fact the psycho somatic beatings endured become embedded in our minds and the trauma is relived and has been passed down generation to generation this has created a militaristic society yet also a pacified and slavish one which submissively bows down before capitalist imperialist colonialist systems of hierarchy we are the docile bodies that foucault spoke of we ve been molded for the purpose of fitting into increasingly mentally damaging forms of labor the stress of daily work in the us has almost completely precluded any serious resistance i cannot stress this enough as bodies synchronizing the finely tuned engine of capital we are poised to destroy ourselves and the majority of species on the planet if we continue down this path once again surprise surprise the language we use has been beaten into us and is a formidable weapon in the arsenal of capital there s a humorous anecdote in this monthly review article by rebecca stoner spotlighting john patrick leary when general motors laid off more than 6 000 workers days after thanksgiving john patrick leary the author of the new book keywords the new language of capitalism tweeted out part of gm ceo mary barra s statement the actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile resilient and profitable while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future she said leary added a line of commentary to barra s statement language was pronounced dead at the scene as stoner explains when it comes to words like entrepreneur when we talk about entrepreneurs with an uncritical acceptance we implicitly accept view that wealth was created by entrepreneurs via a process of innovation and creative destruction rather than marx s belief that wealth is appropriated to the bourgeois class by exploitation this is why i always think of don miguel ruiz s first agreement be impeccable with your word so phillip hammond was being perfect with his wording really he wants discipline dammit others take a more well mendacious approach to their phraseology when people say that jail will rehabilitate prisoners or that innovation increased productivity and hard work will provide the tools to lead a 21st century economy i am skeptical especially with regard our carceral industrial complex how obviously and openly corrupt and racist the prison system is in our country where length of sentences are absurdly long compared to other nations and rates of jailing are exponentially higher for black and brown peoples with 10 cent an hour wages metered out for a smoke snack foods or a cell phone call while the largest corporations make billions off of what amounts to slave labor which mind you the chinese have been replicating with the uyghur population in xinjiang province i d rather those in power tell us how they really feel in a lecture on nietzsche with a nod to foucault rick roderick put it quite well the idea that we would send someone to prison in order to rehabilitate them now we re getting to be more honest about that we re getting a little more barbaric and for nietzsche that d be better it d be a little more honest we re sending them to prison because we re scared of them and we know if they go there really bad things will happen to them and it will ruin their lives and that will make us happy that s what we should say when we send one to prison that is what it comes down to for today s centers of power kill jail torture or condemn those lower on the totem pole to lives of penury marginalization and unpleasant labor the chthonic chant from trump s base is connected to this impulse lock her up build the wall whoever you can t control so easily ply them with media drugs fame money power this is how the system was designed from the early days of the enlightenment as foucault asks rhetorically in disciple and punish the birth of the prison is it surprising that prisons resemble factories schools barracks hospitals which all resemble prisons architecturally one of the more famous blueprints for constant surveillance interrogations examinations and constant monitoring of the social body came from bentham s design of the panopticon we notice the ones under surveillance or even those who think their being watched increasingly self censor and self monitor themselves to avoid untoward further investigation or physical violence from state authorities whether inside an institution or outside in the public sphere rather than rehabilitation the modern notion of discipline is to induce punishment and goshdarnit our culture sure does know how to punish those less fortunate on any given year between 10 and 20 million people worldwide die of starvation even as silos of food lie full all over the usa and europe preventable childhood diseases kills perhaps another 10 million kids a year a mobilization of food medicine and competent medical professionals along with a logistics network to access hard to reach rural areas in the global south could solve these crises within a short time frame today we see disciplinarian methods used as a general principle a blunt instrument applied to daily life where conformism homogenization and compliance to authority dictate modern culture in work and the home also people avoid vocalizing their internal critiques of the state authority or the economy for fear of social reprisal becoming an outcast and basic issues of self survival in minority communities under attack from police brutality in an atmosphere of generalized anxiety suspicion and paranoia here we begin to uncover the archaeological or rather genealogical evidence and the ideological underpinnings of centers of power ideologues economists and capitalists do not need to explicitly promote austerity they can just change the name but they do need a certain type of discipline and the contrived system of artificial scarcity which keeps the multitude desperate this destructive economic system which we dub neoliberal stymies thought kills dreams exploits labor and reaches into all facets of political and daily life in such an authoritarian state today just as in ages ago women and children bear the worst forms of abuse and punishment even as they do most of the work either unpaid in the home or in professional employment women still must deal with performing emotional labor for men in the west that have not self analyzed and cannot see how they directly benefit from patriarchal institutions of power that filter down into the workplace community home etc the sociological make up of the middle classes constantly under threat of falling into penury until european and north american capitalist states underwent a significant shift in the late 19th and 20th centuries constant competition the modern factory and striving for status and material affluence shifted the previous belief in a protestant work ethic towards one of social darwinism and from there to a consumer based age of affluence where the might of economic powers to exploit becomes an inherent right where monopolistic corporations use advertising to continually encourage consumptive addictive and childish behavioral patterns coupled with eugenics and the westward spread of us territories under the ideology of manifest destiny the genocidal policies of social darwinism and racist medical practices spread worldwide the professional classes were fascism s most slavish disciples medical doctors joined the nazi party at a higher rate some say 7 times the rate of joining as the average job than any other profession in germany the harsh unrelenting regime of discipline inherent in such bourgeois values creates a new form of human behavior and outlook towards society one which erich fromm called the marketing orientation as he wrote the mature and productive individual derives his feeling of identity from the experience of himself as the agent who is one with his powers this feeling of self can be briefly described as meaning i am what i do in the marketing orientation man encounters his own powers as commodities alienated from him he is not one with them but they are masked from him because what matters is not his self realization in the process of using them but his success in the process of selling them both his powers and what they create become estranged something different from himself something for others to judge and to use thus his feeling of identity becomes as shaky as his self esteem it is constituted by the sum total of roles one can play i am as you desire me it is worth remembering that mainstream economists such as philip hammond or before him fools such as milton friedman or alan greenspan in the us are not basing their budgets or speeches or interest rates or stupid powerpoint presentations for corrupt elites on any rational model any shred of common sense to help working classes or even middle class citizens these people are pr spokespeople for capitalists nothing more they are as the multinational corporations and financial sector desire them we are all sort of becoming who the centers of power want us to be pliable obedient cowed desperate also more hardened isolated commodified and easier to control the social conditioning is so deep here in the us when philip hammond says discipline will remain the capitalist and colonialist policies he and his elite associates pursue have global consequences the effect of his words may be hidden from many western eyes but they are not any different from the direct violence in previous eras of the corrupt town sheriff the racist prison warden the sadistic psychiatrist the violent headmaster of a school the conquistador the slave owner the ss officer this is in fact exactly what modern day discipline is words ideas images stock markets debt ratios and the concepts of the ruling classes become material life threatening issues which undergird our system of artificial scarcity the spreading of this dark cloud of western civilization with all the concomitant issues of technology worship reification and commodification of the human spirit and creativity continues to tell us be disciplined be rational be good citizens even to be human in a specific sense passed down by enlightenment figures it is unsurprising that many decades ago the first theoretical models for the post human age were underway since the beginning of the so called anthropocene era we have seen how the artificial divisions of nature and culture have been exposed even today much postmodern art and critique which opens up new avenues for research by exploring ideas surrounding intersubjectivity depthlessness waning of affect etc still indulges in the fantasy of isolated separate urban centered and rational humans as a given despite the push by liberal democracies to spread a certain type of modern propaganda reminding us of our so called secular materialist cosmopolitan consumer society the urge for spirituality for raising of consciousness still remains strong in contemporary culture via the rapidly expanding interest in yoga meditation mindfulness practices psychedelics another term is entheogens and even paganism in the west yet even many of these basic self exploratory and self coping mechanisms are increasingly and continually mediated through corporations or at least small businesses and hierarchies at the expense of cooperative and communal forms of organization what i think would be beneficial for people to think about is a return to a notion popular in 60s counterculture the idea of a new sensibility or sense abilities as it were readers may know about the ideas of fury generated towards its most vocal theoretical promoters susan sontag herbert marcuse norman o brown i believe it would be worthwhile to revisit those concepts in his speech liberation from the affluent society marcuse said let us give one illustration of the need for such a total rupture was present in some of the great social struggles of our period walter benjamin quotes reports that during the paris commune in all corners of the city there were people shooting at clocks on the towers of churches palaces and so on thereby consciously of half consciously expressing the need that somehow time has to be arrested that at least the prevailing established time continuum has to be arrested and that a new time has to begin he continues this situation presupposes the emergence of new needs qualitatively different and even opposed to the prevailing aggressive and repressive needs the emergence of a new type of human with a vital biological drive for liberation and with a consciousness capable of breaking through the material as well as ideological veil of the affluent society society has invaded even the deepest roots of individual existence even the unconscious of man we must get at the roots of society in the individuals themselves who because of social engineering constantly reproduce the continuum of repression further on he states to give sensitivity and sensibility their own right is i think one of the basic goals of integral socialism they presuppose a total trans valuation of values a new anthropology we may say that today qualitative change liberation involves organic instinctual biological changes at the same time as political and social changes no longer subject to the dictates of capitalist profitability and of efficiency socially necessary labor material production would and could become increasingly scientific it means that the creative imagination would become a productive force applied to the transformation of the social and natural universe quite clearly and perhaps being a tad self conscious he later says and now i throw in a terrible concept it would mean an aesthetic reality society as a work of art indeed marcuse goes on to cite in the western tradition hippies diggers and provos as groups we can think of many more today especially indigenous cultures who offered a new sensibility against efficient and insane reasonableness it is intense social engineering and insane reasonableness which we are loath to stand up against due to our own relative affluence today that affluence is disappearing especially in the developing world as climate change and ecological devastation threatens all in the west the stores may be open and the planes may run on time but late capitalism is running on fumes the veil remains along with elitist media manipulation which distracts and diverts public attention but various anti capitalist forces are arrayed at its edges preparing to draw in the masses discipline has been unmasked for what it really is a one way ticket to an early grave for the poor or a lifetime of spiritual turmoil for the ruling class and the collaborating professional managerial class flunkies and sycophants yet again the violence of words such as productivity efficiency free markets national sovereignty etc all contribute to the intolerable living conditions for large portions of the world s population this is the metaphysics of capital where abstract business concepts have very real and deadly consequences jason read writes in crisis and critique labor power must be made virtual and then productive the foundation of the capitalist relationship is the separation of workers form the means of production and thus the potential of labor power as a potential once this potential is sold enters into the workplace it must be actualized transformed into actual productive acts he goes on to cite pierre macherey student of althusser from this point of view we could say that when the capitalist occupies himself with his workers labor power which he has acquired the right to employ in exchange for a wage treating it as a productive power whose productivity he intends to increase in order to produce relative surplus value he practices metaphysics not in a theoretical but in a practical way he practices this peculiar sort of metaphysics not during his leisure time as a distraction or mental exercise as he would a crossword puzzle but throughout the entire working day dedicated to production by opening up his company to notions such as power capacity and causation he thereby makes them a reality realizing these fictions these products of the mind which he then employs with daunting efficacy in this way with payrolls and charts of organizational tasks at hand he shows better than a philosopher s abstract proofs that the work of metaphysics could not be more material provided that one knows how to put it to good use in introducing it into the factory one could incidentally derive from this a new and caustic definition of metaphysics in this rather specific context it boils down to a mechanism for profit making which is no small matter this means that amongst other inventions that have changed the course of history capitalism has found the means the procedure the trick enabling it to put abstract concepts into practice the hallmark of its genius more bluntly the contributors at the website endnotes put it like this the abstract universal value whose existence is posited by the exchange abstraction acquires a real existence vis à vis particular concrete labours which are subsumed under it the real existence of abstractions which acquire the ability to subsume the concrete world of production under them and posit themselves as the truth of this world is for marx nothing other than a perverted enchanted ontologically inverted reality the absurdity and violence which hegel perceives in a relation of subsumption applies not only to hegel s system itself but also to the actual social relations of capitalist society as one can see it takes a very specific sort of discipline to deploy this type of thought as well as to mouth the pr double plus good newspeak that philip hammond and the gm executive spoke of above as we have seen through history the consequences are not pretty this shackling of the human spirit molds workers in a totalitarian way and becomes the baseline ideology for accessing elite institutions of knowledge and power hence this is why some today speak of total subsumption in this sense production via exploitation of labor power only speaks of half of the problem the flip side is that humans are produced as cogs or put another way the social reproduction of the masses is instilled by the constant reminder under capitalism to be productive market yourself speak appropriately in every varied situation etc thus humans are molded to believe in the need for police tax collection agencies borders and industrial civilization as usual the unwaged labor of care work in the home continues to oppress women around the globe as feminists such as martha gimenez kathi weeks nancy fraser silvia federici and many others have shown words cannot express how far capitalism extends into daily life or the amount of harmful and hateful behavior it has led to humans are valued only insofar as they are productive productive in a myopic framework designed to narrow consciousness reduce potentialities blight the human condition and destroy and degrade wildlife and ecosystems people all over the world are simply being farmed for their labor power their creativity their social media posts to pay taxes the various licenses fees and insurances needed to secure a bare means of existence not only are the elite thriving economically the 1 are estimated to live 10 years longer than the average of the 99 as danny dorling explains in inequality and the 1 the modern calendar and clock also regiment divides and orients our perception around the holy grail of productivity turning human potentialities for creativity for organic agriculture for art for useful crafts for efficient renewable energy systems for basic joy and destroy those possibilities instead we find abstract notions of labor and value which are then actualized and concretized into power paving the way for progress our time system essentially from the very beginning of western civilization in mesopotamia started with set dates for repaying debts which eventually morphed into regularly scheduled time frames for starting wars shackling us all to a five day work week etc our time system is the operating system for empire its software hence the parisians desire to end it solutions lie in listening to indigenous peoples worldwide who have been living sustainably for millennia via processes of trust building of starting truth and reconciliation for past atrocities and modern day dispossession of growing communities based on non profit cooperatives etc tight knit indigenous livelihoods counter the growth of destructive forms of modern discipline an unnatural system of time instrumental reason capitalism racism and patriarchy through power structures distributed horizontally with deliberative bodies and direct democratic practices authentic resistance against our system should therefore question and dispel the lies embedded in what the rulers and functionaries of capital call discipline our interior lives have been colonized our jobs are alienating and exploitative and our social media and data are now harvested for wealth the abstractions of capital must be abandoned perhaps only by returning to the integral the holistic something closer to the earth by finding something elemental by reigniting desire can the vast utopian dreams and potentialities which for many lie dormant lead us to find some sort of joy and sustainable methods of living to transform this mad society william hawes is a writer specializing in politics and environmental issues he is author of the ebook planetary vision

by tetsushi kajimoto and daniel leussink tokyo reuters the bank of japan cut its inflation forecasts on wednesday but maintained its massive stimulus program with governor haruhiko kuroda warning of growing risks to the economy from trade protectionism and faltering global demand rising pressure from the trade war between china and the united states japan s biggest trading partners is adding to strains on the world s third largest economy and undermining years of efforts by policymakers to foster durable growth data earlier in the day showed japan s exports in december fell the most in two years to be honest if u s china trade tensions are drawn out there will be a serious risk to the global economy first to the two countries own economies kuroda told a news conference after the end of the two day policy review for now that possibility is slim and i hope they will resolve this soon advertisement advertisement as expected the boj trimmed its inflation forecasts reinforcing views that it will have to stick with its unprecedented economic support for some time to come but despite rising risks such as trade disputes and brexit the central bank also maintained its view that japan s economy will continue to expand at a modest pace kuroda struck an optimistic tone saying the economy would likely continue expanding through fiscal 2020 however a recent reuters poll of economists showed external factors have increased the chances of japan sliding into a recession in the fiscal year starting in april making it even harder for the boj to reach its elusive 2 percent inflation target advertisement advertisement china on monday reported its slowest growth in nearly three decades and it is expected to lose more steam in coming months the international monetary fund imf trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs amid the trade tensions such downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be heightening recently and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms and households sentiment in japan the boj said in a quarterly outlook report released along with the policy decision the boj reiterated a pledge to continue buying japanese government bonds and left its short term interest rate target unchanged at minus 0 1 percent it also said it would keep guiding 10 year government bond yields around zero percent it will be difficult for the boj to discuss policy normalization or an exit strategy for the moment as risks from global economies are rising said hiroaki mutou chief economist at tokai tokyo research institute advertisement advertisement the central bank will likely save easing measures for later and it will examine how the fed policy movement will be and how it will likely impact the yen he said concerns about a global slowdown and volatile financial markets have prompted the u s federal reserve to take a more cautious stance on future interest rate increases after four hikes last year weighing on the dollar lower inflation forecast in its outlook report the boj s nine member board cut its economic growth projections for the current fiscal year to march but raised its growth forecasts slightly for the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 with government spending expected to offset the pain of a planned sales tax hike this october advertisement advertisement the boj cut its forecast for core consumer inflation to 0 9 percent in the coming fiscal year from 1 4 percent reflecting slumping oil prices it was the fourth downward revision by the central bank to its inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 since it was first issued in april 2017 that was still above a 0 7 percent forecast by analysts polled by reuters the central bank also trimmed core consumer inflation view for fiscal 2020 to 1 4 percent from 1 5 percent forecast in october many economists believe the boj s next move will be to start normalizing policy with steps likely to include expanding its 10 year bond yield fluctuation from 0 2 percent and raising the 10 year yield target from around zero percent advertisement advertisement a majority expect that would happen in 2020 or later as part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on a huge pile of cash the central bank decided to extend the deadline by one year for lending schemes aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost loans and support growth foundations the boj s radical stimulus program has had some unintended consequences as years of low rates hurt financial institutions profits the central bank has also amassed a mountain of japanese government bonds and exchange traded funds etfs in its marathon asset buying spree risking distortions in financial

contain forward looking statements which represent the company s belief regarding future events which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company s control our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward looking statements we ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release you should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the fcc more from the motley fool i d not like to turn the call over to thomas peterffy thomas thomas peterffy chief executive officer good afternoon i would like to briefly touch on two items related to our recent announcements first as we signified in our press release in early january as of the end of september i will be passing the ceo title to milan galik our current president i m not doing this because i want to retire and travel around the world and hang out in lovely hotels and beaches i would find that boring i absolutely love to work at interactive brokers and i will continue to do that by recognizing that due to my mature age i can best contribute by focusing on strategic and structural issues going forward milan is an engineer he joined us fresh out of university and has worked with me at interactive brokers for 28 years he has been on our board since we went public in 2007 with milan as ceo the strength and quality of our platform will continue to grow and he shares my goal of making interactive brokers the largest broker in the world those of you who have not met milan at our last annual meeting will have a second chance to do so at this year s annual meeting on the 18th of april in new york city i will remain involved supporting milan and the company as his chairman second there is altogether too much focus on the part of our current and would be future shareholders about the question of what is going to happen to my shares my answer was always that i m a firm believer in the long term success of this company and i m not interested in selling in the near future while that is true people did not want to believe it and there are doubts who are further aggravated by stock tax considerations upon death for that reason i came up with the idea that these concerns would be resolved by me starting a selling program that would dispose of the shares gradually over the next 60 years this program demonstrates my long term commitment to the company it would also generate sufficient cash to deal with the tax issues and will also gradually increase the public float which will be good for the liquidity of the issue accordingly i will implement a trading program starting after the july 2019 earnings announcement and sell 20 000 shares on each business day as our average daily volume is nearly 400 000 shares these sales will have little if any impact nancy please take it from here nancy stuebe director of investor relations thank you interactive brokers once again ended the year with record numbers accounts were 598 000 up 24 and client assets and quarterly darts were at year end record of 128 billion and 951 000 respectively broker fee tax margin was 63 and our total equity is now over 7 billion we achieved this in the face of weaker global securities markets and political and economic uncertainty we are also very pleased that third party information ihs market recently analyzed us stock executions and determined interactive brokers executed orders at 0 50 per round lot better meaning cheaper than the industry average that translates to huge savings for our customers who experience better performance by lowering the trading cost we achieved this improvement through our superior technology and our founding practice of never selling our customers orders instead we search through many venues for the best available price which is often hidden as traders do not want to reveal their buying or selling intentions during our search we constantly refresh accumulated statistical information about the likelihood of finding a better price for any specific stock at any specific venue this software has been expensive to develop and maintain but it pays for itself in generating loyal customers who tend to trade more often and accordingly benefit the most from superior execution fourth quarter net revenues were up 17 to 496 million in 2018 versus 425 million in 2017 adjusted for our usual non core items of currency translation and treasury portfolio marks and especially for last year s 93 million in one time income from the us tax act commissions were 205 million up 21 while our net interest revenue was 243 million up 19 for the full year excluding non core items net revenues were 1 9 billion up 28 and pre tax profit was 1 2 billion up 38 for a pre tax margin of 63 our business is now virtually all electronic brokerage in 2018 the brokerage segment surpassed 1 billion in pre tax profits for the first time reaching nearly 1 2 billion up 37 and achieving 64 pre tax margin there is no other broker who comes close to our levels of profitability as a matter of fact potential new institutional customers often ask the question how can you make a profit with such low prices when we say automation they often do not believe it they think we are doing something funny this is very frustrating but as we have more and more satisfied customers we much rely on them to bring us credibility we continue to offer more benefits to our customers as of january 1st our new interest rate policy will offer accounts with less than 100 000 00 in net asset value interest on their qualifying cash accounts with less than 100 000 00 in nav will receive interest on their cash at a rate proportional to their account size an account with a full 100 000 00 nav will continue to earn the entire 1 9 we currently pay in the us while an account with a 75 000 00 nav will receive 75 of that 1 9 rate or 1 425 and so on we did this to encourage both new customers to open accounts with us and existing customers to consolidate any outside accounts at interactive brokers together with a growing suite of payment services such as direct deposit bill pay and the ib debit mastercard our goal was to make it more convenient and profitable for customers to leave their idle cash at interactive brokers most competitors we know of continue to pay very little cash on cash deposits in their brokerage accounts they pocket your interest we do not we want to give customers benefits that increase their returns and profits and therefore a positive word of mouth now i will go over our five client segments introducing brokers once again posted the strongest account growth up 45 over last year and now make up 31 of our overall accounts client equity grew 10 for introducing brokers and commissions rose 36 we see strong growth in this area because smaller and midsize brokers as well as international ones find it difficult to justify building and maintaining their own technology so they come to us to white brand our state of the art technology and to capitalize on our low costs as various countries and agencies increase their oversight of the financial services industry the regulatory and compliance burden only grows over time starting early in the fourth quarter we noticed that some of our accounts in asia particularly mainland china have taken longer to fund if they can fund at all due to constraints on their local banks regarding capital outflows our account growth for mainland china which was our strongest region dropped by about 70 in the fourth quarter we hope to see this improve after international trade issues are resolved over the next couple of quarters individual customers make up 49 of our accounts 35 of our client equity and half of our commissions they re a very lucrative and well diversified customer segment which saw account growth of 19 for the year commission growth of 22 and client equity growth of 1 the worldwide decline in securities markets in the fourth quarter impacted our customers account performance as existing positions in many of our accounts declined in value even as new funds flows into interactive brokers remained quite healthy our strong commission growth showed we were able to capture the benefits of increased market volatility it is interesting to note that the average age of our nearly 300 000 individual customers is 46 years ranging from eastern europe at 39 years to the us at 49 years this demographic bodes well for our future account growth and customer deposit growth hedge funds constitute 1 of our accounts 9 of our client equity and 10 of our commissions as of december 31 for the year we saw 10 hedge fund account growth and 35 commission growth while client equity declined 6 as most major markets weakened hedge funds are a large multitrillion dollar global market and we continue to have tremendous room to grow in this area proprietary trading firms are 2 of our accounts 10 of client equity and 15 of commissions for the year this group grew 7 in account 4 in commission and 1 in customer equity as we have said in previous calls we are well penetrated in this segment so while we expected to grow it will not represent our largest customer development opportunity finally we have financial advisors they are 16 of our accounts 24 of our customer equity and 16 of our commission accounts in this group grew by 11 commissions by 16 and customer equity by 5 our greenwich compliance group which provides registration and compliance assistance for new and existing rias continues to excel at signing up rias who want to open their own businesses going independent means rias can keep all the fees they earn in an environment where more advisors are looking to become independent our low commission and financing rates high rates of interest paid on cash and the availability of greenwich compliance s services have all contributed to driving growth in this segment globally investment advisors have about 35 trillion in aun the largest market segment we are in so we have plenty of opportunity in this area throughout 2018 we continued to improve existing products and to add new ones like direct deposit and bill pay when an interactive brokers customer comes onto our automated platform they can manage their financial lives with very little interference from us in order to be very low cost as interactive brokers is you must automate and so we have and will continue to automate everything we can this in large part explains how we have the highest profit margins despite charging the lowest cost and paying the highest interest rates on cash our automation because the core of our executive team including milan is almost all software developers everything that moves we try to automate the majority of our new customers come to us by recommendation of existing customers so the more we do in order for our customers to have a successful experience the more likely they will enthusiastically recommend our platform to other the more customers we onboard now the more customers they will bring to us in the following weeks and months with that i will turn the call over to our cfo paul brody who will go through the numbers for the quarter paul brody chief financial officer thanks nancy welcome everyone to the call as usual i ll review in this case fourth quarter and the full year results so we have much ground to cover main factors driving those numbers and then we ll open it up to questions let me begin by highlighting that our headline numbers for net revenues and pre tax income comply year over year decreases at 4 and 15 respectively but when we remove the effects on non core operating items primarily from the 2017 us tax act and our currency diversification strategy these measures increased 17 and 14 respectively i ll give more detail on this in my review of the financials starting with operating data in the fourth quarter higher market volatility and interest rates led to higher revenues on a firm foundation of growth in customer accounts total accounts grew to 598 000 up 24 year over year contributing to client equity growth of 3 despite declines in many global securities markets we saw growth in nearly all customer segments particularly individuals financial advisors and introducing brokers although regionally as nancy mentioned the tightening of capital controls in some parts of asia has slowed the flow of new funds increased market volatility and higher interest rates gave rise to higher commissions and then interest income respectively volatility as measured by the average vix grew significantly to 21 the highest level since 2011 and up from the level of 10 in the fourth quarter of last year increased volatility led to 21 and 34 increases in options and futures volumes respectively while stock shares volume was off 26 stock volumes were once again impacted by lighter trading and low priced stocks as a result of the shift the higher priced stocks the number of shares traded declined but the darts and commissions on those trades both rose finally fx dollar volumes fell year over year but recovered marginally from the third quarter with higher volatility and continuing account growth our total darts for the quarter grew 30 over the prior year quarter our cleared commission per dart fell 3 to 3 79 as higher market volatility led to more caution and smaller average trade sizes results from the full year reflected the momentum and operational leverage of our core brokerage business full year commissions grew 20 on higher volatility and trade volumes and net interest income from brokerage grew 38 as interest rates and average margin loan balances rose higher volumes were seen in futures and options and slightly lower in stocks echoing the trends of the fourth quarter for the full year total darts grew 25 while cleared commission per dart fell 3 to 3 87 as higher volatility in the first and fourth quarters led to more caution and smaller average trade sizes turning to net interest margins in our net interest margin table you will see that our nim widened for the fourth quarter to 1 65 up from 1 43 in the year ago quarter for the year nim grew to 1 62 up from 1 27 last year the main drivers were benchmark interest rates customer cash balances margin lending and securities lending the federal reserve raised interest rates again this quarter in late december making a total of four increases over the course of 2018 during the year we kept a relatively short duration on the us treasury portfolio and we recorded mark to market gains of 8 million for the quarter and 9 million for the year as market expectations of further rate hikes diminished we plan to hold these securities through maturity so these gains and losses are temporary but as brokers unlike banks gaap rules require us to mark these securities to market in our financial reporting outside the us interest rates are relatively unchanged with a few modest exceptions like the canadian dollar this moderates our expectations on rising net interest income as about 27 of customer credit balances are not in us dollars increased customer cash balances and us rate increases generated more net interest income segregated cash interest income rose 79 primarily due to fed interest rate hikes our fdic insured bank deposit suite program introduced just over a year ago has reached 1 7 billion and continues to grow and contribute to higher net interest income this program offers high interest rates in fdic insurance on up to 2 5 million of cash in our customers accounts in addition to the 250 000 of sipc coverage note that this revenue is reported in other income on the income statement but it is reported with interest income in the nim table margin loan interest grew 58 over last year from a combination of factors including higher average margin loan balances however as most major global securities markets fell in the fourth quarter our customers pulled back somewhat on leverage with average margin loan balances down 2 from the third quarter securities lending interest income was 51 lower this quarter due to several factors there were fewer hard to borrow high rate lending opportunities than there were last year especially in the kind of risk cost environment that we saw in the fourth quarter customer short stock value was down 9 from the prior year end reflecting the 6 drop in the s p 500 and also customers cutting back their market exposure on a sequential basis nim narrowed by three basis points primarily on declines in margins loans and securities lending income our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in us rates is as follows as we continue to experience growth in customer cash balances we aim to maximize our net interest income within the constraints of investment instruments permitted by regulations and per the liquidity and credit risk management expectations of further rate increases are typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest therefore in our calculation we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise in rates separate from the impact of rate hikes that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments with that assumption we expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional 15 5 million in net interest income on customer balances over the next four quarters and 15 2 million as the full yearly run rate the run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new higher rate turning to the segment results electronic brokerage produced gains in both commissions and net interest income for both the fourth quarter and the full year periods for the fourth quarter brokerage net revenues are 490 million up 26 pretax income was 311 million up 23 for a 63 pre tax margin treasury marks flung to an 8 million gain from the 9 million loss in the year ago quarter in the expense categories execution and clearing grow 33 to 69 million in line with trade volumes fixed expenses were 108 million up 26 primarily due to increases in employee compensation to expand the growing brokerage business the previously disclosed migration of expenses related to the winding down of market making increased legal and compliance expenses and contributions to reserves customer bad debt expense was 2 million this quarter demonstrating again the continued effectiveness of our risk management systems in limiting customer defaults even in the face of high volatility periods for the full year brokerage net revenues rose to a record 1 84 billion up 31 with pre tax income reaching 1 18 billion up 37 for a 64 pre tax margin fixed expenses rose 22 to 40million and adjusted for treasury marks pre tax margin was also 64 market making continues to consist of customer facilitation activities that will be retained going forward and options market making in several remaining profitable markets outside the us for which we continue to operate and evaluate for the time being for the quarter net revenue were 17 million of which 7 million were trading gains and the bulk of the remainder was net interest income market making pre tax income was 9 million for the year net revenues were 76 million and pre tax income was 34 million as of the end of 2018 we have nearly fully absorbed the 40 million of expenses that were projected to migrate to brokerage expenses from the customer facilitation activities are largely offset by related revenues and such activities should have minimal impact on margins if they are later absorbed into brokerage the corporate segment reflects the effects of our currency diversification strategy we carry our equity in proportion to a basket of 14 currencies we call it the global to best reflect the international scope of our business as the us dollar strengthened against most major currencies this quarter we incurred an overall loss from our strategy of 18 million of this 6 million is reported as other comprehensive income and 12 million in included in earnings we estimate the total decrease in comprehensive earnings per share from currency effects to be 0 03 with 0 02 reported in other income and 0 01 as oci for the year the overall loss from our strategy was 99 million of which 80 million was reported as oci and 19 million included in earnings the total decrease in comprehensive earnings per share from currency effects for the year was 0 20 with 0 02 reported as other income and 0 18 as oci turning to the income statement for the fourth quarter net revenues are 492 million down 4 over the year ago quarter that included positive impacts from us tax act and the global adjusted for non operating items net revenues were 496 million for the quarter up 17 over last year s 425 million non operating items include the 12 million loss on our currency strategy and the 8 million gain from treasury marks from the current quarter and most significantly a 93 million gain related to the us tax act recorded in other income for the fourth quarter of 2017 commission revenue rose 21 on higher volume in options and futures and as i mentioned earlier higher darts and stocks partially offset by lower average trade sizes in most product categories the modest decline of our overall average cleared commission per dart to 3 79 reflected this mix of our 243 million of net interest income brokerage produced 234 million market making 8 million and corporate the remainder other income which includes our global currency strategy treasury marks and other fees and income we receive was 37 million the non recurrence of last year s 93 million us tax act benefit and the modest decline in the global offset increases in treasury marks and in most other line items for the full year net revenues were 1 90 billion of 12 over the prior year full year adjusted net revenues are 1 91 billion of 28 over last year s 1 50 billion non core items for 2018 include the 19 million loss on our currency strategy and the 9 million gain from treasury marks in 2017 the primary non core items were a 110 million gain on the global and 93 million gain related to the us tax act and 11 million gain on the transfer of our market making business and a 12 million loss from treasury marks non interest expenses were 183 million for the quarter up 21 from last year the primary drivers were 17 million higher execution and clearing fees in line with increased trading activity as well as higher general administrative expenses largely stemming from legal and compliance costs and reserves for the full year non interest expenses were 707 million of 8 driven primarily by the same factors plus higher employee compensation and benefits at year end our total heads count stood at 1 413 up 15 from last year we have been hiring most aggressively in the area of the clients services legal and compliance and software development and to this end we continue to build up our operations in india for the fourth quarter pre tax income was 309 million down 15 versus last year which contained the non core items i noted on an adjusted basis pre tax income was 313 million up 14 over last year s pre tax income of 274 million representing an adjusted pre tax margin of 63 and for the full year pre tax income was 1 20 billion up 14 and adjusted for non core items was 1 21 billion up 38 versus last year s 872 million diluted earnings per share were 0 57 for the quarter versus the loss of 0 02 for the same period in 2017 without the impact from non core items diluted earnings per share would have been 0 58 for the quarter versus 0 43 in the year ago period for the year diluted earnings per share were 2 28 versus 1 07 last year and adjusted for the non core items including the us tax act in 2017 diluted earnings per share were 2 28 for 2018 and a 1 39 for 2017 comprehensive diluted earnings per share which includes all currency effects for 0 56 for the quarter versus a loss of 0 02 last year and for the year they were 2 09 versus 1 22 last year ex the non core items full year comprehensive diluted earnings per share would have been 2 28 versus 1 39 last year to help investors better understand our earnings the split between the public shareholders and the non controlling interest for the fourth quarter is as follows starting with income before income taxes of 309 million we first add 1 million of other income actually net expense in this case related only to the public company resulting in 310 million of operating companies income we then deduct 9 million for mostly foreign income taxes paid by our operating companies that leaves 301 million of which 82 or that 247 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non controlling interests the remaining 18 our 54 million is available for the public company shareholders but as this is a non gaap measure it is not reported on our income statement after we deduct that 1 million of net expense reported in other income from the 54 million and then deduct remaining taxes of 10 million the public company s net income available for common stock holders is the 43 million you see reported on our income statement our income tax expense of 19 million consists of this 10 million plus the 9 million of taxes paid by the operating companies our balance sheet remains highly liquid with low leverage with a record 7 2 billion in consolidated equity we are extremely well capitalized from regulatory standpoint and are deploying our equity capital in the brokerage business as it continues to grow we hold excess capital in order to take advantage of opportunities as well as to demonstrate the strengths and depth of our balance sheet we continue to carry no long term debt at december 31st margin debits were 27 billion a decrease of 13 from last year multi year highs in volatility combined with a down graphed in global securities markets especially in the fourth quarter led to our clients curtailing leverage as we noted in previous calls we also expect swings in marginal lending due to our success in attracting institutional hedge fund customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage we remain able to satisfy customer s willingness to take on leverage when market yields present these opportunities out of our consolidated equity capital at december 31st 2018 of 7 2 billion 5 8 billion was held in brokerage 1 0 billion in market making and customer facilitation activities and the remainders in corporate now i ll turn the call back over to the moderator and we can take some questions questions and answers operator thank you sir ladies and gentlemen at this time if you would like to ask a question over the phone please press then 1 on your telephone key pad if your questions have been answered you wish to remove yourself from the queue simply press the key once again ladies and gentlemen that is and then 1 ask the question our first question will come from rich repetto with sandler o neill your line is now open rich repetto sandler o neill analyst yeah good evening first i want to congratulate thomas for building an outstanding company and really setting the standard for the active trading platform that you ve built congratulations thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich repetto sandler o neill analyst yes the first question is just trying to get into more the details on the incremental interest expense when you re paying below 100 000 the accounts with 100 000 so we ve ball parked it somewhere between 20 to 30 million per year with the different moving part i guess could you help us since this is a public format is that reasonable and i don t know whether you could narrow it down any more than that paul j brody chief financial officer we did some yeah we did some modeling on that rich of course our estimate is with current balances and no changes at all it s a little bit under 20 million annual additional interest expense however that translates into only about 2 5 of balances that is to say if the policy attracts only about 2 5 of our credit balances as an increase then we break even and if we attract more than that then it s a successful policy rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it so 19 million on current balances then paul j brody chief financial officer 19 5 was modeling but it s only it had certain assumption that therefore take it as an estimate rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it and then i guess the next question would be on expenses over all is it still i guess the guidance has been expenses will grow somewhat at the pace of revenue or could you give us thomas i guess the overall guidance for expenses as you continue to try to scale up and build the broker thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i would expect expenses to grow 10 to 15 rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it ok that s very helpful and then my last question thomas is i guess we can see the head winds that are out there or some of the headwinds that you ve mentioned about the asia problem with money coming out of asia as well as the smaller trade size issue and you ve brought that up on the past several calls with regulators sort of giving that more scrutiny to the lower the stocks that the low price stocks and just to look at it from the tail wind side what other things besides volatility we know that helped but what are the things that you think can help overcome some of these the headwinds may be temporary hopefully but what you re seeing it keeps you real optimistic i guess just to review some of those thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i think clearly stated its growth it s growth of accounts that s what this business is all about accounts will keep on growing and were getting new accounts in all of our segments and it looks really good but of course at the beginning of the year everything looks good but this year is really looking good rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it congrats again thomas and thank you thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of chris allen with compass point your line is now open chris allen compass point analyst evening guys offer my congratulations as well thomas it s been a pleasure to watch the growth over the years if i could just actually dive a little bit deeper into some of rich s questions one just in the asia pac region is it just china that you re seeing the impact or is it a little bit more broad than that and also is it i mean from your comment right now just before it sounds like 2019 off to a good start have you seen consistency in north american and europe and the other regions i e this is just a little bit of just a china us issue or are we also seeing an impact from the market pull packs that we saw over the course of the fourth quarter i mean both of which if we think of it longer term will fade but i just want to hopefully try to delineate between the two thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer it s mainly a china us issue and it s not only the difficulty of mainland china it s customers trying to take money outside of the country but it s also the chinese stock market as you know the chinese stock market has not done well in this past year and many of our chinese customers in fact carry chinese stocks with us so their account size or the volume of the accounts has diminished drastically because of their long position in chinese stocks otherwise as far as asia is concerned our econ growth has picked up in the countries outside and around china countries like singapore and hong king and other countries in the area similarly our econ growth is picking up in eastern europe and even in latin america so our while in the united states our econ growth is fairly stable at relatively lower rate of around even in the low teens in other places we go up in the 20 s and 30 s that s what we see chris allen compass point analyst got it that s very helpful and i think the other brokers would take mid teens in the us from an account growth perspective just wanted to ask also on the expense outlook the 10 to 15 one is that the outlook for the fixed expense base or does that include execution in clearing and two does that encompass new project that you guys are working on you guys are always working on something whether i mean i think you mentioned the goldman conference looking at potential for a bank in the us or outside just an example of things you think about but any color there would be helpful thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i was talking about fixed expenses execution is clearing and it is not under our control i hope it will grow by a huge percentage because it goes hand in hand with our commission income the greater the commission income the greater the execution expense we are basically focusing on keep hiring more and more people with expertise in software development especially and in compliance we hope to grow expenses this is not this is a pleasure for us to grow the expenses because that means that we are able to recruit the talent because we really need people to in order to make this business grow as fast as we can chris allen compass point analyst got it thanks a lot guys i ll get back in the queue congrats again thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of mac sykes with g research your line is now open mac sykes g research analyst i would echo the comment to thomas and congratulations milan looking forward to the next 28 years as well thomas we always look forward to your color in the markets and i just wanted to throw out a couple questions on that framework first we ve got an announcement recently about a new exchange the memx i know it s still early days i just wanted to get your feedback on the need for new exchange and what some of the dynamics that might bring also maybe an update on how you thought markets function in december in terms of passive in your systems and then perhaps an update on payment for order flow going forward in terms of market structure thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer this is a three part question that has only one answer basically as far as this new exchange is concerned i can only guess as to the motives and i think that maybe some brokers were given some heat about payment for order flow and so they are trying to transfer the business in which they give the hand over the orders to the internalizers over the counter they are trying to do the same thing now in officially registered exchange it s sort of looks better i think the business is going to be probably the same payment for order flow we do not see or expect any change as far as liquidity is concerned i think we are the more orders get purchased by internalizers whether it s on this new exchange or otherwise i think the liquidity lessens further because these orders never see daylight and obviously people who would who can limit orders of the exchanges are doing that in the hopes of getting to trade with some customer orders and that is not happening i think that liquidity is going to continue to degrade as payment for order flow takes a greater and greater percentage of the overall volume mac sykes g research analyst okay and then just one follow up on the china asia aspects assuming we do get a trade deal done in markets in china and that area kind of stabilize would you think that there s some compressed demand at this point that could so we could see kind of a knee jerk reaction in terms of engagement following a broader headline of satisfying thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i do not know how the capital controls are actually connected with the trade fight we sense that there is some connection we sense that the capital controls get harder as the trade fight gets harder but we cannot promise you that if the trade fight resolves itself the capital controls will be lifted we hope but there are certainly no assurances that we can give you on that mac sykes g research analyst great thank you so much operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of kyle voigt with kbw your line is now open kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good afternoon just another question on china if i could i think you previously disclosed around 16 of your accounts were from china just to clarify is that 16 a year mainland china only or is that a different account thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer that was mainland china kyle voigt kbw analyst okay and then i have one more on china and then i ll move to something else in october bloomberg reported that tiger brokers was considering a us ipo alongside another china based broker i know ib made an investment in tiger in 2017 just wondering if the potential broker ipos change anything for ib from a business perspective and then more broadly if you could address the competitive environment in serving mainland china outside of this trade dispute i think you made some comments earlier in the year about maybe new or different competitors likely to emerge over the coming years thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer we do not expect any changes as far as our business is concerned from tiger brokers going public maybe it will to some extent increase their business and since we do their business it would increase ours but i do not expect a major impact now as far as the competitive landscape there is we haven t seen any major changes there are these online brokers like tiger and futu and i assume that there are others that are forming in the background i expect that on the long run we will have more and more competitors or customers it s hard to tell which one if we succeed in getting them become customers of ours then it s good for us if we do not it s not so good for us but china is even though it s 16 of our accounts now i expect that as the rest of the world becomes more capital and investment conscious that percentage will either probably diminish somewhat kyle voigt kbw analyst okay understood another question for you thomas regarding the trading plan that will become effective in july just to confirm do anticipate potentially increasing the pace of the share sales and future trading plans or is that just thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer no i do not no kyle voigt kbw analyst okay and then lastly for me and then i ll hop back in the queue is just a question regarding the securities portfolio i think from the beginning of 2016 through the middle of 2017 you significantly shorten the duration of that securities portfolio just given that the market is pricing in a relatively low probability of the fed hiking again how are you thinking about the duration of that securities portfolio as for you were adding through 2019 thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i think that well it s just my thinking that we may have a pleasant surprise and the economy could perk up and we could get one or two rate hikes in 2019 but don t hold me to that kyle voigt kbw analyst okay thanks a lot thomas operator thank you and just as a reminder ladies and gentlemen to ask a question the then 1 and our next question will come from chris harris at wells fargo your line is now open chris harris wells fargo analyst thanks guys the change in your interest policy how is it only affecting 2 5 of the balances i was under the impression that balance is under 100 000 where a much larger percent of the total paul j brody chief financial officer yeah maybe i wasn t clear when i said the 2 5 we re talking about is that based on that incremental expense under the new policy on the current balances if we were able to attract as little as 2 5 additional balances because we re paying more interest and we can get customers to consolidate more balances with ib if we were able to attract as little as 2 5 more that would cover the additional cost chris harris wells fargo analyst i got it paul j brody chief financial officer then any amount over 2 5 means it s a successful policy for us it s chris harris wells fargo analyst okay that s paul j brody chief financial officer a fairly low bar yeah chris harris wells fargo analyst okay clear with respect to the slowdown in the counts are you guys seeing any slowdown from your hedge fund customer group and i ask that question because there have been some hedge fund closures the fourth quarter was difficult from a performance standpoint for a lot of funds is that starting to make its way through your business or not thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer we have not seen that yet chris harris wells fargo analyst okay and then one quick last numbers question can you walk us through the difference between the net interest incomes you guys report on a consolidated basis versus the net interest income that s in the table it looks to be like a 9 million variance between those two numbers paul j brody chief financial officer yeah just conceptually there are elements that are reported as either interest income or reported in the other income line item on the income statement as according to what gaap requires and so there are interest like elements that might be related to for example foreign exchange swaps which we do on a very short term basis for treasury management and to improve our overall interest picture that effectively generate interest income but gaap doesn t consider that interest income so it might be reported certain line items as other income but we take all of these items for analysis purposes and bring them into the net interest margin table so that everything that s either clearly net interest or a net interest like line item are all brought together so that we could do the whole picture another good example is the fdic sweep program because technically it generates fees not interest and so on the income statement it s another income and then net interest margin analysis in the table it s in there along with interest income chris harris wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time it is now my pleasure to hand the conference back over to ms nancy stuebe for any closing comments or remarks nancy stuebe director of investor relations thank you

spread the love harare reuters zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on anti government protesters following a hike in the price of fuel lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations zimbabwe s human rights commission zhrc accused security forces of systematic torture critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterised the 37 year regime of former leader robert mugabe who was forced from power after a coup in november 2017 the crisis will not be easy to fix there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit 42 percent in december the highest in a decade foreign investors are by and large staying away what sparked the latest clashes everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line on jan 12 mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to 3 31 per litre from 1 32 from midnight but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash u s dollars it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement some residents say that while calm has returned soldiers have continued to beat up civilians many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre election promises to kick start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong arm rule of his predecessor genesis of cash shortages the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before in its place the government adopted the u s dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless but over time supply of the u s and south african currencies dried up so in november 2016 authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages the notes which now have a total face value of 400 million are backed by a 500 million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said they are used like cash officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1 1 on the street 1 fetches up to 3 bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of u s dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as 30 in bond notes companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits zollars when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth 10 billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars remain officially pegged at 1 1 to the u s dollar but on the black market 1 is now worth 4 zollars that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves but finance minister mthuli ncube said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months how are businesses affected companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in u s dollars last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate u s dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch the group said its members had a backlog of 480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers 11 million zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages part owned by anheuser busch inbev said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened what s next mnangagwa a former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november 2017 was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing mugabe era laws that restrict the media mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of u s sanctions against officials from the zanu pf ruling party top military figures and some government owned firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its 2 billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash shortages share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like

the governor of the central bank of nigeria cbn mr godwin emefiele on tuesday disclosed that the bank would increase the number of items placed on import restrictions from 42 to 50 the governor who disclosed this at the end of the meeting of cbn s monetary policy committee mpc in abuja warned that the economic intelligence department of the bank in collaboration with the economic and financial crimes commission efcc would henceforth investigate any company or individuals suspected of bringing these items through smuggling or any means for money laundering and economic sabotage addressing journalists at cbn headquarters emefiele said if we discover and conclusively that these companies or individuals that are involved in bringing these goods we would write to all the banks that they should blacklist all those companies and individuals running those companies that they can no longer operate any bank accounts in any nigerian bank we don t need to talk about prosecuting them but just to say we will not allow you to do business in nigeria and of course you know the implications of that what i said is that cbn will get even more aggressive to see to it that any or all food items that can be produced in nigeria and consumed in nigeria and are currently being imported into nigeria that we would go through our records and once we convince ourselves that these products can be produced in nigeria we will place them on the fx restriction list it means that you cannot source foreign exchange from nigeria foreign exchange market to import those items into nigeria if you have free dollars you can bring it in but you will not be able to even make payments for those goods with dollars from the nigerian foreign exchange market this is because we think that the initiatives that cbn has put in place in the past to cut imports and diversify the structure of the nigerian economy is yielding results and we will continue to be that aggressive he noted on assessment of the economy the governor said it is important for me to say that if we think about where we are coming from i would say i like to use some numbers for instance in september 2008 nigeria s reserve was about 62 billion gdp was 7 2 percent inflation was 15 percent by january 2014 gdp was 6 2 percent inflation had trended downwards to 8 percent and external reserve was 40 percent let us not forget that we were in a period of prosperity in terms of crude prices between 2009 and 2014 which is five straight years with no shut ins in pipelines with high crude oil price reserve still dropped from the end of 2014 we started another round of global crises the global crises resulted in in nigeria gdp dropped to 2 79 percent in 2015 went further and contracted to negative of 1 58 percent in 2016 improved in 2017 to and then we are hopeful that 2018 would end at about 1 8 percent inflation was 15 percent in 2008 dropped to 8 percent in 2014 and it moved up to about 9 5 percent and by january 2017 it has moved up to 18 7 percent but today through the activities of monetary and fiscal authorities inflation had gone down to 11 4 percent by 2008 with higher reserves with higher productivity reserves dropped to 40 billion in january 2014 anmd ended 2014 at 35 billion went further down in 2015 to 28 billion and indeed by october 2016 as a result of economic crises reserves had plummeted further to 23 billion today as a result of all the actions and activities of both the monetary and fiscal authorities supported by the government reserve is up went to 39 billion in 2017 and 2018 we closed at 42 5 and i said so in my communique that even as at now as a result of the confidence in the management of the nigerian foreign exchange the confidence in the management of the country we ve seen confidence even in foreign investors returning reserves as at yesterday was 43 28 billion we have seen fx stability in the market and as if all of you will recall that sometime in 2016 and up to early 2017 we saw a situation where exchange rate even in the black market had moved up in february to n525 and i was being told that by march it will hit n1000 but as a result of the actions of cbn today the all marketers in fact bdc has come down to about n360 and even slightly lower the i e window which is a market that we set up as a free in free out market today is about n362 so we have seen a substantial convergence in the foreign exchange market in nigeria emefiele pointed out on the 43 281 billion external reserves the governor said forecasts for key macro economic variables in 2019 portend a positive outlook for the domestic economy this is expected to be driven by fiscal stimulus from increase in oil and non oil receipts to support the federal government s erpg plans the economy is projected to grow by two percent by imf and 2 2 percent by the world bank and 2 28 percent by cbn key headwinds to these forecasts however are softening of oil prices persistent security challenges arising from insurgency in north east and herdsmen attacks in some parts of the country and perceived political risks associated with 2019 general elections he added according to him the mpc was of the view that oil prices may however remain relatively stable within 50 barrel bracket in view of recent opec production cutting actions the committee noted with satisfaction the performance of the economy in 2018 highlighting the achievements in key macroeconomic indicators in the face of global uncertainties and domestic challenges in particular it noted the stability in the exchange rate stable accretion to external reserves moderation in inflation and gradual improvement in output growth the mpc further noted the low but gradual improvement in the last six consecutive quarters commencing from the second quarter of 2017 mpc noted that given global economic conditions the risks confronting emerging markets and developing economies in recent times as well as the productive capacity of the economy managed float regime management of the central bank have delivered the most optimum results when compared to other emerging markets in recent times consequently capital flows into the domestic economy has continued unabated after an initial lull the committee considered the risk to the growth of the economy noting downward revision in the projected global output in 2019 the adverse impact of the trade wars between united states and its major trading partners the likelihood of lower crude oil prices impact on capital flows of continuing monetary policy normalization by major advanced economies distorted signals of brexit negotiations as well as pockets of other socio political tensions and perceived election risks on the domestic front on external borrowing emefiele said the committee noted the increase in debt levels advising for caution as it could fast be approaching the pre 2005 paris club exit levels mpc also noted that although there was an increase in inflation rate for the second consecutive month based on month on month inflation continued to moderate indicating that the year on year measures will also moderate in the near term tighten may force banks to reprice assets thus increasing the cost of credit thus elevating credit risks in the economy it will also worsen the position of non performing loans of the banks again tightening would dampen investments and hamper the improvements in output growth given the current fragile growth performance so far achieved all 11 members therefore voted to keep the policy parameters unchanged from their current levels he added

the bank of japan cut its inflation forecasts on wednesday and warned of rising risks to the economy from faltering global demand further pushing back policymakers years long efforts to foster durable growth as widely expected the boj retained its ultra easy monetary settings at its policy review leaving japan some way off from exiting a sweeping stimulus programme begun in 2013 the central bank also maintained its view that japan s economy the world s third largest will continue to expand at a modest pace yet the rising pressure on global growth from a trade war between the united states and china japan s biggest trading partners has many analysts wary about the outlook japan s economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend through fiscal 2020 the central bank said in its quarterly outlook report overseas economies are expected to continue growing firmly on the whole although various developments of late warrant attention such as the trade friction between the united states and china the boj warned the domestic economy faces risks on several fronts including protectionism brexit and us economic policy such downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be heightening recently and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms and households sentiment in japan it said a reuters poll of economists showed those external factors have increased the chances of japan sliding into a recession this coming fiscal year starting in april making it ever so harder for the boj to reach its 2 per cent inflation target moreover the international monetary fund imf trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs amid the trade tensions at its policy setting meeting the boj kept its short term interest rate target at minus 0 1 per cent and a pledge to guide 10 year government bond yields around zero per cent with stubbornly weak inflation forcing it to retain its massive stimulus longer than expected the boj took steps in july to make some changes to its policy framework such as allowing bond yields to move more flexibly around its target it will be difficult for the boj to discuss policy normalization or an exit strategy for the moment as risks from global economies are rising said hiroaki mutou chief economist at tokai tokyo research institute the central bank will likely save easing measures for later and it will examine how the fed policy movement will be and how it will likely impact the yen he said the global slowdown has prompted the federal reserve to take a more cautious stance on its tightening cycle in recent months with traders speculating it might press the pause button soon having raised rates four times last year lower inflation forecast in its outlook report issued on wednesday the boj s nine member board analysed japan s economy including fresh growth and inflation projections through the fiscal year ending in march 2021 the central bank cut its economic growth projections in the current fiscal year to march but it raised its growth forecasts slightly in the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 with government spending seen to offset the pain of the planned tax hike in october in a further sign of the tough road ahead government data out on wednesday showed japan s exports in december fell the most in two years the boj cut its forecast for core consumer inflation to 0 9 per cent in the fiscal year beginning in april from 1 4 per cent reflecting slumping oil prices and the potential fallout from slowing global growth it was the fourth downward revision by the central bank to its inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 since it was first estimated in april 2017 that was still above a 0 7 per cent forecast by analysts polled by reuters the central bank also trimmed core consumer inflation in fiscal 2020 to 1 4 per cent from 1 5 per cent fore cast in october many economists in the poll say the boj s next move is to start normalizing policy with its steps likely including expanding its 10 year bond yield fluctuation from 0 2 per cent and raising the 10 year yield target from around zero percent a majority expect that would happen in 2020 or later as part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on their huge pile of cash the central bank decided to extend the deadline by one year for lending schemes aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost loans and support growth foundations the boj s radical stimulus programme has had some unintended consequences as years of low rates hurt financial institutions profits many boj policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus though external shocks or a sudden spike in the yen could force the central bank to do just that if the economy is at risk of sliding into recession
file photo a japanese flag flutters atop the bank of japan building under construction in tokyo thomson reuters by tetsushi kajimoto and daniel leussink advertisement tokyo reuters the bank of japan cut its inflation forecasts on wednesday and warned of rising risks to the economy from faltering global demand further pushing back policymakers years long efforts to foster durable growth as widely expected the boj retained its ultra easy monetary settings at its policy review leaving japan some way off from exiting a sweeping stimulus program begun in 2013 the central bank also maintained its view that japan s economy the world s third largest will continue to expand at a modest pace yet the rising pressure on global growth from a trade war between the united states and china japan s biggest trading partners has many analysts wary about the outlook japan s economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend through fiscal 2020 the central bank said in its quarterly outlook report advertisement overseas economies are expected to continue growing firmly on the whole although various developments of late warrant attention such as the trade friction between the united states and china the boj warned the domestic economy faces risks on several fronts including protectionism brexit and u s economic policy such downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be heightening recently and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms and households sentiment in japan it said a reuters poll of economists showed those external factors have increased the chances of japan sliding into a recession this coming fiscal year starting in april making it ever so harder for the boj to reach its 2 percent inflation target advertisement moreover the international monetary fund imf trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs amid the trade tensions at its policy setting meeting the boj kept its short term interest rate target at minus 0 1 percent and a pledge to guide 10 year government bond yields around zero percent with stubbornly weak inflation forcing it to retain its massive stimulus longer than expected the boj took steps in july to make some changes to its policy framework such as allowing bond yields to move more flexibly around its target related stories it will be difficult for the boj to discuss policy normalization or an exit strategy for the moment as risks from global economies are rising said hiroaki mutou chief economist at tokai tokyo research institute advertisement the central bank will likely save easing measures for later and it will examine how the fed policy movement will be and how it will likely impact the yen he said the global slowdown has prompted the federal reserve to take a more cautious stance on its tightening cycle in recent months with traders speculating it might press the pause button soon having raised rates four times last year lower inflation forecast in its outlook report issued on wednesday the boj s nine member board analyzed japan s economy including fresh growth and inflation projections through the fiscal year ending in march 2021 advertisement the central bank cut its economic growth projections in the current fiscal year to march but it raised its growth forecasts slightly in the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 with government spending seen to offset the pain of the planned tax hike in october in a further sign of the tough road ahead government data out on wednesday showed japan s exports in december fell the most in two years the boj cut its forecast for core consumer inflation to 0 9 percent in the fiscal year beginning in april from 1 4 percent reflecting slumping oil prices and the potential fallout from slowing global growth it was the fourth downward revision by the central bank to its inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 since it was first estimated in april 2017 that was still above a 0 7 percent forecast by analysts polled by reuters advertisement the central bank also trimmed core consumer inflation in fiscal 2020 to 1 4 percent from 1 5 percent forecast in october many economists in the poll say the boj s next move is to start normalizing policy with its steps likely including expanding its 10 year bond yield fluctuation from 0 2 percent and raising the 10 year yield target from around zero percent a majority expect that would happen in 2020 or later as part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on their huge pile of cash the central bank decided to extend the deadline by one year for lending schemes aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost loans and support growth foundations advertisement the boj s radical stimulus program has had some unintended consequences as years of low rates hurt financial institutions profits many boj policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus though external shocks or a sudden spike in the yen could

by tetsushi kajimoto and daniel leussink tokyo reuters the bank of japan cut its inflation forecasts and stuck to its ultra loose monetary policy on wednesday as pressure on the economy mounts and slowing global demand threatens its years long efforts to foster durable growth the deteriorating global outlook means the boj is some way off from exiting a sweeping stimulus programme begun in 2013 which policymakers have acknowledged will do more harm than good the longer it is retained the central bank maintained its view that japan s economy the world s third largest will continue to expand at a modest pace yet the rising pressure on global growth from a trade war between the united states and china japan s biggest trading partners has many analysts wary about the outlook japan s economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend through fiscal 2020 the central bank said in its quarterly outlook report overseas economies are expected to continue growing firmly on the whole although various developments of late warrant attention such as the trade friction between the united states and china a reuters poll of economists showed those external factors have increased the chances of japan sliding into a recession this coming fiscal year starting in april making it ever so harder for the boj to reach its 2 percent inflation target moreover the international monetary fund imf trimmed its global growth forecasts and a survey showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs amid the trade tensions at its policy setting meeting ending on wednesday the boj kept its short term interest rate target at minus 0 1 percent and a pledge to guide 10 year government bond yields around zero percent with stubbornly weak inflation forcing it to retain its massive stimulus longer than expected the boj took steps in july to make some changes to its policy framework such as allowing bond yields to move more flexibly around its target on wednesday the boj s nine member board issued a quarterly report analysing japan s economy including fresh growth and inflation projections through the fiscal year ending in march 2021 the central bank cut its economic growth projections in the current fiscal year to march but it raised its growth forecasts slightly in the fiscal years 2019 and 2020 with government spending seen to offset the pain of the planned tax hike in october in a further sign of the tough road ahead government data out on wednesday showed japan s exports in december fell the most in two years lower inflation forecast the boj cut its forecast for core consumer inflation to 0 9 percent in the fiscal year beginning in april from 1 4 percent reflecting slumping oil prices and the potential fallout from slowing global growth it was the fourth downward revision by the central bank to its inflation forecast for fiscal 2019 since it was first estimated in april 2017 that was still above a 0 7 percent forecast by analysts polled by reuters the central bank also trimmed core consumer inflation in fiscal 2020 to 1 4 percent from 1 5 percent forecast in october many economists in the poll say the boj s next move is to start normalizing policy with its steps likely including expanding its 10 year bond yield fluctuation from 0 2 percent and raising the 10 year yield target from around zero percent a majority expect that would happen in 2020 or later as part of efforts to prevent financial institutions from sitting on their huge pile of cash the central bank decided to extend the deadline by one year for lending schemes aimed at encouraging financial institutions to boost loans and support growth foundations the boj s radical stimulus programme has had some unintended consequences as years of low rates hurt financial institutions profits many boj policymakers are wary of ramping up stimulus though external shocks or a sudden spike in the yen could force the central bank to do just that if the economy is at risk of sliding into recession reporting by tetsushi kajimoto and daniel leussink additional reporting by kaori kaneko and kiyoshi takenaka editing by shri navaratnam

the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and interactive brokers wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys click here to learn about these picks stock advisor returns as of november 14 2018 i d not like to turn the call over to thomas peterffy thomas thomas peterffy chief executive officer good afternoon i would like to briefly touch on two items related to our recent announcements first as we signified in our press release in early january as of the end of september i will be passing the ceo title to milan galik our current president i m not doing this because i want to retire and travel around the world and hang out in lovely hotels and beaches i would find that boring i absolutely love to work at interactive brokers and i will continue to do that by recognizing that due to my mature age i can best contribute by focusing on strategic and structural issues going forward milan is an engineer he joined us fresh out of university and has worked with me at interactive brokers for 28 years he has been on our board since we went public in 2007 with milan as ceo the strength and quality of our platform will continue to grow and he shares my goal of making interactive brokers the largest broker in the world those of you who have not met milan at our last annual meeting will have a second chance to do so at this year s annual meeting on the 18th of april in new york city i will remain involved supporting milan and the company as his chairman second there is altogether too much focus on the part of our current and would be future shareholders about the question of what is going to happen to my shares my answer was always that i m a firm believer in the long term success of this company and i m not interested in selling in the near future while that is true people did not want to believe it and there are doubts who are further aggravated by stock tax considerations upon death for that reason i came up with the idea that these concerns would be resolved by me starting a selling program that would dispose of the shares gradually over the next 60 years this program demonstrates my long term commitment to the company it would also generate sufficient cash to deal with the tax issues and will also gradually increase the public float which will be good for the liquidity of the issue accordingly i will implement a trading program starting after the july 2019 earnings announcement and sell 20 000 shares on each business day as our average daily volume is nearly 400 000 shares these sales will have little if any impact nancy please take it from here nancy stuebe director of investor relations thank you interactive brokers once again ended the year with record numbers accounts were 598 000 up 24 and client assets and quarterly darts were at year end record of 128 billion and 951 000 respectively broker fee tax margin was 63 and our total equity is now over 7 billion we achieved this in the face of weaker global securities markets and political and economic uncertainty we are also very pleased that third party information ihs market recently analyzed us stock executions and determined interactive brokers executed orders at 0 50 per round lot better meaning cheaper than the industry average that translates to huge savings for our customers who experience better performance by lowering the trading cost we achieved this improvement through our superior technology and our founding practice of never selling our customers orders instead we search through many venues for the best available price which is often hidden as traders do not want to reveal their buying or selling intentions during our search we constantly refresh accumulated statistical information about the likelihood of finding a better price for any specific stock at any specific venue this software has been expensive to develop and maintain but it pays for itself in generating loyal customers who tend to trade more often and accordingly benefit the most from superior execution fourth quarter net revenues were up 17 to 496 million in 2018 versus 425 million in 2017 adjusted for our usual non core items of currency translation and treasury portfolio marks and especially for last year s 93 million in one time income from the us tax act commissions were 205 million up 21 while our net interest revenue was 243 million up 19 for the full year excluding non core items net revenues were 1 9 billion up 28 and pre tax profit was 1 2 billion up 38 for a pre tax margin of 63 our business is now virtually all electronic brokerage in 2018 the brokerage segment surpassed 1 billion in pre tax profits for the first time reaching nearly 1 2 billion up 37 and achieving 64 pre tax margin there is no other broker who comes close to our levels of profitability as a matter of fact potential new institutional customers often ask the question how can you make a profit with such low prices when we say automation they often do not believe it they think we are doing something funny this is very frustrating but as we have more and more satisfied customers we much rely on them to bring us credibility we continue to offer more benefits to our customers as of january 1st our new interest rate policy will offer accounts with less than 100 000 00 in net asset value interest on their qualifying cash accounts with less than 100 000 00 in nav will receive interest on their cash at a rate proportional to their account size an account with a full 100 000 00 nav will continue to earn the entire 1 9 we currently pay in the us while an account with a 75 000 00 nav will receive 75 of that 1 9 rate or 1 425 and so on we did this to encourage both new customers to open accounts with us and existing customers to consolidate any outside accounts at interactive brokers together with a growing suite of payment services such as direct deposit bill pay and the ib debit mastercard our goal was to make it more convenient and profitable for customers to leave their idle cash at interactive brokers most competitors we know of continue to pay very little cash on cash deposits in their brokerage accounts they pocket your interest we do not we want to give customers benefits that increase their returns and profits and therefore a positive word of mouth now i will go over our five client segments introducing brokers once again posted the strongest account growth up 45 over last year and now make up 31 of our overall accounts client equity grew 10 for introducing brokers and commissions rose 36 we see strong growth in this area because smaller and midsize brokers as well as international ones find it difficult to justify building and maintaining their own technology so they come to us to white brand our state of the art technology and to capitalize on our low costs as various countries and agencies increase their oversight of the financial services industry the regulatory and compliance burden only grows over time starting early in the fourth quarter we noticed that some of our accounts in asia particularly mainland china have taken longer to fund if they can fund at all due to constraints on their local banks regarding capital outflows our account growth for mainland china which was our strongest region dropped by about 70 in the fourth quarter we hope to see this improve after international trade issues are resolved over the next couple of quarters individual customers make up 49 of our accounts 35 of our client equity and half of our commissions they re a very lucrative and well diversified customer segment which saw account growth of 19 for the year commission growth of 22 and client equity growth of 1 the worldwide decline in securities markets in the fourth quarter impacted our customers account performance as existing positions in many of our accounts declined in value even as new funds flows into interactive brokers remained quite healthy our strong commission growth showed we were able to capture the benefits of increased market volatility it is interesting to note that the average age of our nearly 300 000 individual customers is 46 years ranging from eastern europe at 39 years to the us at 49 years this demographic bodes well for our future account growth and customer deposit growth hedge funds constitute 1 of our accounts 9 of our client equity and 10 of our commissions as of december 31 for the year we saw 10 hedge fund account growth and 35 commission growth while client equity declined 6 as most major markets weakened hedge funds are a large multitrillion dollar global market and we continue to have tremendous room to grow in this area proprietary trading firms are 2 of our accounts 10 of client equity and 15 of commissions for the year this group grew 7 in account 4 in commission and 1 in customer equity as we have said in previous calls we are well penetrated in this segment so while we expected to grow it will not represent our largest customer development opportunity finally we have financial advisors they are 16 of our accounts 24 of our customer equity and 16 of our commission accounts in this group grew by 11 commissions by 16 and customer equity by 5 our greenwich compliance group which provides registration and compliance assistance for new and existing rias continues to excel at signing up rias who want to open their own businesses going independent means rias can keep all the fees they earn in an environment where more advisors are looking to become independent our low commission and financing rates high rates of interest paid on cash and the availability of greenwich compliance s services have all contributed to driving growth in this segment globally investment advisors have about 35 trillion in aun the largest market segment we are in so we have plenty of opportunity in this area throughout 2018 we continued to improve existing products and to add new ones like direct deposit and bill pay when an interactive brokers customer comes onto our automated platform they can manage their financial lives with very little interference from us in order to be very low cost as interactive brokers is you must automate and so we have and will continue to automate everything we can this in large part explains how we have the highest profit margins despite charging the lowest cost and paying the highest interest rates on cash our automation because the core of our executive team including milan is almost all software developers everything that moves we try to automate the majority of our new customers come to us by recommendation of existing customers so the more we do in order for our customers to have a successful experience the more likely they will enthusiastically recommend our platform to other the more customers we onboard now the more customers they will bring to us in the following weeks and months with that i will turn the call over to our cfo paul brody who will go through the numbers for the quarter paul brody chief financial officer thanks nancy welcome everyone to the call as usual i ll review in this case fourth quarter and the full year results so we have much ground to cover main factors driving those numbers and then we ll open it up to questions let me begin by highlighting that our headline numbers for net revenues and pre tax income comply year over year decreases at 4 and 15 respectively but when we remove the effects on non core operating items primarily from the 2017 us tax act and our currency diversification strategy these measures increased 17 and 14 respectively i ll give more detail on this in my review of the financials starting with operating data in the fourth quarter higher market volatility and interest rates led to higher revenues on a firm foundation of growth in customer accounts total accounts grew to 598 000 up 24 year over year contributing to client equity growth of 3 despite declines in many global securities markets we saw growth in nearly all customer segments particularly individuals financial advisors and introducing brokers although regionally as nancy mentioned the tightening of capital controls in some parts of asia has slowed the flow of new funds increased market volatility and higher interest rates gave rise to higher commissions and then interest income respectively volatility as measured by the average vix grew significantly to 21 the highest level since 2011 and up from the level of 10 in the fourth quarter of last year increased volatility led to 21 and 34 increases in options and futures volumes respectively while stock shares volume was off 26 stock volumes were once again impacted by lighter trading and low priced stocks as a result of the shift the higher priced stocks the number of shares traded declined but the darts and commissions on those trades both rose finally fx dollar volumes fell year over year but recovered marginally from the third quarter with higher volatility and continuing account growth our total darts for the quarter grew 30 over the prior year quarter our cleared commission per dart fell 3 to 3 79 as higher market volatility led to more caution and smaller average trade sizes results from the full year reflected the momentum and operational leverage of our core brokerage business full year commissions grew 20 on higher volatility and trade volumes and net interest income from brokerage grew 38 as interest rates and average margin loan balances rose higher volumes were seen in futures and options and slightly lower in stocks echoing the trends of the fourth quarter for the full year total darts grew 25 while cleared commission per dart fell 3 to 3 87 as higher volatility in the first and fourth quarters led to more caution and smaller average trade sizes turning to net interest margins in our net interest margin table you will see that our nim widened for the fourth quarter to 1 65 up from 1 43 in the year ago quarter for the year nim grew to 1 62 up from 1 27 last year the main drivers were benchmark interest rates customer cash balances margin lending and securities lending the federal reserve raised interest rates again this quarter in late december making a total of four increases over the course of 2018 during the year we kept a relatively short duration on the us treasury portfolio and we recorded mark to market gains of 8 million for the quarter and 9 million for the year as market expectations of further rate hikes diminished we plan to hold these securities through maturity so these gains and losses are temporary but as brokers unlike banks gaap rules require us to mark these securities to market in our financial reporting outside the us interest rates are relatively unchanged with a few modest exceptions like the canadian dollar this moderates our expectations on rising net interest income as about 27 of customer credit balances are not in us dollars increased customer cash balances and us rate increases generated more net interest income segregated cash interest income rose 79 primarily due to fed interest rate hikes our fdic insured bank deposit suite program introduced just over a year ago has reached 1 7 billion and continues to grow and contribute to higher net interest income this program offers high interest rates in fdic insurance on up to 2 5 million of cash in our customers accounts in addition to the 250 000 of sipc coverage note that this revenue is reported in other income on the income statement but it is reported with interest income in the nim table margin loan interest grew 58 over last year from a combination of factors including higher average margin loan balances however as most major global securities markets fell in the fourth quarter our customers pulled back somewhat on leverage with average margin loan balances down 2 from the third quarter securities lending interest income was 51 lower this quarter due to several factors there were fewer hard to borrow high rate lending opportunities than there were last year especially in the kind of risk cost environment that we saw in the fourth quarter customer short stock value was down 9 from the prior year end reflecting the 6 drop in the s p 500 and also customers cutting back their market exposure on a sequential basis nim narrowed by three basis points primarily on declines in margins loans and securities lending income our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in us rates is as follows as we continue to experience growth in customer cash balances we aim to maximize our net interest income within the constraints of investment instruments permitted by regulations and per the liquidity and credit risk management expectations of further rate increases are typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest therefore in our calculation we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise in rates separate from the impact of rate hikes that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments with that assumption we expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional 15 5 million in net interest income on customer balances over the next four quarters and 15 2 million as the full yearly run rate the run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new higher rate turning to the segment results electronic brokerage produced gains in both commissions and net interest income for both the fourth quarter and the full year periods for the fourth quarter brokerage net revenues are 490 million up 26 pretax income was 311 million up 23 for a 63 pre tax margin treasury marks flung to an 8 million gain from the 9 million loss in the year ago quarter in the expense categories execution and clearing grow 33 to 69 million in line with trade volumes fixed expenses were 108 million up 26 primarily due to increases in employee compensation to expand the growing brokerage business the previously disclosed migration of expenses related to the winding down of market making increased legal and compliance expenses and contributions to reserves customer bad debt expense was 2 million this quarter demonstrating again the continued effectiveness of our risk management systems in limiting customer defaults even in the face of high volatility periods for the full year brokerage net revenues rose to a record 1 84 billion up 31 with pre tax income reaching 1 18 billion up 37 for a 64 pre tax margin fixed expenses rose 22 to 40million and adjusted for treasury marks pre tax margin was also 64 market making continues to consist of customer facilitation activities that will be retained going forward and options market making in several remaining profitable markets outside the us for which we continue to operate and evaluate for the time being for the quarter net revenue were 17 million of which 7 million were trading gains and the bulk of the remainder was net interest income market making pre tax income was 9 million for the year net revenues were 76 million and pre tax income was 34 million as of the end of 2018 we have nearly fully absorbed the 40 million of expenses that were projected to migrate to brokerage expenses from the customer facilitation activities are largely offset by related revenues and such activities should have minimal impact on margins if they are later absorbed into brokerage the corporate segment reflects the effects of our currency diversification strategy we carry our equity in proportion to a basket of 14 currencies we call it the global to best reflect the international scope of our business as the us dollar strengthened against most major currencies this quarter we incurred an overall loss from our strategy of 18 million of this 6 million is reported as other comprehensive income and 12 million in included in earnings we estimate the total decrease in comprehensive earnings per share from currency effects to be 0 03 with 0 02 reported in other income and 0 01 as oci for the year the overall loss from our strategy was 99 million of which 80 million was reported as oci and 19 million included in earnings the total decrease in comprehensive earnings per share from currency effects for the year was 0 20 with 0 02 reported as other income and 0 18 as oci turning to the income statement for the fourth quarter net revenues are 492 million down 4 over the year ago quarter that included positive impacts from us tax act and the global adjusted for non operating items net revenues were 496 million for the quarter up 17 over last year s 425 million non operating items include the 12 million loss on our currency strategy and the 8 million gain from treasury marks from the current quarter and most significantly a 93 million gain related to the us tax act recorded in other income for the fourth quarter of 2017 commission revenue rose 21 on higher volume in options and futures and as i mentioned earlier higher darts and stocks partially offset by lower average trade sizes in most product categories the modest decline of our overall average cleared commission per dart to 3 79 reflected this mix of our 243 million of net interest income brokerage produced 234 million market making 8 million and corporate the remainder other income which includes our global currency strategy treasury marks and other fees and income we receive was 37 million the non recurrence of last year s 93 million us tax act benefit and the modest decline in the global offset increases in treasury marks and in most other line items for the full year net revenues were 1 90 billion of 12 over the prior year full year adjusted net revenues are 1 91 billion of 28 over last year s 1 50 billion non core items for 2018 include the 19 million loss on our currency strategy and the 9 million gain from treasury marks in 2017 the primary non core items were a 110 million gain on the global and 93 million gain related to the us tax act and 11 million gain on the transfer of our market making business and a 12 million loss from treasury marks non interest expenses were 183 million for the quarter up 21 from last year the primary drivers were 17 million higher execution and clearing fees in line with increased trading activity as well as higher general administrative expenses largely stemming from legal and compliance costs and reserves for the full year non interest expenses were 707 million of 8 driven primarily by the same factors plus higher employee compensation and benefits at year end our total heads count stood at 1 413 up 15 from last year we have been hiring most aggressively in the area of the clients services legal and compliance and software development and to this end we continue to build up our operations in india for the fourth quarter pre tax income was 309 million down 15 versus last year which contained the non core items i noted on an adjusted basis pre tax income was 313 million up 14 over last year s pre tax income of 274 million representing an adjusted pre tax margin of 63 and for the full year pre tax income was 1 20 billion up 14 and adjusted for non core items was 1 21 billion up 38 versus last year s 872 million diluted earnings per share were 0 57 for the quarter versus the loss of 0 02 for the same period in 2017 without the impact from non core items diluted earnings per share would have been 0 58 for the quarter versus 0 43 in the year ago period for the year diluted earnings per share were 2 28 versus 1 07 last year and adjusted for the non core items including the us tax act in 2017 diluted earnings per share were 2 28 for 2018 and a 1 39 for 2017 comprehensive diluted earnings per share which includes all currency effects for 0 56 for the quarter versus a loss of 0 02 last year and for the year they were 2 09 versus 1 22 last year ex the non core items full year comprehensive diluted earnings per share would have been 2 28 versus 1 39 last year to help investors better understand our earnings the split between the public shareholders and the non controlling interest for the fourth quarter is as follows starting with income before income taxes of 309 million we first add 1 million of other income actually net expense in this case related only to the public company resulting in 310 million of operating companies income we then deduct 9 million for mostly foreign income taxes paid by our operating companies that leaves 301 million of which 82 or that 247 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non controlling interests the remaining 18 our 54 million is available for the public company shareholders but as this is a non gaap measure it is not reported on our income statement after we deduct that 1 million of net expense reported in other income from the 54 million and then deduct remaining taxes of 10 million the public company s net income available for common stock holders is the 43 million you see reported on our income statement our income tax expense of 19 million consists of this 10 million plus the 9 million of taxes paid by the operating companies our balance sheet remains highly liquid with low leverage with a record 7 2 billion in consolidated equity we are extremely well capitalized from regulatory standpoint and are deploying our equity capital in the brokerage business as it continues to grow we hold excess capital in order to take advantage of opportunities as well as to demonstrate the strengths and depth of our balance sheet we continue to carry no long term debt at december 31st margin debits were 27 billion a decrease of 13 from last year multi year highs in volatility combined with a down graphed in global securities markets especially in the fourth quarter led to our clients curtailing leverage as we noted in previous calls we also expect swings in marginal lending due to our success in attracting institutional hedge fund customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage we remain able to satisfy customer s willingness to take on leverage when market yields present these opportunities out of our consolidated equity capital at december 31st 2018 of 7 2 billion 5 8 billion was held in brokerage 1 0 billion in market making and customer facilitation activities and the remainders in corporate now i ll turn the call back over to the moderator and we can take some questions questions and answers operator thank you sir ladies and gentlemen at this time if you would like to ask a question over the phone please press then 1 on your telephone key pad if your questions have been answered you wish to remove yourself from the queue simply press the key once again ladies and gentlemen that is and then 1 ask the question our first question will come from rich repetto with sandler o neill your line is now open rich repetto sandler o neill analyst yeah good evening first i want to congratulate thomas for building an outstanding company and really setting the standard for the active trading platform that you ve built congratulations thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich repetto sandler o neill analyst yes the first question is just trying to get into more the details on the incremental interest expense when you re paying below 100 000 the accounts with 100 000 so we ve ball parked it somewhere between 20 to 30 million per year with the different moving part i guess could you help us since this is a public format is that reasonable and i don t know whether you could narrow it down any more than that paul j brody chief financial officer we did some yeah we did some modeling on that rich of course our estimate is with current balances and no changes at all it s a little bit under 20 million annual additional interest expense however that translates into only about 2 5 of balances that is to say if the policy attracts only about 2 5 of our credit balances as an increase then we break even and if we attract more than that then it s a successful policy rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it so 19 million on current balances then paul j brody chief financial officer 19 5 was modeling but it s only it had certain assumption that therefore take it as an estimate rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it and then i guess the next question would be on expenses over all is it still i guess the guidance has been expenses will grow somewhat at the pace of revenue or could you give us thomas i guess the overall guidance for expenses as you continue to try to scale up and build the broker thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i would expect expenses to grow 10 to 15 rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it ok that s very helpful and then my last question thomas is i guess we can see the head winds that are out there or some of the headwinds that you ve mentioned about the asia problem with money coming out of asia as well as the smaller trade size issue and you ve brought that up on the past several calls with regulators sort of giving that more scrutiny to the lower the stocks that the low price stocks and just to look at it from the tail wind side what other things besides volatility we know that helped but what are the things that you think can help overcome some of these the headwinds may be temporary hopefully but what you re seeing it keeps you real optimistic i guess just to review some of those thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i think clearly stated its growth it s growth of accounts that s what this business is all about accounts will keep on growing and were getting new accounts in all of our segments and it looks really good but of course at the beginning of the year everything looks good but this year is really looking good rich repetto sandler o neill analyst got it congrats again thomas and thank you thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of chris allen with compass point your line is now open chris allen compass point analyst evening guys offer my congratulations as well thomas it s been a pleasure to watch the growth over the years if i could just actually dive a little bit deeper into some of rich s questions one just in the asia pac region is it just china that you re seeing the impact or is it a little bit more broad than that and also is it i mean from your comment right now just before it sounds like 2019 off to a good start have you seen consistency in north american and europe and the other regions i e this is just a little bit of just a china us issue or are we also seeing an impact from the market pull packs that we saw over the course of the fourth quarter i mean both of which if we think of it longer term will fade but i just want to hopefully try to delineate between the two thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer it s mainly a china us issue and it s not only the difficulty of mainland china it s customers trying to take money outside of the country but it s also the chinese stock market as you know the chinese stock market has not done well in this past year and many of our chinese customers in fact carry chinese stocks with us so their account size or the volume of the accounts has diminished drastically because of their long position in chinese stocks otherwise as far as asia is concerned our econ growth has picked up in the countries outside and around china countries like singapore and hong king and other countries in the area similarly our econ growth is picking up in eastern europe and even in latin america so our while in the united states our econ growth is fairly stable at relatively lower rate of around even in the low teens in other places we go up in the 20 s and 30 s that s what we see chris allen compass point analyst got it that s very helpful and i think the other brokers would take mid teens in the us from an account growth perspective just wanted to ask also on the expense outlook the 10 to 15 one is that the outlook for the fixed expense base or does that include execution in clearing and two does that encompass new project that you guys are working on you guys are always working on something whether i mean i think you mentioned the goldman conference looking at potential for a bank in the us or outside just an example of things you think about but any color there would be helpful thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i was talking about fixed expenses execution is clearing and it is not under our control i hope it will grow by a huge percentage because it goes hand in hand with our commission income the greater the commission income the greater the execution expense we are basically focusing on keep hiring more and more people with expertise in software development especially and in compliance we hope to grow expenses this is not this is a pleasure for us to grow the expenses because that means that we are able to recruit the talent because we really need people to in order to make this business grow as fast as we can chris allen compass point analyst got it thanks a lot guys i ll get back in the queue congrats again thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of mac sykes with g research your line is now open mac sykes g research analyst i would echo the comment to thomas and congratulations milan looking forward to the next 28 years as well thomas we always look forward to your color in the markets and i just wanted to throw out a couple questions on that framework first we ve got an announcement recently about a new exchange the memx i know it s still early days i just wanted to get your feedback on the need for new exchange and what some of the dynamics that might bring also maybe an update on how you thought markets function in december in terms of passive in your systems and then perhaps an update on payment for order flow going forward in terms of market structure thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer this is a three part question that has only one answer basically as far as this new exchange is concerned i can only guess as to the motives and i think that maybe some brokers were given some heat about payment for order flow and so they are trying to transfer the business in which they give the hand over the orders to the internalizers over the counter they are trying to do the same thing now in officially registered exchange it s sort of looks better i think the business is going to be probably the same payment for order flow we do not see or expect any change as far as liquidity is concerned i think we are the more orders get purchased by internalizers whether it s on this new exchange or otherwise i think the liquidity lessens further because these orders never see daylight and obviously people who would who can limit orders of the exchanges are doing that in the hopes of getting to trade with some customer orders and that is not happening i think that liquidity is going to continue to degrade as payment for order flow takes a greater and greater percentage of the overall volume mac sykes g research analyst okay and then just one follow up on the china asia aspects assuming we do get a trade deal done in markets in china and that area kind of stabilize would you think that there s some compressed demand at this point that could so we could see kind of a knee jerk reaction in terms of engagement following a broader headline of satisfying thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i do not know how the capital controls are actually connected with the trade fight we sense that there is some connection we sense that the capital controls get harder as the trade fight gets harder but we cannot promise you that if the trade fight resolves itself the capital controls will be lifted we hope but there are certainly no assurances that we can give you on that mac sykes g research analyst great thank you so much operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of kyle voigt with kbw your line is now open kyle voigt kbw analyst hi good afternoon just another question on china if i could i think you previously disclosed around 16 of your accounts were from china just to clarify is that 16 a year mainland china only or is that a different account thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer that was mainland china kyle voigt kbw analyst okay and then i have one more on china and then i ll move to something else in october bloomberg reported that tiger brokers was considering a us ipo alongside another china based broker i know ib made an investment in tiger in 2017 just wondering if the potential broker ipos change anything for ib from a business perspective and then more broadly if you could address the competitive environment in serving mainland china outside of this trade dispute i think you made some comments earlier in the year about maybe new or different competitors likely to emerge over the coming years thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer we do not expect any changes as far as our business is concerned from tiger brokers going public maybe it will to some extent increase their business and since we do their business it would increase ours but i do not expect a major impact now as far as the competitive landscape there is we haven t seen any major changes there are these online brokers like tiger and futu and i assume that there are others that are forming in the background i expect that on the long run we will have more and more competitors or customers it s hard to tell which one if we succeed in getting them become customers of ours then it s good for us if we do not it s not so good for us but china is even though it s 16 of our accounts now i expect that as the rest of the world becomes more capital and investment conscious that percentage will either probably diminish somewhat kyle voigt kbw analyst okay understood another question for you thomas regarding the trading plan that will become effective in july just to confirm do anticipate potentially increasing the pace of the share sales and future trading plans or is that just thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer no i do not no kyle voigt kbw analyst okay and then lastly for me and then i ll hop back in the queue is just a question regarding the securities portfolio i think from the beginning of 2016 through the middle of 2017 you significantly shorten the duration of that securities portfolio just given that the market is pricing in a relatively low probability of the fed hiking again how are you thinking about the duration of that securities portfolio as for you were adding through 2019 thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer i think that well it s just my thinking that we may have a pleasant surprise and the economy could perk up and we could get one or two rate hikes in 2019 but don t hold me to that kyle voigt kbw analyst okay thanks a lot thomas operator thank you and just as a reminder ladies and gentlemen to ask a question the then 1 and our next question will come from chris harris at wells fargo your line is now open chris harris wells fargo analyst thanks guys the change in your interest policy how is it only affecting 2 5 of the balances i was under the impression that balance is under 100 000 where a much larger percent of the total paul j brody chief financial officer yeah maybe i wasn t clear when i said the 2 5 we re talking about is that based on that incremental expense under the new policy on the current balances if we were able to attract as little as 2 5 additional balances because we re paying more interest and we can get customers to consolidate more balances with ib if we were able to attract as little as 2 5 more that would cover the additional cost chris harris wells fargo analyst i got it paul j brody chief financial officer then any amount over 2 5 means it s a successful policy for us it s chris harris wells fargo analyst okay that s paul j brody chief financial officer a fairly low bar yeah chris harris wells fargo analyst okay clear with respect to the slowdown in the counts are you guys seeing any slowdown from your hedge fund customer group and i ask that question because there have been some hedge fund closures the fourth quarter was difficult from a performance standpoint for a lot of funds is that starting to make its way through your business or not thomas peterffy chairman and chief executive officer we have not seen that yet chris harris wells fargo analyst okay and then one quick last numbers question can you walk us through the difference between the net interest incomes you guys report on a consolidated basis versus the net interest income that s in the table it looks to be like a 9 million variance between those two numbers paul j brody chief financial officer yeah just conceptually there are elements that are reported as either interest income or reported in the other income line item on the income statement as according to what gaap requires and so there are interest like elements that might be related to for example foreign exchange swaps which we do on a very short term basis for treasury management and to improve our overall interest picture that effectively generate interest income but gaap doesn t consider that interest income so it might be reported certain line items as other income but we take all of these items for analysis purposes and bring them into the net interest margin table so that everything that s either clearly net interest or a net interest like line item are all brought together so that we could do the whole picture another good example is the fdic sweep program because technically it generates fees not interest and so on the income statement it s another income and then net interest margin analysis in the table it s in there along with interest income chris harris wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time it is now my pleasure to hand the conference back over to ms nancy stuebe for any closing comments or remarks nancy stuebe director of investor relations thank you everyone for participating today and as a reminder this call will be

meanwhile some economists believe this year japan is well positioned to attract a significant influx of foreign investment not least due to the expectations of a deeper economic cooperation with china and the us as well as due to the yen s status as a global reserve currency additionally japan s own investment in other asian economies are expected to bring in ever increasing returns due to a string of successful projects across the continent which some say could overshadow china s celebrated belt and road initiative read more japan s 3 5 trillion stimulus drives wealth polarisation hardly helps economy compared to china s state backed projects japanese projects are more resilient because they have a large number of financial backers analysts from the institute of developing economies a partner think tank of the japan external trade organisation wrote in a recent study however despite the expected growth in exports and the ongoing influx of capital japan is still facing risks related to brexit the us fed s tightening cycle and trade disruptions across the globe such downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be heightening recently and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms and households sentiment in japan boj officials said

lawmaker yvette cooper put an cross party supported amendment proposal earlier to try to impose a deadline of february 26 for prime minister theresa may to get the brexit deal approved by the parliament otherwise there would be a parliamentary vote on delaying brexit the second most influential labour member john mcdonnell said today the party is highly likely to back cooper s amendment he added yvette cooper has put an amendment down which i think is sensible however uk prime minister theresa may criticized that what we have seen is amendments seeking to engineer a situation where article 50 is extended that does not solve the issue there will always be a point of decision the decision remains the same no deal a deal or no brexit regarding no deal brexit moody s senior vice president sarah carlson warned that from a sovereign credit perspective if you end up with a no deal brexit that is a sign that something institutionally has really quite profoundly failed and that would weigh negatively on uk s creditworthiness eu moscovici brexit has to be dealt with in london first european commissioner for economic and financial affairs pierre moscovici reiterated the eu s stance that regarding brexit the ball is in uk s court now he said certainly the eu is there the eu is waiting the eu is ready but first we need to know clearly what are the british intentions and we need some clarifications from london he added that of course the door is always open for discussion but it s not up to us to tell now the british side where it wants to go the ball clearly is in the british side again it s not a problem that can be solved by brussels maybe in brussels later but it has to be first dealt with in london also on the possibility of hard brexit moscovici said nobody wants a no deal brexit that is clear the british parliament doesn t want a no deal the british government doesn t want a no deal and the eu is not willing a no deal so we need to explore all options which are not a no deal boj stands pat sharp downward revision in fiscal 2019 inflation forecast boj left monetary policies unchanged today as widely expected new economic projections are also

bitcoin zealots and enthusiasts were jumping for joy last week when a russian economist a professor ginko who works closely with the government announced that russia would soon be buying bitcoin before the professor could take a breath the news went viral he also noted that purchases could occur as soon as february of this year but paul goncharoff an american businessman living in moscow and a bit closer to the crypto action in the kremlin believes that this is highly unlikely highly unlikely or not there are serious discussions going on in the background that could prove very interesting down the crypto road according to goncharoff the fact that there is a very serious discussion on the floor of the duma and in the kremlin about crypto rubles is interesting though the rules and the concepts are being developed now as we speak within the russian government and central bank but this is not what the geeks of the world would like to see a peer to peer decentralized cryptocurrency he went on to add that a crypto ruble the way it was explained in the duma will not be open to the general public to mine it will be managed by the central bank it will be available to international buyers and traders as well as russian citizens it will be backed up the way the ruble is backed up by the faith and trust in the central bank of the russian federation it needs to be regulated its volume has to be controlled and that s the only responsible way to go forward there was no mention if the coin would be a stable coin but it appears to be the case one crypto ruble will be the equivalent of one ruble citizens will be able to purchase a cup of coffee or a number of other things like an apartment for example with this legal tender the trading of cryptocurrencies is still forbidden in russia even though the authorities permit a few banks like sberbank tinkoff bank alpha bank and others to convert cryptos from the local currency exchanges to rubles today the optimistic launch date could be this year but realists think two years out may be a better guess the speculation however has already begun as to whether there is a bigger picture to consider russia has been converting u s dollars to euros and gold of late it has been no secret that china has been pushing for an alternative to the usd as a reserve currency it has over 3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves estimates are that 65 of this figure is in u s dollar denominated securities which it is loath to sell the total of all global forex reserves are roughly 64 in the usd as well as u s debt deficits and capital account increase in the wrong direction the expectation is that the u s dollar might depreciate significantly in future a situation that many developing countries would prefer to hedge against could any of these crypto maneuvers be the first steps toward such a brave new world according to goncharoff it is still early in the process

the world is currently about 0 8 c warmer than in pre industrial times and is within one degree of the highest average global temperature over the past one million years the world is warming at a rate of 0 2 c per decade and given the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere there will be a further long term warming of 0 6 c moreover now with the likely loss of arctic summer sea ice the arctic ocean will absorb rather than reflect back solar radiation which may lead to an additional warming of 0 3 c taking into account these developments the world may be already almost committed to a 2 c warming relative to pre industrial times widely considered to be a critical threshold in climate change 3a 2 c warming is likely to result in widespread drought and desertification in africa australia southern europe and the western united states major glacial losses in asia and south america large scale polar ice sheet disintegration and the extinction of 15 40 percent of plant and animal species worse with 2 c warming substantial climate feedbacks such as dangerous ocean acidification significant tundra loss and methane release and disruption of soil and ocean carbon cycles will be initiated taking the course of climate change beyond human control according to james lovelock one of the world s leading earth system scientists if the global average temperature rise approaches 3 c relative to pre industrial times and the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide co2 rises above 500 parts per million ppm both the world s oceans and the rainforests will turn into net emitters of greenhouse gases in that event the global average temperature could rise further by up to 6 c making the greater part of the earth uninhabitable for human beings raising the sea level by at least 25 meters and causing the extinction of 90 percent of species and a possible reduction of the world population by 80 percent 4 james hansen the director of nasa s goddard institute for space studies and one of the world s leading climate scientists argued that to avoid a devastating rise in sea levels associated with the irreversible ice sheet loss in greenland and antarctica as well as massive species extinction the world should aim to limit further global warming to no more than 1 c or 1 8 f relative to 2000 according to the existing ipcc models this implies an atmospheric concentration of co2 no more than 450 ppm however in a recent study hansen argued that the ipcc models failed to take into account various potential climate feedbacks paleoclimate evidence suggests that if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization has developed and to which life on earth is adapted atmospheric concentration of co2 must be reduced to about 350 ppm the world s current co2 concentration is 387 ppm and growing at a rate of 2 ppm a year 5 it is quite obvious that the very survival of humanity and human civilization is at stake given the gravity of the situation many people including some who claim to have the socialist political perspective put their hope on an ecological reform of the global capitalist system insisting that such a reform is within the technological and institutional feasibilities of the existing social system the urgent and unavoidable political questions are is it at all possible for the existing social system the system of global capitalism in all of its conceivable forms effectively to address the crisis of global climate change and avoid the most catastrophic consequences if not what would be the minimum requirements for an alternative social system that will have the institutional capacity to prevent the crisis or if the crisis cannot be prevented to help human civilization to survive the crisis these are the questions that anyone who is seriously concerned with the global ecological crisis will have to confront one way or the other stabilizing the climate technical options to prevent or alleviate further global warming greenhouse gas emissions from human activities especially the co2 emissions resulting from the burning of fossil fuels will have to be greatly reduced the emissions of co2 in turn depend on the emissions intensity of energy consumption emissions per unit of energy consumption the energy intensity of economic output energy consumption per unit of output and the level of economic output typically measured as gdp thus co2 emissions economic output energy consumption per unit of output emissions per unit of energy consumption capitalism is an economic system based on the pursuit of profit and capital accumulation individual capitalists corporations and nation states engage in constant and intense competition against one another in the capitalist world market to survive and prevail in the competition and driven by the desire for greater profits or more rapid economic growth individual capitalists corporations and nation states are all pressured and motivated to expand production and accumulate capital on increasingly larger scales thus under capitalism economic output normally tends to grow except in periods of economic crisis on paper if energy intensity falls rapidly to offset economic growth then the level of energy consumption does not have to grow however all economic activities inevitably involve certain physical or chemical transformations and must consume some energy this is true not only for the material production sectors but also for the so called services sectors there is a physical limit to how much energy intensity can fall given any economic activity given the way that capitalist markets operate any decline of energy intensity tends to make energy products cheaper as short term demand for energy falls relative to supply cheaper energy products however encourage people to consume more energy in the long run thus falling energy intensity i e rising energy efficiency is simply translated into more rapid capital accumulation economic growth and rarely leads to absolute declines in energy consumption 6 in reality capitalist economic growth is usually accompanied by rising energy consumption since 1973 despite relatively sluggish world economic growth world energy consumption has been growing at 2 percent a year at this rate world energy consumption will increase by 130 percent between now and 2050 given these trends the emissions intensity of world energy consumption will have to be cut drastically or the scale of economic output will have to decline markedly if there is to be any hope of reducing co2 emissions to an appropriate level fossil fuels account for about three quarters of the primary energy consumed in electricity generation to reduce co2 emissions from electricity generation there are three technical possibilities carbon capture and storage nuclear electricity and electricity generation from renewables such as geothermal wind solar tides waves and ocean currents emissions from power plants using fossil fuels can be reduced if the carbon emitted in the process of electricity generation can be captured and then stored underground without being released into the atmosphere carbon capture and storage is likely substantially to increase the capital cost of electricity generation and reduce energy efficiency as the process of capturing and storing carbon requires energy there may not be enough good leak proof sites to store very large amounts of carbon the technology remains unproven and cannot be applied to existing power stations this means that at best it will take decades before carbon capture and storage is applied to a substantial portion of the world s power plants 7 nuclear electricity has very serious environmental and safety problems it produces massive amounts of radioactive wastes it uses uranium which is a nonrenewable mineral resource the german energy watch group points out that the world s proven and possible reserves of uranium would be able to support the current level of demand for uranium for at most seventy years and the world could face uranium supply shortages after about 2020 moreover given the long lead time to plan and construct nuclear reactors it will be difficult to replace the half of existing nuclear power plants that will retire in the coming one to two decades 8 electricity generation from renewables is not an environmental panacea the equipment and buildings required for renewable electricity need to be built by the industrial sector using fossil fuels and nonrenewable mineral resources relative to conventional electricity electricity generated from renewables remains expensive wind and solar the two most important renewable energy sources are variable and intermittent and therefore cannot serve as the base load electricity requiring substantial conventional electricity capacity as backup 9 with the exception of biomass renewables can only be used to generate electricity 10 electricity generation accounts for less than 40 percent of the world s total primary energy supply and only 20 percent of the total final consumption about one third of the primary consumption of fossil fuels is used for electricity consumption but two thirds are used as liquid gaseous and solid fuels in transport industrial agricultural services and residential sectors out of the total final consumption of fossil fuels about 40 percent is used in the transport sector 24 percent in the industrial sector 23 percent in the agricultural services and residential sectors and 13 percent is used as raw materials for chemical industries electricity obviously cannot replace fossil fuels as chemical industrial inputs in addition it would be very difficult or impossible for electricity to replace fossil fuels in their uses in sea and air transportation freight transportation on roads high temperature industrial processes and the powering of heavy equipment in industrial construction and agricultural sectors while it might be technically feasible to replace the gasoline fueled passenger cars with electric cars and passenger cars might be the crux of modern capitalist consumer culture the technology remains immature and it could take decades before the electric car dominates the market moreover as currently about three quarters of the primary energy used in electricity generation derives from fossil fuels and about three units of coal are required to generate one unit of electricity an electrification of transport industry and other sectors would tend to increase rather than decrease co2 emissions for the purpose of climate stabilization electrification of these sectors would not make much sense unless the bulk of the electricity generation has been de carbonized that is the conventional fossil fuels generated electricity replaced with carbon captured nuclear and renewable electricity even if all of the economic and technical difficulties discussed above were to be overcome it is likely to take decades before the world s electricity generation is largely transformed and it could take several more decades to electrify much of the world s industrial and transportation infrastructure by then global ecological catastrophes would be all but inevitable biomass is the only renewable energy source that can be used to make liquid and gaseous fuels 11 however limited by the available productive land and fresh water biomass cannot provide more than a small fraction of the world s demand for liquid and gaseous fuels worse recent studies reveal that taking into account emissions in land development and soil erosion fuels made from biomass actually emit more greenhouse gases than conventional petroleum 12 climate change and the limits to growth according to the ipcc report to limit global warming to 2 2 4 c relative to the pre industrial temperature it is necessary to stabilize the carbon dioxide equivalent co2e taking into account the total effects of co2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 445 490 ppm this would in turn require that global co2 emissions peak between 2000 and 2015 and fall by 50 85 percent from the 2000 levels by 2050 global co2 emissions have been growing at about 3 percent a year since 2000 if the current trend continues by 2010 global emissions would be 34 percent greater than the 2000 levels it follows that to stabilize the co2e at 445 490 ppm global emissions need to fall by 63 89 percent from the 2010 levels can these emissions reduction targets be accomplished under the system of global capitalism with its constant tendency towards accumulation of capital and economic growth table 1 presents several alternative scenarios of emissions reduction and economic growth that are consistent with a 63 percent reduction of emissions which would allow for stabilizing co2e in the atmosphere at 490 ppm assuming global emissions peak in 2010 and decline thereafter in other words the intent is to point to some possible combinations of changes in energy intensity emissions intensity and economic growth that would meet the target of stabilizing co2e levels at 490 ppm these scenarios while hypothetical and based on optimistic assumptions highlight the dramatic changes necessary to stabilize co2 levels they help to illustrate that no sensible goals of climate stabilization can be accomplished under conditions of endless economic growth and capital accumulation as is discussed above in many areas it is technically very difficult or impossible to replace direct consumption of fossil fuels with electricity nevertheless in all scenarios it is assumed that 50 percent of the fossil fuels final consumption will be electrified by 2050 moreover despite various limitations to carbon captured nuclear and renewable electricity in different scenarios it is optimistically assumed that 50 75 or 100 percent of the electricity generation currently using fossil fuels will be de carbonized by 2050 corresponding to average declines in emissions intensity of 1 1 7 or 2 7 percent a year respectively energy intensity is assumed to fall by 33 45 or 55 percent by 2050 corresponding to average decline of 1 1 5 and 2 percent a year respectively with a 33 percent reduction of energy intensity the world average would approach the average level of energy efficiency seen in advanced capitalist countries today with a 45 or 55 percent reduction the world average would be comparable to the energy efficiency levels of western european countries today 13 the observed levels of energy efficiency in the advanced capitalist countries result not only from some advanced technologies but also from the massive relocation of energy intensive industries to the global periphery this raises the question whether these efficiency levels can ever be accomplished by peripheral countries making the assumptions of global improvements in efficiency of this magnitude highly optimistic it is also important to recognize that the three factors assessed in these scenarios emissions intensity energy intensity and economic growth are not necessarily independent of one another certain changes in the types of fuel used to alter emissions intensity for example may adversely affect the potential to improve energy intensity or economic growth and vice versa however in the presented scenarios these problems are optimistically ignored given the assumed declines in emissions intensity and energy intensity one can then calculate the maximum economic growth rate that is consistent with the emissions reduction objective for example in scenario 1 assume that 50 percent of electricity generation currently using fossil fuels will be de carbonized by 2050 implying that emissions intensity declines at an average annual rate of 1 percent and that energy intensity falls at an average annual rate of 1 percent then to reduce emissions by 63 percent from 2010 to 2050 the average annual economic growth rate from 2010 to 2050 must not exceed 0 4 percent that is the economy must contract similarly in scenario 9 assume that 100 percent of electricity generation currently using fossil fuels will be de carbonized by 2050 implying that emissions intensity declines at an average annual rate of 2 7 percent and energy intensity falls at an average annual rate of 2 percent then the average annual economic growth rate from 2010 to 2050 must not exceed 2 3 percent it is clear from table 1 that the assumed declines in emissions intensity and energy intensity are much more dramatic than the historical performance of the global capitalist economy what the ipcc refers to as business as usual and the assumptions for all scenarios are therefore very optimistic nevertheless in most of the scenarios the world economy would have virtually to stagnate and in one scenario the world economy actually needs to contract absolutely and this is even assuming declines in emissions and energy intensity that exceed historical averages and dramatically so in the case of emissions intensity where the scenarios are based on a rate of improvement of at least more than three fold and up to nine fold the historical rates considering that the world population growth rate is about 1 percent a year only the most optimistic scenarios would result in positive growth of per capita gdp table 1 stabilizing co2e in atmosphere at 490 ppm 2010 50 scenarios relying on various declines in emissions intensity of energy and energy intensity of the economy and the rates of economic growth they allow annual rates of change source historical data for world economic growth energy consumption and emissions are from world bank world development indicators online 2008 and even with these highly optimistic scenarios on atmospheric carbon stabilization according to the ipcc estimate the world would still warm by 2 4 c relative to pre industrial times indeed the ipcc projections fail to take into account many of the latest developments the arctic summer sea ice is now likely to disappear and the arctic ocean will therefore absorb more heat an atmospheric concentration of co2e of 490 ppm will probably lead to a global warming of 2 7 c rather than the 2 4 c suggested by the ipcc report taking the world dangerously close to the 3 c threshold which according to james lovelock would amount to a global collective suicide by humanity if the goal is to stabilize atmospheric concentration of co2e at 445 ppm instead of 490 ppm then the global emissions need to fall by 89 percent not just 63 percent at 445 ppm global temperature would still rise by 2 c relative to pre industrial times some major ecological catastrophes would be unavoidable and dangerous climate feedback cycles could be initiated far more drastic cuts in global emissions would be required if the goal is truly to stabilize the climate and create a sufficiently large safety margin table 2 scenarios of emissions reduction and world economic growth stabilizing co2e in atmosphere at 445 ppm 2010 50 annual rate of change source historical data for world economic growth energy consumption and emissions are from world bank world development indicators online 2008 table 2 presents the alternative scenarios of emissions reduction and economic growth that are consistent with an 89 percent reduction of emissions the rest of the assumptions are the same as table 1 it turns out that the world economy would have to contract in all scenarios for scenarios 1 to 3 where the assumed declines in emissions intensity and energy intensity are clearly optimistic in comparison with the historical performance of global capitalism the world economy would have to fall by two thirds to three quarters after 2010 to accomplish the objective of emissions reduction the results presented in tables 1 and 2 suggest that under no plausible circumstances could the objective of climate stabilization be compatible with the endless expansion of the global capitalist economy however the capitalist economic system is inherently incapable of operating with a non growing not to say contracting economy the politics of climate change and the imperative for socialism could this author be too pessimistic is the ingenuity innovativeness adaptability and resilience of capitalism underestimated the spokespersons of the mainstream environmental movement such as lester r brown author of plan b and director of earth policy institute and amory lovins coauthor with paul hawken and l hunter lovins of natural capitalism try to convince us that magical technologies will come to the rescue solar panel costs will fall to the floor as energy efficiency will surge ten fold greenhouse gases emissions and other pollution can be reduced drastically while gross domestic product will keep growing explosively for them there is no inherent conflict between production for profit and capital accumulation on the one hand and ecological sustainability on the other their typical line of argument is that the technology is already available and all that is needed is political will by political will they are of course not referring to anything like fundamental social transformation instead they are talking about some legislative reforms and international agreements within the basic capitalist framework at most they would demand some limited changes in personal consumer behavior the mainstream environmental movement as far as its social composition is concerned mainly consists of people who belong to the upper middle class in a capitalist society they include the university professors engineers technicians managers financial analysts and other professionals although they typically do not own significant amounts of the means of production they play important managerial and technical functions for the capitalists and enjoy substantial material privileges relative to the working class in periods of revolutionary upsurge such as in the 1960s some of them could be rapidly radicalized and become various ultra leftists in periods of counter revolution they could become the most important ally of the ruling class in the offensive against the working people in the 1980s and 90s the upper middle class was an important social base for neoliberalism in many countries and they played a crucial role in the restoration of capitalism in the former soviet union eastern europe and china as the global ecological crisis deepens some among the upper middle class recognize or sense that the existing capitalist life style is in serious trouble and cannot be sustained indefinitely yet they are unable or unwilling to imagine anything beyond the capitalist system on which their relatively privileged material life depends they are not yet ready to give up their implicit political support for the capitalist class their living conditions and experiences are very much detached from those of the working class it is therefore difficult for them to see that only with a massive mobilization and organization of the working class could there be any hope for the social transformation required for ecological sustainability to be accomplished the upper middle class environmentalists as a result have to put their desperate hope or faith in technological miracles on the one hand and the power of moral persuasion on the other hand which they hope would convince the capitalist class to behave morally and rationally however the laws of motion of capitalism will keep operating so long as the capitalist system remains intact independent of the individual wills and against the best wishes of the upper middle class environmentalists sooner or later those truly conscientious environmentalists will have to choose between the commitment to ecological sustainability and the commitment to an exploitative and oppressive social system furthermore with the deepening of the global ecological crisis and the crisis of global capitalism in general it may soon become increasingly difficult for the capitalist system to accommodate the material privileges of the upper middle class while simultaneously meeting the requirements of production for profit and accumulation as i discussed earlier there are many technical obstacles to the de carbonization of the world s energy system brown and lovins have greatly exaggerated the potentials of technical change but even if many of the proposed highly efficient energy technologies using renewables become available right away their application will be delayed by the inherent obstacles to technological diffusion in the capitalist system in an economic system based on production for profit a new technology is intellectual property people or countries that cannot afford to pay are denied access even today hundreds of millions of people in the world have no access to electricity how many decades would it take before they start to have access to solar powered electric cars moreover unlike consumer novelties such as cell phones or lap tops which can be readily manufactured by the existing industrial system the de carbonization of the world s energy system requires fundamental transformation of the world s economic infrastructure this basically means that the pace of de carbonization even under the most ideal conditions cannot really be faster than the rate of depreciation of long lasting fixed assets considering that many buildings and other long lasting structures will stand for half a century or even longer the assumed rates of de carbonization presented in tables 1 and 2 must be seen as extremely optimistic from a purely technical point of view the most simple and straightforward solution to the crisis of climate change is immediately to stop all economic growth and start to downsize world material consumption in an orderly manner until the greenhouse gases emissions fall to reasonable levels this can obviously be accomplished with the existing technology if all the current and potentially available de carbonization technologies are introduced to all parts of the world as rapidly as possible the world should still have the material production capacity to meet the basic needs of the entire world s population even with a much smaller world economy scenarios 1 to 3 in table 2 would roughly correspond to a return to the 1960s material living standards however under a capitalist system so long as the means of production and surplus value are owned by the capitalists there are both incentives and pressures for the capitalists to use a substantial portion of the surplus value for capital accumulation unless surplus value is placed under social control there is no way for capital accumulation and therefore economic growth not to take place moreover given the enormous inequality in income and wealth distribution under capitalism how could a global capitalist economy manage an orderly downsizing while meeting the basic needs of billions of people economic growth is indispensable for capitalism to alleviate its inherent social contradictions the kyoto protocol requires that the advanced capitalist countries reduce their co2emissions by 5 percent from 1990 to 2012 figure 1 presents the co2 emissions of the world s largest economies from 1990 to 2005 14 the united states refused to sign the protocol and u s emissions grew by 22 percent from 1990 to 2005 among the signatories of the kyoto protocol japan s emissions grew by 16 percent and the euro zone emissions tended to grow since the mid 1990s uk emissions due mainly to its massive shift from coal to north sea gas have been on a flat trend ironically russia is the only large economy that has reduced emissions substantially since 1990 during a period in which its economic output and population declined russia s emissions fell by one third from 1990 to 2005 with an annual rate of reduction of 2 7 percent if the world economy were to repeat the russian experience three times that is toexperience the kind of economic collapse that russia experienced in the 1990s three times with a comparable reduction of emissions then by 2050 the world emissions would fall by two thirds this would only allow the atmospheric concentration of co2 equivalent to stabilize at about 490 ppm as is discussed above this would still fall short of what is necessary chart 1 co 2 emissions selected countries millions of tons source world bank world development indicators online since 1990 china s emissions and india s emissions have more than doubled and china has now overtaken the united states to become the world s largest emitter of greenhouse gases at the current rate china s emissions will double in ten years and india s will double in less than fifteen years the european union is currently committed to a reduction of emissions by 20 percent from the 1990 levels by 2020 all of this reduction would be offset by just one year of china s economic growth with the great chinese capitalist boom china now builds two coal fired power plants every week this means that every four years china will build as many coal fired power plants as currently exist in the united states what hope is there for climate stabilization with this kind of fanatical drive for accumulation what magical technology can make this kind of capitalism sustainable it should be pointed out that the chinese workers and peasants have not at all benefited from this relentless search for capitalist profit it is the transnational corporations who use china as the world s workshop and the chinese capitalist elites that have reaped enormous profits from this to a lesser extent the upper middle classes in the advanced capitalist countries have also benefited from the cheap consumer goods and services produced by the workers in china india and other parts of the periphery on june 14 2007 financial times published a quite bizarre article what is at risk is not the climate but freedom by vaclav klaus the president of the czech republic and the former leader of the anticommunist velvet revolution we are living in strange times one exceptionally warm winter is enough for environmentalists and their followers to suggest radical measures to do something about the weather rational and freedom loving people have to respond the dictates of political correctness are strict and only one permitted truth not for the first time in human history is imposed on us warming hysteria has become a prime example of the truth versus propaganda problem it requires courage to oppose the established truth as someone who lived under communism for most of his life i feel obliged to say that i see the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity now in ambitious environmentalism not communism this ideology wants to replace the free and spontaneous evolution of mankind by a sort of central now global planning the freedom loving president klaus who is apparently a good student of friedrich hayek then demanded that scientists have an obligation to declare their political and value assumptions and how much they have affected their selection and interpretation of scientific evidence klaus then assured us that advances in technology and increases in disposable wealth will continue and will solve any potential consequences of mild climate changes one has to admit that it does take some courage for klaus to defend freedom at a time when an important political consensus is being formed among the international bourgeoisie that the issue of climate change cannot be ignored any more given my own political experience and background in china a former socialist state like czechoslovakia i do feel some strange familiarity with klaus s position frankly only an extremely reactionary politician who has deep in the heart hatred of the working class and socialism could have made such outlandish comments in one respect however klaus is closer to the truth than all the mainstream environmentalists it does take global central planning for humanity to overcome the crisis of climate change if by central one is talking about self conscious rational coordination by democratic institutions the technical requirements for climate stabilization are clear the global energy infrastructure needs to be fundamentally transformed to be based on renewables much of the world s economic infrastructure will have to be changed accordingly agriculture will need to be reorganized to follow sustainable principles and to be freed from dependence on fossil fuels for fertilizers and machinery the entire transportation system will have to be re built with railways and public transportation operated by renewable electricity playing prominent roles the scale of the world economy will need to be reduced in accordance with the emissions reduction objectives all of these need to be accomplished without undermining the basic needs of the world s population it is clear that capitalism cannot accomplish these objectives if we do not want to undermine the ecological conditions that support civilization what else can accomplish these goals other than socialism with public ownership of the means of production and democratic planning so called market socialism is not an option both theory and historical experience have demonstrated that market socialism inevitably leads to capitalism those who object to socialist planning might argue that the experience of historical socialisms suggested that socialist planning would be inefficient leave aside the question that the future socialism would no doubt do better than the historical socialisms in democracy and economic efficiency given the extreme gravity of the global ecological crisis efficiency is simply not a relevant issue the real question is can socialism provide food education and health care to everyone on the earth we know that historical socialisms were able to and cuba is still able to accomplish this with quite limited material resources capitalism has always failed to provide food education and health care to at least hundreds of millions of people if the global ecological crisis is not overcome then capitalism will eventually fail the entirety of humanity is the choice not clear enough notes 1

many presidential candidates write books most are invariably forgettable the product of the same collaborative writing process that produces a major address but without the excitement of live performance an audience or a charismatic performer elizabeth warren is different she s written extensively as a prominent legal scholar focused on bankruptcy long before she entered politics she lays out ideas that she hoped would provoke or persuade rather than win elections much of this is fairly dry academic fare like 1999 s financial characteristics of businesses in bankruptcy co authored with jay lawrence westbrook and published in the american bankruptcy law journal then in 2004 she tried something different she collaborated with her daughter amelia warren tyagi a management consultant on a work of serious nonfiction aimed at a popular audience the two income trap why middle class parents are going broke the book is chock full of thoughts on a wide range of public policy issues but written long before warren s first run for public office or even before her campaign for a consumer financial protection bureau existed in its mature form it s much realer and more interesting than any campaign book it s an important read as the 2020 campaign begins because it offers unvarnished insight into the evolution of warren s thinking as she moved from being a republican in the mid 1990s to the left wing democrat we know today the policy ideas she espoused 15 years ago are considerably smaller scale than the platform she s developed over the past decade but the diagnosis that s led her to her current positions are all right there in the book a book that argues that the fundamental structure of the american economy has shifted in a way that loads the dice against middle class families she also frames the issue in some unusual and provocative ways that could end up hurting her with feminists or more optimistically broadening her political appeal to reach swaths of working class america that are open to a progressive economic agenda but more inclined toward traditional views on family life the context for the book warren s area of academic specialty was bankruptcy law a later warren book carried the scintillating title secured credit a systems approach and in that field she was a leading figure in one side of a long running dispute between two main points of view one school of thought held that american bankruptcy law was too kind to debtors and made it too easy for individuals to wriggle out of their financial obligations these bankruptcy hawks made a major push for a reform of bankruptcy law late in the clinton administration and while they came up short then they ended up taking another ultimately successful run at it during the mid bush years warren stood on the other side of the argument seeing relatively generous access to bankruptcy as a key strength of the american economic system a key point for the hawkish side of the argument was that the rate at which american families file for bankruptcy had been steadily rising a sure sign of profligate overspending and a need to crack down warren s book stems from her interest in empirical assessment of the causes of bankruptcy and led her to propose a thesis that was more striking at the time than it sounds today households were declaring bankruptcy not because of a collapse of spending restraint but because of objectively bleak economic circumstances for the american middle class in the age of trump of course concepts like a decades long period of wage stagnation are commonplace but that wasn t true in the bush years when the main viewpoint on the right and in the center was that household income had been more or less steadily rising warren s central argument in the book is that this rise in household income was almost entirely driven by the increase in the number of two earner families and adding income by adding a second worker she argues has very different economic implications than rising pay for a single worker in practice the book says the increasing ubiquity of two earner households leaves families in more precarious financial circumstances with more brittle budgets that were more prone to tip over into insolvency if a problem cropped up the basic thesis that middle class americans need help is a lot less controversial today than it was when warren wrote the book but the fact that she was thinking along these lines in the mid aughts is crucial to understanding her worldview to her america s economic problems have roots that far predate the great recession and that require something much more fundamental than a macroeconomic recovery the two income trap described the two income trap as described by warren really consists of three partially separate phenomena that have arisen as families have come to rely on two working adults to make ends meet the addition of a second earner means in practice a big increase in household fixed expenses for things like child care and commuting much of the money that american second earners bring in has been gobbled up in practice by zero sum competition for educational opportunities expressed as either skyrocketed prices for houses in good school districts or escalating tuition at public universities last while the addition of the second earner has not brought in much gain it has created an increase in downside risk by eliminating an implicit insurance policy that families used to rely on this last point is really the key to warren s specific argument about bankruptcy though it s the first two that would drive her larger interest in politics bad things have always happened to families from time to time in a traditional two parent one earner family there was always the possibility that mom could step up and help out when trouble arose if her husband was laid off fired or otherwise left without a paycheck warren and tyagi write the stay at home mother didn t simply stand helplessly on the sidelines as her family toppled off an economic cliff she looked for a job to make up some of that lost income similarly if a family member got sick mom was available as an unpaid caregiver a stay at home mother served as the family s ultimate insurance against unemployment or disability insurance that had a very real economic value even when it wasn t drawn on a modern family where mom is already working has no give and is much more likely to be pushed into bankruptcy by job loss or family illness unless it builds up a big financial cushion but most families of course didn t build up big financial cushions the main financial savings vehicle for the american middle class was the owner occupied home in the good school district but the only way to tap that asset is to sell it and move someplace less desirable disrupting children s lives and risking a tumble out of the middle class consequently families in practice try to deal with financial hardship by availing themselves of the wide range of consumer credit opportunities made available by the ongoing deregulation of the financial industry this combination of brittle household finances stagnant discretionary incomes and wide availability of poorly understood debt products fundamentally explains the runup in bankruptcies a book social conservatives can love a certain strand of the american right has long expressed quiet admiration for the book since its thesis can on some level be boiled down to the idea that feminists were too optimistic about the implications of women s mass entry into the workforce a recent column by matthew walther in the week says it would be difficult to think of any american politician not named rick santorum who has made a more reactionary argument than the one at the center of warren s 2003 book and he means it in a good way warren and her daughter clearly both anticipate and reject the notion that the moral of the story is that women should stop working writing that as two working mothers we confess to deep resistance to calling for such a move they say that they remain dedicated to the best part of the feminist movement the rock solid belief that women who want to work should have every opportunity to do so but the book does connect with social conservative concerns on a number of levels first and foremost it is grounded in a realistic portrayal of the fact that most people have jobs rather than careers and that for most modern mothers working is less a choice than a practical economic necessity second from the title of the book on down it is focused clearly on the problems of normative two parent middle class families and how to facilitate their existence and comfort rather than dwelling on the arguably more acute concerns of marginalized groups last and by no means least the whole premise of the book is that having and raising children is an important activity that should be valued by society taking issue with both free market dogma and the notion that family life is just a lifestyle choice on par with pet ownership or a hobby near the end of the book they concede that one possible takeaway from their advice is that people should stop having kids an outcome they deplore if the word gets out that families with children are nearly three times more likely to collapse into bankruptcy they write will even more women decide not to have children they say that they re not sure but denounce those who view parenthood as nothing more than another lifestyle choice not so different from joining a commune or developing a passion for windsurfing it s not exactly that these are sentiments mainstream democrats disagree with but the framing around sustaining middle class family life is certainly a different point of emphasis from the politics of lean in and shattering glass ceilings and while warren and tyagi are themselves accomplished professionals they are solicitous of the interests of people who prefer more traditionalist family arrangements arguing for example that publicly funded preschool should be paired with subsidies for stay at home parents warren s hard shots at joe biden another place where warren parts ways with the feminist establishment comes in the context of a fairly vicious criticism of then sen joe biden who happens to be a rival contender for the 2020 primary nomination warren s roots are in bankruptcy law and while two income trap offers policy ideas on a range of topics it s clear that bankruptcy and especially the industry backed push to reduce americans access to generous bankruptcy terms was the key passion point for her in terms of contemporary politics one of the most striking sections of the book is when she discusses biden s work on behalf of industry friendly legislation and slams women s groups for regarding him as a champion of women s interests women s groups have too few dollars and too little wo man power to fight every injustice but there is another lesson in the tale of the bankruptcy bill women s issues are not just about childbearing or domestic violence if it were framed properly middle class economic reform just might become the issue that could galvanize millions of mainstream women to join the fight for women s issues the numbers are certainly there this year more women will file bankruptcy papers than will receive college diplomas more women with children will search for a bankruptcy lawyer than will seek subsidized day care and in a statistic with special significance for senator biden more women will be victimized by predatory lenders than will seek protection from an abusive husband or boyfriend the point is not to discredit other worthy causes or to pit one disadvantaged group against another nor would we suggest that battered women deserve less help or that subsidized day care is unimportant the point is simply that family economics should not be left to giant corporations and paid lobbyists and senators like joe biden should not be allowed to sell out women in the morning and be heralded as their friend in the evening middle class women need help and right now no one is putting their economic interests first warren goes on to call out the hypocrisy and indifference of conservative groups that claim to put family values first while ignoring economic concerns any group that is serious about lowering divorce rates should focus on reducing the economic stress that strains a marriage she writes but in the context of her current positioning on the left flank of the democratic party there s nothing particularly interesting about her criticisms of conservatives while the ferocity with which she goes after biden and in a separate passage hillary clinton and elements of organized feminism in washington is striking warren wants tougher bank regulation writing long before the 2007 financial crisis or the ensuing great recession of 2008 09 warren was way ahead of the political curve in terms of criticizing the banking industry her focus of course was not on the macroeconomic and bailout related issues that would later come to the fore but the question of consumer protection the toaster analogy that would eventually become the centerpiece of her case for a consumer financial protection bureau makes its debut in two income trap the government she observes simply will not let you buy a toaster that experts deem to be unsafe even if the unsafe toaster could be cheaper to sell and more profitable to make you re just not allowed to do it and while the book does not specifically include the cfpb proposal the point of introducing the toaster analogy is to suggest that financial products similarly should be subject to paternalistic regulation aimed at protecting consumers from unsound practices predatory loans may not set houses on fire the way a faulty toaster might warren writes but they steal people s homes all the same america has had more than twenty years to observe the effects of a deregulated lending industry and the evidence is overwhelming it is time to call the experiment a failure at this point in her career warren wasn t calling for structural reform of the regulatory apparatus but she was calling for tough new rules not just to crack down on fraudulent practices though of course she favored that but more broadly to curb high interest lending she concedes that her ideas would reduce consumers access to credit cards and large mortgages but regards that as a good thing presciently warning for example that the then current boom in subprime lending to low income and minority households was likely to end in tears but what s interesting is that while warren the fierce wall street critic we know from congress is very much present in the book the more aggressive overall reformer of the american economy in some ways is not warren s agenda used to be less ambitious if two income trap were released today i d say it suffers from a striking mismatch between the scale of the problem it identifies and the relatively modest solutions it proposes tougher regulation of consumer lending would be welcome but obviously would not fundamentally address the underlying stagnation of income warren and tyagi writing in the early aughts nod in the direction of expanding health insurance but ultimately don t say anything particularly clear about it they embrace the idea of a more robust disability insurance program day care subsidies paired with tax credits for stay at home parents and call for caps on public university tuition charges this was before the big funding cuts that the great recession set in motion but these are basically small changes they even explicitly say that america does not need to build a quasi socialist safety net to rival the european model instead they put a lot of hope in a change to how public school assignments work more on this later which would probably not actually change things as much as they suggest one way to think about warren s political evolution over time is that in the 15 years since her book was written her policy ambitions have steadily risen to match the scale of her longstanding diagnosis today s elizabeth warren embraces medicare for all and investing large sums of money to eliminate tuition at public colleges altogether along with an interim step that could do a lot to cut prescription drug prices and while she s still interested in regulatory solutions and consumer protection she has much broader ambitions here as well including a much tougher approach to white collar crime and a plan to give workers a meaningful say in the management of large companies the theme that the economic system is rigged against middle class families is very much present in two income trap but the full agenda to unrig it was still years in the making but one of her key recent policy initiatives around housing has its clear origins in her thinking for the book innovative thinking on housing and education a key distinctive idea in two income trap is that much of the nominal gains of adding additional workers to the household have been eaten away by competition for access to good schools on the way up everyone wants what s best for their kids but there s only one best school in town and only so many houses in that neighborhood so as more families add a second earner to their portfolio the prices of houses zoned for the best school rise to the point where everyone needs a second earner to afford the house with access to the good school at the end of the cycle nobody is better off but everyone is more prone to bankruptcy due to the more fragile family financial situation on the way down families have accumulated an asset in the form of the house but to sell the house and tap the value of the asset means compromising on the kids education the last thing families want to do warren and tyagi float as a solution the idea that school districts should eliminate geographical preferences right now in my dc neighborhood houses located just west of 14th street are considered more desirable than houses like mine that are just east of 14th street because the westerly homes are zoned for ross elementary school rather than garrison elementary school but the truly desirable real estate in dc is west of rock creek park where the elementary schools feed up to woodrow wilson high school considered the best in the city families can apply to attend out of boundary schools and many do but strict preference is preserved for in boundary applications a policy that feeds into house prices and makes access to the best schools a function of economic privilege warren and tyagi s idea would capture some of the key benefits of the charter school movement choice for parents and a decoupling of educational opportunity from ability to buy a house in affluent neighborhoods without raising the specter of privatization or the defunding of the mainstream public school system it s not however something warren has championed as a senator in part because it s not clear how you d accomplish this as a matter of federal policy experts i ve discussed it with also note that the idea might be unworkable in practice as affluent neighborhoods could simply push to gerrymander themselves into their own independent school districts the thinking behind this education policy idea is however evident in warren s more recent work on housing policy like many progressives warren wants to push for more spending on affordable housing programs but she is also attuned to issues on the supply side and that simply pushing more money into the system could serve as a de facto subsidy to landlords that does nothing to ameliorate the bidding wars that have undermined middle class financial security so her proposed legislation includes meaningful efforts to try to push and prod local governments into allowing more homebuilding and break the cycle of scarcity a glimpse of the electable warren perhaps more than anyone else in the democratic field warren s prospects are haunted by worries about electability whether framed in gendered terms around likability or in more data driven terms that her 2018 reelection performance was a lot worse than you d expect from a blue state senator running in a democratic wave year but while two income trap does not exactly reflect warren s current much more ambitious post financial crisis policy agenda it does outline a version of warren that could be more broadly electorally appealing than her current national perception the warren of two income trap is fiercely progressive in championing the public interest over the bank lobby and her determination to clean up the political system but is also attentive to the ways that poorly designed social programs can have perverse consequences and she s very much not a dogmatic partisan or a member of any kind of establishment sharply critical of the republicans who pushed for the banks preferred bankruptcy law but also savage in her attacks on prominent democrats including biden and hillary clinton who helped them do it perhaps most importantly two income trap warren is offering a pitch for a progressive economic agenda that is squarely framed to appeal to people with moderate to conservative instincts on some social issues democrats often seem to implicitly cast the white working class as composed exclusively of men who wear hard hats and work in factories while women are all ambitious professionals trying to balance family obligations with the drive to make partner or shatter glass ceilings in the c suite two income trap by contrast speaks to the questions recently raised by tucker carlson as to whether unfettered capitalism is undermining the traditional family warren s core argument in the book is that shifts in family life over the past couple of generations have not been all for the good and that the explosion of economic inequality that s accompanied them is part of the reason both the ideas she espouses in the book around bank regulation and the ideas she s only later come to embrace fundamentally connect to this same theme that the kind of stable families conducive to child rearing that conservatives idealize fundamentally require a different organization of the american economy it s a framing of the relationship between the economy and family life that while broadly compatible with the existing progressive policy agenda is nonetheless pretty strikingly different it has drawn praise from pundits who lean right on social issues but more to the center on economics if warren could translate that praise into actual electoral support from similarly inclined voters it would give her a clear path to general election victory which in turn seems to be the biggest doubt primary voters have about her and perhaps most of all at a time when conservatives have by lining up behind donald trump seemingly forfeited the notion of traditional family values warren offers a plausible vision of how democrats could claim that mantle for themselves

level meeting in washington on january 30 and 31 by liu he china vice premier and robert lighthizer us trade representative the paper s tom mitchell yuan yang and james politi wrote but according to people briefed on the negotiations us officials cancelled this week s face to face meetings with mr wang a vice minister of commerce and mr liao a vice minister of finance because of a lack of progress on forced technology transfers and potentially far reaching structural reforms to china s economy advertisement top trump economist larry kudlow denied the report in a cnbc interview there was never a planned meeting there were no other intermediate meetings scheduled besides liu s visit at the end of the month he said there s no cancellations none zero the comments prompted a late stock market rally and the dow jones industrial average closed down 1 2 percent off lows of a nearly 2 percent decline investor sensitivity to trade talk headlines is only likely to increase as the administration s march 2 deadline for the negotiations approaches barring a deal by then tariffs on 200 billion of chinese imports will spike from 10 percent to 25 percent but there s a real chance the two sides head off new hostilities and it runs through the oval office as we wrote here this month president trump could even strike an agreement with beijing before he reaches one with congressional democrats to reopen the government the chinese are plainly eager to reach such a quick cease fire with growth at home slowing to a relative crawl the country can t afford a protracted war and as keen observers of american politics they know trump wants a win he can tout and that will reassure jittery markets advertisement in that spirit beijing made an offer this month to close the bilateral trade deficit the subject of trump s most frequent complaint about the trading relationship by breaking out its checkbook the offer per bloomberg news was to go on a six year buying spree to ramp up imports from the u s and boost their purchases of american goods by a combined value of more than 1 trillion over that period eliminating the trade gap in the process they may be using other means to sweeten the pot for trump the chinese government just approved five new trademarks for ivanka trump s company the ap reports trump officials responded by asking the chinese to do even better and erase the imbalance in two years bloomberg reported it s not clear that would be possible and the offer already likely runs afoul of world trade organization strictures still the prospect of the president jumping at that opportunity is worrying china hawks in his own orbit led by lighthizer trump s trade ambassador has expressed concern to colleagues and business groups that mr trump could accept a watered down deal that reduces the trade deficit but offers only symbolic structural changes to help end the trade war and lift the stock market the new york times s alan rappeport reports advertisement to the administration s hardliners the 1 trillion bounty beijing is offering is too cheap because they see the chinese doubling down on abusive practices to help them leapfrog the u s in a number of emerging technologies for example while the chinese have been downplaying their made in china 2025 plan their strategy for mastering ten next generation industries including robotics aerospace electric vehicles and biotech a new report from two american business groups finds they are quietly forging ahead full steam the wall street journal reports the 142 page report from u s chamber of commerce and the american chamber of commerce in china found evidence of a deep concerted and continuing effort by provincial officials to pursue the strategy the report gives u s negotiators more evidence to press for changes during talks with the chinese delegation chinese negotiators meanwhile are so far refusing to engage on the structural reforms trump officials are demanding advertisement on the question of forced technology transfers to chinese companies for one they won t acknowledge the existence of the practice much less haggle over how to end it per the ft they also argue that beijing s recent offer to improve market access for foreign investors in certain sectors and strengthen protection of intellectual property should address us concerns while preparations for mr liu s visit to washington next week are continuing the trump administration s refusal to receive mr wang and mr liao this week shows how large a gap still exists between the two sides positions indeed sen charles grassley r iowa the new senate finance committee chairman told reporters last week that lighthizer told him there hasn t been any progress made on structural changes that need to be made trump though gets the final word advertisement and he sounded upbeat over the weekend things are going very well with china and with trade he told reporters there were some false reports about sanctions being removed we have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the united states because of the sanctions and we ll see how it goes but i think china has been we ve really had a very extraordinary number of meetings and a deal could very well happen with china it s going very well money on the hill shutdown showdown deal or no deal senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky

possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward looking statements that we might make today we direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8 k that we filed with our press release and our most recent 34 act filing i ll now turn the call over to our president and ceo jim loree jim loree chief executive officer ok thanks dennis and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us as you saw in today s release we delivered a respectable fourth quarter continuing our trajectory of above market organic growth and delivering strong eps growth and solid free cash flow dollars and conversion as many of you know in 2018 we faced an unusual and sudden onslaught of large and volatile external headwinds most of which developed during the course of the year specifically pressure from input cost inflation fx and tariffs had by fourth quarter grown from our initial january guidance of 150 million pre tax to 370 million which at the eps level would have been about 25 dilutive to prior year eps had we not managed to offset all but 50 million of that with additional price cost management and other actions the fact that we ended up delivering 9 adjusted eps growth in 2018 on 8 revenue growth which included 5 organic is quite remarkable it speaks volumes as to how agile experience agile our experienced management team deals with short term adversity and operating environment challenges while continuing to pursue above market growth and moving the company forward strategically more on that in a few minutes but first a few words about the fourth quarter revenues were up 5 to 3 6 billion with organic growth of 6 tools storage delivered 7 organic with strength in all major geographies and business units the tools growth was driven by the continued rollout of the craftsman brand price realization and leveraging our portfolio of growth catalysts industrial delivered 14 total revenue growth inclusive of the nelson fastener acquisition and organic was up 4 for industrial the oil gas business exceeded our plan this quarter and delivered a robust 27 organic growth derived from increased pipeline project activity in north america our total company adjusted operating margin rate was 13 3 as volume leverage price and cost actions were more than offset by the impact of currency commodity inflation and tariffs security was a bright spot this quarter delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus a year ago the security team is energized and focused and we are looking forward to realizing a significant and growing benefit from that business transformation as 2019 unfolds eps for the quarter was 2 11 in line with expectations and now i ll turn to full year highlights full year revenues were 14 0 billion up 8 including 5 organic growth and three points from acquisitions excluding charges diluted eps for the year was 8 15 a 9 increase versus 2017 and our operating margin rate remained solid at 13 6 despite absorbing the 370 million of headwinds previously mentioned turning to capital allocation we continued our balanced approach once again in 2018 during the year we repurchased 500 million of our shares and increased the dividend once again the 51st consecutive year of increases from an m a point of view we closed on nelson fasteners which further diversifies the engineered fastening business into industrial markets we also announced the ies attachments acquisition and our entry into large outdoor power equipment with mtd as our equity partner we re excited to see these opportunities progress and fuel future growth in the coming years in summary 2018 was a successful year one in which we cut through challenges to deliver solid results this performance is attributable to the agility passion and dedication of our workforce and i want to take this opportunity to thank every employee for their commitment and their resolve because it is our people to whom we attribute this great culture and the passion to perform well in any environment they live our purpose every day with incredible energy and commitment as we enter 2019 the external challenges don t magically disappear however we are well prepared and positioned to tackle them in addition there are signs that the global economic growth is slowing and that the u s economy may soon be coming to the end of one of the most enduring recoveries in u s history we are leaning into these challenges and will leverage our sfs 2 0 operating system while deploying an impressive array of growth and margin improvement initiatives to once again be successful in 2019 the investments we ve made to support organic growth and our recent acquisitions have created the strongest pipeline of revenue generating catalysts we ve ever had during my almost 20 years as a c level executive in this company these opportunities will provide a foundation for continued share gain and can act as a buffer to the revenue impact that could result from potentially slower markets we will see benefits in 2019 from the rollout of the craftsman brand the largest product program in our history as well as the repositioning of the stanley and the stanley fatmax brands in the north american home center channel with these programs we are unlocking new opportunities for share gain by aligning our brands across core user groups within the tradesman and professional segments while leveraging our brands fully with our retail partners the response we have seen from our customers and end users with the craftsman rollout encourages us regarding the potential for 2019 and beyond our core and breakthrough innovation initiatives are stronger than ever and our innovation focus permeates the entire company we expect to see future revenue benefits not only from flexvolt which is a well traveled story but also from new innovations coming to market in tools fastening and other industrial businesses as well as security in terms of the lenox irwin acquisitions we re attacking the revenue synergy opportunities which will represent 100 million to 150 million of organic growth over a multiyear period as we broaden the distribution of these products around the world in the emerging markets we continue to deliver outsized growth and share gain and we are leveraging our unique business model the strength of our brands including stanley branded midpoint mid price point corded and cordless power tools as well as hand tool products and we re having immense success growing at two to three times the market rate and across both developed and emerging markets e commerce remains a key revenue growth driver for us this year it represents a 1 billion high growth business a channel in which we are the industry leader across the globe by a wide margin and turning to our recent acquisitions in addition to the organic growth opportunities i mentioned with craftsman and lenox irwin we expect to generate inorganic growth from the ies acquisition in 2019 for which we are awaiting government approvals additionally as i said earlier our mtd partnership is just getting started and we are excited about the future benefits from this relationship as part of the deal we have secured an option to purchase the remaining 80 in 2021 and beyond for an amount which should approximate seven to eight times ebitda this provides clear visibility to almost 3 billion of instant growth in the early 2020s at what will truly be a great acquisition price based on the joint value creation efforts under way between the companies so with all these incredibly robust growth catalysts we are in an excellent position for a successful march to 22 billion of revenue by 2022 in fact we are so well positioned that we are now shifting our near term emphasis from identifying and acquiring new growth catalysts to first continuing to execute the ones that we already have and then second focusing on margin rate accretion for starters we will leverage our 250 million cost reduction program which is substantially complete as well as pricing and productivity benefits in 2019 beyond that we are now in the process of developing and executing an array of margin expansion initiatives many of which are aided by applying modern technology such as elements of industry 4 0 and advanced analytics more to come at our investor meeting in may but rest assured this will be a powerful and substantial initiative that will generate future margin accretion and buffer our earnings and cash flow from the vagaries of economic cycles and the external operating environment in addition we have redirected our capital allocation in the short term to a deleveraging posture keeping the balance sheet in a prudent place as is appropriate for this stage of the cycle this will give us maximum flexibility in the future for opportunistic repurchases and for acquisitions as our long term capital allocation strategy of 50 back to the shareholders and 50 reinvested in growth remains intact so in summary there s a lot to be excited about with this powerful growth story and now adding the additional focus on margin expansion will ensure that the benefit of all this revenue growth makes its way into even higher growth rates for operating margin and eps and now i ll turn it over to don allan who ll walk you through more detail in the segment performance overall financial results and 2019 guidance don don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone i will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter tools storage delivered 4 total revenue growth with 7 organic growth and a three point headwind from currency organic growth included five points of volume and two points from price we continue to see sequential improvement in our price realization which represented a full quarter benefit from the price actions we executed during the third quarter the operating margin rate for the segment was 15 4 down from the prior year as benefits of volume leverage pricing and cost control were more than offset by the impacts of currency commodity inflation and tariffs the impact of these headwinds amounted to 135 million for stanley black decker approximately 90 of this figure impacted tools storage in the fourth quarter the strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each tools storage region and sbu first on a geographic basis north america was up 10 organically with strong performances across all channels u s retail and u s commercial markets both posted low double digit growth and our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid single digit growth north america s growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations including flexvolt the craftsman brand rollout and price realization the craftsman rollout is continuing to be well received by end users and our customers for the year it drove close to two points of revenue for tools storage net cannibalization we are excited and encouraged by the success we are seeing as we continue the rollout in 2019 more on that from jeff a little bit later europe delivered 4 organic growth in the quarter nine out of 10 markets grew organically an impressive performance as we did see some weaker market conditions in europe the team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of brands and expanded our retail relationships to produce above market organic growth finally emerging markets delivered 3 organic growth diligent price actions to offset currency headwinds lenox irwin revenue synergies as well as a continued focus on e commerce and the ongoing mpp launch continued to support growth in this part of the tools storage business these actions were partially offset by severe market contractions that we saw in argentina and turkey these two markets reduced growth by approximately 360 basis points and that is not unexpected given the recent foreign exchange volatility we ve seen in those two countries however latin america continued to be strong with double digit growth brazil colombia ecuador chile and mexico had high single digit or double digit organic performances additionally in russia india korea and taiwan they all posted high single or double digit organic growth as well now taking a look at the tools storage sbus all lines showed high single digit growth in the quarter power tools equipment delivered 7 organic growth and benefited from new product introductions and strong commercial execution flexvolt delivered a robust mid teen growth for the year while delivering improved profitability which is now in line with the overall segment average hand tools accessories storage delivered 8 organic growth as new product introductions the continued craftsman rollout and then solid performances within the construction and industrial focused product lines and of course the contribution from lenox and irwin revenue synergies all these items contributing to their growth in summary an excellent quarter and a very successful year for the tools storage organization with growth in every region operating margin for the quarter was strong at 15 4 as the benefits from volume leverage pricing and cost control were more than offset by what we saw around the headwinds in currency commodity and tariffs this team continues to be resilient and is acting with agility to return this business back to margin expansion in 2019 turning to industrial this segment delivered 14 total revenue growth which included 12 points of growth from the nelson fastener acquisition and a negative two points from currency organic growth was 4 and operating margin rate declined year over year to 13 2 as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation the dilutive impact from the acquisition of nelson fasteners and then an unfavorable revenue mix within the fourth quarter engineered fastening posted total growth of 14 which included the contribution from nelson fasteners organic growth for engineered fastening was 1 due to higher system shipments and fastener penetration gains in the automotive business which were partially offset by a decline in global light vehicle production the latest global light vehicle production for full year 2018 shows a modest retraction versus the prior year as demonstrated this year our fastener business can still grow in this environment as we increase the fastener content within our customers for the year our auto fastener growth was 6 over 600 basis points ahead of global production the infrastructure businesses delivered robust growth up 18 organically this was primarily due to stronger north american oil gas pipeline projects which contributed an impressive 27 organic growth in the quarter we also had modest growth within our hydraulic tool business finally the security segment declined 1 with bolt on acquisitions contributing three points of growth which was offset by an organic decline of 2 and unfavorable currency of 2 north america declined 2 organically as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were more than offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security europe was down 2 organically as growth in sweden was offset by weakness in the u k and france in terms of profitability the segment operating margin expanded to 12 improving 100 basis points versus the prior year the security team continues to make progress on the transformation plan namely optimizing our cost to serve while positioning the business to provide new and differentiated offerings to our large key account customers and to our small to medium sized accounts this quarter and the second half demonstrated an important first step toward stabilizing the margin performance of this business by delivering operating margin dollars and rate improvement versus 2017 we expect these transformation initiatives to gain further traction in 2019 as we continue to position the business for meaningful margin dollar and rate expansion and more consistent organic revenue growth in summary it was another promising quarter for security with the team delivering year over year margin expansion for the first time since late 2016 let s take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page i would like to highlight that we are presenting the 2017 cash flow amounts as previously reported and exclude the impacts of the new accounting standards that were adopted in january of 2018 we believe that presenting the cash flow results in this manner provides a more meaningful comparison of the company s operating cash flow performance similar to past years we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter our full year free cash flow performance was solid as we generated 769 million in 2018 cash from operations declined 158 million versus 2017 which was driven by higher tax payments due to the addition of the toll charge that was included within u s tax reform and we also had higher m a related payments we saw our capital expenditures increase by 49 million in 2018 as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity made technology investments to support functional transformation and industry 4 0 and invested to support our acquisition integrations this performance resulted in free cash flow as a percentage of net income of approximately 119 excluding the noncash net charges associated with u s tax reform free cash flow conversion was approximately 90 in line with expected expectations communicated in our october earnings call from a working capital turn perspective we delivered 8 8 turns in the fourth quarter a decrease of 0 3 turns versus the prior year this decline is primarily due to carrying higher levels of inventory to support the craftsman rollout and to a lesser extent the dilutive impact from the acquisition of nelson working capital management remains a key pillar of the sfs 2 0 operating system we continue to drive working capital improvements across the company with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions and eventually moderating the inventory levels from our tools brands transitions that are happening right now when we feel that s appropriate we are confident in our ability to bring our working capital turns back above 10 in the coming years now let s move deeper into our 2019 guidance we are targeting approximately 4 organic growth in 2019 with an adjusted earnings per share range of 8 45 to 8 65 up approximately 5 versus prior year at the midpoint the free cash flow conversion will be approximately 85 to 90 the free cash flow conversion is slightly below our historical performance and long term targets due primarily to two factors one we are expecting that much of the cash payments associated with our q4 2018 cost reduction program will occur in 2019 the second factor is the ongoing cash payment associated with the total charge that we ll see for the next seven years over the long term we are still confident that a conversion rate of approximately 100 is still achievable as we use our core sfs principles to drive working capital out of the system on a gaap basis we expect earnings per share to range from 7 45 to 7 65 which is inclusive of various onetime charges related to m a as well as some onetime cost related to our margin enhancement initiative that jim just discussed also including the ongoing security transformation turning to the drivers of core eps growth you can see on the left hand side of the chart we expect the benefits from organic volume to generate 0 30 to 0 40 of eps accretion the cost reduction program we executed at the end of 2018 is expected to deliver 1 05 of eps which is a net of a modest set of investments to support value driving activities such as industry 4 0 advanced analytics and our security transformation these items will be partially offset by 0 90 to 1 of incremental tariff commodity inflation and currency headwinds net of both carryover price benefits and new pricing actions implemented earlier this year in response to tariffs we expect a tax rate of approximately 17 5 which represents a 0 15 eps headwind year over year and then lastly the benefits from the mtd partnership and the lower share count partially offset by higher interest expense should deliver a positive 0 10 in eps i would highlight that we have included section 301 list 3 at a 10 assumption for the full year if this does increase to 25 it could represent a gross headwind of approximately 100 million before pricing and other mitigation efforts as you read in the release and heard from jim we are preparing to take additional cost and margin driving activities to insulate ourselves from this and other risks also as you know we always build a level of contingency to ensure that we can deliver our guidance and absorb a certain level of unknown market or external headwinds and we will continue to do that in 2019 i would now like to review one other miscellaneous guidance matter we expect the first quarter earnings to be approximately 13 of the full year performance this is about 400 basis points lower than last year the primary factor driving this lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of external headwinds particularly in tools which from a profile perspective are more heavily weighted toward the front half of the year this will cause the first quarter to show operating margin rate and dollar retraction as we have a headwind of approximately 125 million to 135 million net of pricing benefits which is nearly three quarters of the expected 170 million full year net headwind now turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within tools storage is expected to be at mid single digits in 2019 there are multiple catalysts supporting growth including core innovation continued benefits from flexvolt the lenox and irwin revenue synergies emerging market opportunities and the continued brand transitions with craftsman stanley and stanley fatmax margin rates are expected to be positive year over year we are expecting the external environment to continue to be challenging in 2019 presenting another year of large external headwinds as i just mentioned however we will continue to leverage multiple margin levers including price realization cost actions margin enhancing initiatives and volume to offset these headwinds and position the business for a return to margin expansion in 2019 with stronger performance expected for the second half in the industrial segment we expect a relatively flat organic performance reflecting softening conditions within the automotive end market we re expecting engineered fastening to be relatively flat organically with continued growth within automotive fasteners our systems outlook reflects a softer year as we have been seeing a more constrained capex spending environment with our auto customers in oil gas we are planning for low to mid single digit growth driven by stronger north american pipeline project activity and then hydraulic tools growth will be relatively flat due to slower market conditions in that space we expect operating margins to be flat year over year with productivity and cost actions offset by commodity inflation and tariffs in our industrial segment finally in the security segment we re expecting the organic growth to be up low single digits in 2019 as the team continues to execute its transformation strategy this should translate into improved operating margins year over year as we continue to stabilize margins and deliver on our initiatives to lower our cost to serve so in summary 4 organic growth 4 to 6 adjusted eps expansion despite a two point tax headwind a solid result and a balanced view that acknowledges the current market condition and today s view of the external headwinds which are front half loaded we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for success in 2019 despite a very dynamic operating environment we remain focused on our organic growth catalysts margin expansion initiatives strong free cash flow generation and successful acquisition integrations with that i will like to turn the call over to jeff jeff ansell executive vice president president thank you don i would like to provide a few more points on the tools storage performance for the year including updates on our strategic brand partnerships for craftsman and stanley we closed 2018 with high single digit organic growth enabled by record setting new product launches best in class commercial partnerships and integration excellence as evidence irwin lenox and waterloo have delivered double digit organic growth since becoming part of stanley black decker adding to the strong acquisitive performance is craftsman which is exceeding both our and our customers expectations we re on track to 1 billion in revenue growth by 2021 seven years ahead of schedule this progress is being driven by strong user acceptance as such we have achieved a 4 6 star rating across well over 1 000 products and outstanding in store execution by both lowes and ace we also announced last quarter that the home depot will now be the exclusive home improvement retailer for stanley and stanley fatmax hand tools storage product portfolios both in store and online beginning this year the product will begin to ship in the front half of 2019 now i ll turn the call back over to jim to wrap up today s presentation jim loree chief executive officer thank you jeff in summary 2018 was a year of solid performance despite the volatile external environment as we said we delivered 8 total revenue growth including 5 organic net om rate remained robust at 13 6 and adjusted eps grew by 9 our teams acted with speed and agility while facing into and overcoming an unprecedented impact from currency commodity and tariff headwinds and while these headwinds will gradually abate as 2019 unfolds they will be with us for a while and the economic growth backdrop also looks to be slowing as well so with that as context we are pleased that our 2019 outlook calls for 4 organic growth with a 4 to 6 eps expansion and we feel good about that we remain focused on delivering above market organic growth with operating leverage reenergizing our focus on margin expansion continuing to successfully execute our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow and as always our seasoned leadership team will act with agility and leverage sfs 2 0 and all available avenues to maximize our value creation for shareholders in other news today we are announcing that stanley black decker was named to the carbon disclosure a list for both climate change and water this great recognition is an honor and it underscores our commitment to continue to conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner i would like to thank my senior management team and all of our stanley black decker associates around the world as well as all our stakeholders including the investment community for your support we are looking forward to another successful year in 2019 and continuing our pursuit of strong financial performance pervasive innovation and social responsibility thank you and with that we are now ready for q a dennis questions and answers operator dennis lange vice president of investor relations great thanks jim shannon we can now open the call to q a please thank you operator thank you our first question comes from rich kwas with wells fargo securities your line is open rich kwas wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning jim don first on jim so focus on deleveraging here kind of base level for capital deployment doesn t seem like this is going to be a year of meaningful m a what would you characterize given where we are in the cycle of the puts and takes consideration in terms of additional m a and then don real quick on the free cash flow conversion and the over underlying conservatism in the guidance if you could make some comments on conservatism and then second on fcf is there any working capital headwind with regard to the transition of the stanley brand to home depot thanks jim loree chief executive officer ok it s jim i ll start at this point in the cycle our plan is to kind of go in strong stay strong and emerge stronger and that s exactly what we did in 08 09 if you recall those that followed us for a long time when we went into this the cycle we actually had our balance sheet in great shape and we continued to maintain as much operating margin and cash flows we could squeeze out of the company even though the revenues were down a little bit and in 09 at the tail end of all that chaos we actually negotiated the black decker transaction and transformed the company subsequently now i m not suggesting that we have any plans to do that such a transaction again but what i will say is that it s really amazing when you come out of the end of the cycle and look at all the opportunities that are out there large and small that derived from others who had not maintained themselves in the same manner during that downward part of the cycle so with that debt to ebitda right now is about 2 6 times and we are deleveraging this year we may do one or two very small emerging market transactions but that would be about it and i d say by the end of 19 we re going to be in really great shape from a balance sheet perspective we are already but even better shape and then we ll see where we go from there don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer so to your second question rich on free cash flow conversion for 2019 guidance i mentioned the two items that are resulting us being in 85 to 90 with one being the total charge and then the other being m a or restructuring related payments associated with the fourth quarter charge that we took of about 100 million so most of that cash outflow will happen in 2019 on the working capital front we don t actually see a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019 because we do have to continue to work through these brand transitions that we ve discussed throughout the last year related to craftsman but now also related to what s happening with stanley and stanley fatmax in the home depot and we have to make sure that we have the right level of inventory to meet the needs of our customers and we re not going to get overly aggressive in our supply chain until we work through those transitions so we re not counting on a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019 but as i mentioned once we work through that we can regulate and moderate to the levels that are more historical for us and begin to work our way back to 10 turns over the next few years operator thank you our next question comes from tim wojs with baird your line is open tim wojs robert w baird co analyst yes hey guys good morning i have a quick two parter i guess first could you just talk about within the tools growth guidance what is embedded in there in terms of accretion from craftsman and the stanley hand tool changes and then secondly i was just the cadence of q1 margins being lower is the implication that tools margins be positive through the remainder of 2019 just want to clarify that don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so if you think about tools storage organic growth we said mid single digits so you interpret what that but it can range anywhere from 4 to 6 so it s probably leaning toward closer to the high end of that range within there we see craftsman performance net of cannibalization so when we talk craftsman net of cannibalization we re including the impacts of what s happening with stanley and stanley fatmax and porter cable coming out of lowe s we believe that impacts probably two to three points in 2019 and so that kind of gives you a gauge of where we think it is so it s relatively close to what we experienced in 2018 maybe a little bit better the second question was related to what was the second question dennis dennis lange vice president of investor relations first quarter margins don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer first quarter margins so yes what it does imply as we look at the second third and fourth quarter we would expect to start to see in the tools business margin rate and dollar expansion year over year so the first as i mentioned a significant amount of that net headwind of 170 million 125 million to 135 million is happening in the first quarter so that s a dramatic impact to the first quarter which makes sense given the timing of the headwinds last year operator thank you our next question comes from jeffrey sprague with vertical research partners your line is open jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone jim i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what the kind of other margin enhancement actions you are taking i assume those are above and beyond the q4 restructuring and then also just maybe as a follow on to that last question it would seem you would still expect actual adjusted eps to probably be down on a year over year basis in the second quarter is that correct jim loree chief executive officer you take the second part don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer ok yes yes it s not true jeff that we actually expect adjusted eps to grow because we do have a low tax rate again in the second quarter and we had one last year so that s it s a bit of a headwind but it s not a significant headwind and we do expect om dollars to grow year over year jim loree chief executive officer ok and on the margin enhancements i ll give you a little appetizer i think the main course we ll serve up at the analyst meeting but essentially we ve as soon as we completed the work in the fourth quarter on the cost takeout the near term cost takeout we said to ourselves our margins are under attack from these headwinds we need to get back what we ve lost already so that 250 million will help but what if we get more of the same what if we the down what if we go into a downturn in back half of 19 or in 20 and so we said we really need to basically create some protection for call them black swans or economic cyclical aspects and also our objective here is to grow our operating margins by 50 basis points a year obviously that didn t happen in 2018 and we re committed to do that so we need a way to get there and we thought about this and we said 22 22 we re two years in we ve done enough deals now and they re every one of them is a deal that we d do over again if we could we love these deals we ve done enough so that we can actually see our way pretty much to 22 22 from a revenue point of view now let s figure out how we can make sure that we get the margin to go with it to create operating leverage so that we really get that double benefit of lots of revenue growth and margin expansion at the same time and so we ve been working a lot on different elements of digital technology and how that can be used to create value in our company both from a value proposition point of view in our products in our business models but also in our functional processes and so on and it really occurred to us that if we could accelerate many of these things that we re working on and put some serious accelerated focus on them that we started adding up the benefits from these various initiatives like industry 4 0 advanced analytics procurement 2 0 and indirect cost management the technologies that exist today to use analytics to really do those in a manage those various topics in a much more efficient manner is really compelling and so we ve been experimenting with some of that and we feel confident now that we have something that can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit over a two to three year period and we ll figure out what the exact amount is and we ll share that with you in may but it s a very large number and it s a very focused initiative we re going to run it like an acquisition integration with governance and like i said earlier we re going to focus on executing the growth initiatives that we already have and we re going to focus on margin expansion and i think the combination of those two things is going to be incredibly powerful operator thank you our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays your line is open julian mitchell barclays investment bank analyst hi good morning maybe just a quick update on what the sort of delta is in your earnings guidance versus previously the commentary around high single digit growth is it simply about a point or so less volume growth assumption or has anything changed in terms of your confidence around pricing initiatives particularly in tools don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say that there s certainly a point difference in growth as you mentioned versus just looking at the markets as they play out in the fourth quarter and the view of u s housing and the automotive space for production just feels like there s still growth there but it s slowing so that s certainly one factor we do have a little bit bigger tax headwind as well because we did come in lower for 2018 so that s a little bit of a headwind in addition and then the third thing is we need to continue to monitor the impact of all the price in the markets and like we said in october we re putting a fair amount of price actions into the market we re going to manage this both looking at what s the right thing to do for price and what s the right action to ensure we have the right level of volume and we re going to manage those in concert with each other to achieve the right outcomes so as we continue to do that there will be a little bit of pressure probably in the margin rate versus previous expectations and we saw that play out in the fourth quarter but those are really the three main factors operator thank you our next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan your line is open michael rehaut j p morgan analyst hi thanks good morning just a little bit more detail if possible around some of the moving pieces of 19 guidance and obviously appreciate all the help so far first on the margin i m sorry quarterly cadence with the biggest hit of the commodity inflation being in the first quarter are we to understand that the reason you have the confidence that you ll switch to operating margin positive in the remaining quarters is because of the cost actions that have already been put in place or is there some amount of price realization as well that you re still expecting and secondly also on the deleveraging how are we to think of share buyback for 19 when you talk about the benefit that you expect from lower shares is that just the flow through from what you ve done in 18 or is there anything incremental in 19 don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so the cadence of the quarter is clearly the biggest impact in the second quarter is going to be the headwinds going down dramatically year over year as we begin to annualize those headwinds in the second quarter if you remember in 2018 we certainly vividly remember the timing of all this but as we went into march and april we began to see commodity prices increase we got into may and we saw fx shift dramatically and in then june we saw tariffs come onto the scene so in the second quarter we saw significant ramp up of the headwinds and that continued into the third quarter so as we get to the end of the second quarter and into july we will have comped a lot of those headwinds and so you look at that aspect and then you look at the impact of the cost reductions which the impact is relatively even across the four quarters and so it s about 60 million per year per quarter i m sorry and therefore you got that impact combined with a lower level of headwinds year over year because of that comp issue is really why we believe we can grow our operating margin in the second quarter jim loree chief executive officer and also the fact that the pricing actions are kind of accumulating over time and getting bigger every quarter sequentially and so that has a benefit too especially as we get into second quarter of 2019 operator thank you our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research your line is open nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning guys just want to just unpackage your outlook for 4 to 6 so let s call it 5 tools storage growth in 19 roughly how does that shake out between north america europe rest of the world and what would your estimate be for market growth in north america in 19 jeff ansell executive vice president president i think the actual range don provided was probably 4 to 6 said it was probably going to be a little bit on the more toward the high side of that so i think that s what we re looking at for the over the course of 19 and i think you ll see that we re absolutely committed to growth in all markets so you look at growth we ll have growth in north america we ll have growth in europe we ll have growth in the global emerging markets consistent with what we had this year of those three probably the leading growth contender will be north america as it was in 18 but we re getting growth in both of those other places as well and we think with that estimate we ll grow above the market therefore representing market share gain again in 2019 consistent with what we had in 18 jim loree chief executive officer yes and i think we all know that the european economy had slowed quite a bit germany went negative the u k is in chaos and confusion with brexit italy is a disaster and despite all that our european outlook for tools is going to decent it ll be probably 2 to 4 kind of growth so it s still continuing to forge ahead in europe and then emerging markets we have some specific markets that are challenged right now as almost as we almost always do i think in this case turkey is tough argentina is really difficult and we had major currency devaluations in those markets but also just the economies themselves are really difficult so we might see a little bit slower growth in emerging markets this year than we did last year but still we re going to be significantly positive and we ll be running at least three times higher than the overall market growth operator thank you our next question comes from susan maklari with credit suisse your line is open susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning i just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you re thinking in terms of some of the commodity inputs we ve seen some of those pull back in the later parts of 2018 what s embedded in the forecast from that perspective for 2019 don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i talked about net headwinds of 170 million if you break that down a little bit the gross headwind is about 320 million and you have an offsetting price impact of 150 million of that 320 million approximately half of that is commodity inflation so it s a significant number we have seen positive trends around certain commodities for sure but we do have to remember that a lot of the commodities that we get are really engineering grade commodities and we haven t seen as much of a movement in those commodities versus some other more straightforward commodities in steel in particular so we ve seen a little bit of benefit since december and as we continue to look at this it may continue to trend in the right direction and it could result in an opportunity for us as the year goes on but at this stage we actually have not seen a dramatic movement in the commodities that we buy because we tend to buy at the higher end of the grades and as a result that hasn t moved as much as some of the other commodities but the trends are positive which we feel good about right now operator thank you our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley your line is open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys just a question on the bridge i know that there s kind of a lot of moving parts here and maybe with the outstanding numbers from 3q could use a little bit of an update i guess the real delta here would seem that a normal organic growth if the right number is kind of a 20 incremental margin you guys seem to be closer to 10 and there looks like there s been at least on the surface some slippage in that 250 million of cost reduction and a lot of that soaks up the relief that you ve gotten on tariffs or baking in list three at 10 is that kind of the rough math of it because i guess both of those numbers both the headwind and the tailwind seemed a little bit lower than what i would have thought on the surface just to start out don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think on the leverage front you probably have to really look at it on a volume basis versus total organic so if you look at volume you can use an assumption like 20 25 that kind of gets you to the numbers that we re talking about and then there s a separate price benefit that s netted in the headwinds that we ve laid out for guidance and for actual results because we really dissected that because pricing can kind of mute the leverage numbers or change the leverage numbers quite a bit and as a result you re better off looking at them in those separate categories operator thank you our next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning guys so i guess just a couple one is kind of a box ticking item on the margin enhancement initiatives could that possibly give upside to second half with respect to payback or is that more of a 2020 payback and then if you could just talk about the impact of what s going on at sears on your craftsman rollout expectations jim loree chief executive officer ok well it s jim i ll have jeff handle the second question and on the margin enhancement initiative the benefit that we re going to see from that is going to be recognized over a two to three year period we re going to do everything we can we re going to work really hard to try to bring some benefit into 2019 as an insurance policy and it s not clear that it s going to be a huge number but i think it s there s probably something there and we ll go after it jeff ansell executive vice president president regarding the question relative to sears i think it s really based on everything that has just occurred in the last two weeks you d say it s very much business as usual if you look at the trend over the last at least 36 months that company would typically announce a closure plan following holiday sales and that would be updated over the course of the year to include more and more stores this year it s not much different so the fact that those stores will remain in operation at a lower count than the prior year etc is very consistent with what s happened in the prior years so we expect that our craftsman rollout will continue to take share as that presence atrophies in the marketplace so not that different than any other prior year operator thank you our next question comes from michael wood with nomura instinet your line is open michael wood nomura securities analyst hi good morning if we take into account craftsman accretion to growth and what where we think you re running at for price it seems like there s not much organic growth outside of craftsman in tools storage volumes you seem to be tracking well above that currently so i m curious what is explaining the deceleration in that lack in the business ex craftsman and does that concern you jim loree chief executive officer well i think that we try to make it very clear that the economic backdrop is one of slowing growth it s nothing to do with our market share our market share continues to outperform the market and i think the reality is setting in hopefully not just us but most industrial companies are facing slower economic growth in the united states in china in pretty much most parts of europe and the emerging markets i mean essentially the whole world except for a few bright spots like india for example but the reality is that economic growth that we see for 2019 and is pretty is probably a good point lower than it has been in the recent couple of years and then on top of that it s no secret that the construction markets in the united states have slowed as well so baked into our guidance is a reality check on the slowing markets it s not catastrophic it s nothing that we can t handle but our long term growth objectives are 4 to 6 we re putting 4 out there at a time when economic growth is slowing makes perfect sense to me don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and at the end of the day we think that s the right thing to do for all the reasons that jim articulated but any chance we re wrong the markets are a little better then we ll all be happy but this is the right approach given the signals that we ve seen in housing the signals that we ve seen in the automotive production space they re all showing growth for the most part except for auto production looks like it s going to be down next year but they re slowing and we have to be realistic about what the trends are right now jeff ansell executive vice president president maybe one last addition would be if you look at 2018 our growth was 6 to 7 in tools in a market that grew slower than that that market we think is going to be compressed by about a point this coming year and our growth looks pretty similar to that 5 to 6 so our growth rates will still be accretive to market growth although the market s growing just a little bit slower that s kind of it operator thank you our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone just maybe following up on that a little bit jim and the slowing that you saw that you re expecting to see in the u s i mean tools storage still put up 10 organic in north america and so can you talk about whether you started to see slowing in 4q as the quarter progressed and then i guess my second question for don in talking through that 250 million cost benefit number did you recognize any of that in 2018 and what s the cadence of that number as we progress through 2019 jim loree chief executive officer ok i ll take the first part the slowing in the tools market i think started in the third quarter concurrent with the interest rates increases that were being implemented by the fed and we saw the same thing in automotive as well the interest rate sensitive type markets housing automotive impacted by rising interest rates and it continued in the fourth quarter we were thinking well maybe it s an anomaly in the third quarter sometimes you get those for a couple of months or a couple yes a couple of months and it really did continue into the fourth quarter pretty steady in the sense that it didn t get worse it s just kind of felt a little bit more anemic in the third quarter and fourth quarter than it did in the beginning of the first half of the year don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer and on the cost takeout side we did get a modest benefit in the fourth quarter just because some of them were implemented through the november time frame but it wasn t significant and the cadence is really as i mentioned earlier pretty equal across the year so it s roughly 60 million to 65 million per quarter jeff ansell executive vice president president maybe one other addition to what jim just highlighted is that we said for 18 that north america outpaced europe and global emerging markets that is also true for 19 and in that retail north american retail and north american commercial therefore will be accretive to the overall rates we just described so it s very consistent with 2018 operator thank you our next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst thanks guys i appreciate it i had a couple of questions first being on channel inventories across your core end markets and your customers was there any pull ahead risk particularly in slowing traffic and some of these customers that we re seeing any potential pull forward risk into the quarter from tariff related price increases in your core tools businesses don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t say we don t really know if anybody pulled anything ahead for tariff reasons so our customers don t necessarily tell us that they re doing those types of things i would say that the inventory levels did modestly increase as we exited the year versus the previous year end but frankly they re not significant it s not something that we view as a major concern as we go into the first quarter and the year jeff ansell executive vice president president maybe additionally the pos as we exited the holiday season continued to be quite strong so what don described was we did have a little bit of inventory build in the course of the quarter most of that was gone by the end of the year very very consistent with where we wanted to be at the end of the year and where we ended last year secondly in terms of pull forwards the retailers and so forth have gotten so sophisticated system driven that there s very little pull ahead these days when you announce pricing so that was not a big impact to the quarter operator thank you our next question comes from robert barry with buckingham your line is open robert barry buckingham research group analyst hey guys good morning thanks for being here just a couple of things one is a follow up on an earlier question on commodity did that headwind actually go up versus that 3q because i thought it was 100 million now you said i think you said 50 of 320 million and then on the tariffs is that now in the walk 100 million headwind i m just curious to the extent to which the change in the value of the renminbi might actually be able to help you offset that thanks don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the commodity number has gone up primarily because of just some accounting dynamics on how certain things get accounted for there s a number that s kind of hung up in inventory as we go into this year that will impact the numbers so it s up by 40 million to 50 million versus maybe what we were thinking in the middle of last year primarily because of that dynamic and the other thing is on the tariff side yes that number is correct incremental 100 million year over year operator thank you this concludes the question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to dennis lange for closing remarks dennis lange vice president of investor relations shannon thanks we d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call

international monetary fund imf yesterday announced a downward review of its growth forecast for nigeria s economy to 2 0 percent for 2019 citing decline in crude oil prices the imf made this announcement in its world economic outlook weo january update released yesterday projecting that global economic growth will weaken to 3 5 percent this year due to the negative impact of the trade war between united states and china thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe imf downgrades growth forecast for nigeria s economy to 2 imf the 2 0 percent forecast for nigeria in 2019 is three percentage points lower than the 2 3 percent forecast by imf in its world economic outlook october 2018 the fund also revised downward its 2020 growth forecast for nigeria to 2 2 percent the 2 0 percent growth forecast for 2019 is lower than the forecast released last week by some the nation s investment firms and banks last week fsdh merchant bank projected 2 48 percent economic growth for the country in 2019 while coronation merchant bank and afrinvest limited projected 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent growth respectively forecast for sub saharan africa and crude oil the imf also downgraded its growth forecast for sub saharan africa to 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 citing impact of softening oil prices on the economies nigeria and angola in sub saharan africa growth is expected to pick up from 2 9 percent in 2018 to 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 for both years the projection is 0 3 percentage point lower than last october s projection as softening oil prices have caused downward revisions for angola and nigeria the headline numbers for the region mask significant variation in performance with over one third of sub saharan economies expected to grow above 5 percent in 2019 20 read also brent crude rises 1 but set for first yearly drop since 2015 the imf equally revised downward its forecast for average crude oil price in 2019 to 60 per barrel citing fears of softening global demand crude oil prices have been volatile since august reflecting supply influences including us policy on iranian oil exports and more recently fears of softening global demand as of early january crude oil prices stood at around 55 a barrel and markets expected prices to remain broadly at that level over the next 4 5 years average oil prices are projected at just below 60 per barrel in 2019 and 2020 down from about 69 and 66 respectively in the last weo metals prices are expected to decrease 7 4 percent year over year in 2019 a deeper decline than anticipated last october and to remain roughly unchanged in 2020 price forecasts for most major agricultural commodities have been revised modestly downwards the imf said global economy to grow at 3 5 the imf projected 3 7 percent growth for the global economic in 2018 but said this growth will weaken to 3 5 percent this year before rising to 3 6 percent in 2020 explaining the factors for its forecast the imf said the global expansion has weakened global growth for 2018 is estimated at 3 7 percent as in the october 2018 world economic outlook weo forecast despite weaker performance in some economies notably europe and asia the global economy is projected to grow at 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 0 2 and 0 1 percentage point below last october s projections the global growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 had already been revised downward in the last weo partly because of the negative effects of tariff increases enacted in the united states and china earlier that year the further downward revision since october in part reflects carry over from softer momentum in the second half of 2018 including in germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand but also weakening financial market sentiment as well as a contraction in turkey now projected to be deeper than anticipated risks to global growth tilt to the downside an escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook financial conditions have already tightened since the fall a range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications especially given the high levels of public and private debt these potential triggers include a no deal withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and a greater than envisaged slowdown in china the baseline forecast incorporates the us tariffs announced through september 2018 and retaliatory measures for the united states these include tariffs on solar panels washing machines aluminium and steel announced in the first half of 2018 a 25 percent tariff on 50 billion worth of imports from china and a 10 percent tariff on an additional 200 billion of imports from china with the latter rising to 25 percent after the current 90 day truce ends on march 1 2019 for china the forecast incorporates tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on 60 billion of imports from the united states the main shared policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilizing an already slowing global economy across all economies measures to boost potential output growth enhance inclusiveness and strengthen fiscal and financial buffers in an environment of high debt burdens and tighter financial conditions are imperatives regional growth forecast the imf stated specifically growth in advanced economies is projected to slow from an estimated 2 3 percent in 2018 to 2 0 percent in 2019 and 1 7 percent in 2020 this estimated growth rate for 2018 and the projection for 2019 are 0 1 percentage point lower than in the october 2018 weo mostly due to downward revisions for the euro area growth in the euro area is set to moderate from 1 8 percent in 2018 to 1 6 percent in 2019 0 3 lower than projected last fall and 1 7 percent in 2020 growth rates have been marked down for many economies notably germany due to soft private consumption weak industrial production following the introduction of revised auto emission standards and subdued foreign demand italy due to weak domestic demand and higher borrowing costs as sovereign yields remain elevated and france due to the negative impact of street protests and industrial action there is substantial uncertainty around the baseline projection of about 1 5 percent growth in the united kingdom in 2019 20 the unchanged projection relative to the october 2018 weo reflects the offsetting negative effect of prolonged uncertainty about the brexit outcome and the positive impact from fiscal stimulus announced in the 2019 budget this baseline projection assumes that a brexit deal is reached in 2019 and that the uk transitions gradually to the new regime however as of mid january the shape that brexit will ultimately take remains highly uncertain the growth forecast for the united states also remains unchanged growth is expected to decline to 2 5 percent in 2019 and soften further to 1 8 percent in 2020 with the unwinding of fiscal stimulus and as the federal funds rate temporarily overshoots the neutral rate of interest nevertheless the projected pace of expansion is above the us economy s estimated potential growth rate in both years strong domestic demand growth will support rising imports and contribute to a widening of the us current account deficit japan s economy is set to grow by 1 1 percent in 2019 0 2 percentage point higher than in the october weo this revision mainly reflects additional fiscal support to the economy this year including measures to mitigate the effects of the planned consumption tax rate increase in october 2019 growth is projected to moderate to 0 5 percent in 2020 0 2 percentage point higher than in the october 2018 weo following the implementation of the mitigating measures

u s home sales tumbled to their lowest level in three years in december and house price increases slowed sharply suggesting a further loss of momentum in the housing market the weak report from the national association of realtors nar on tuesday was the latest indication of slowing economic growth a survey last friday showed consumer sentiment dropped in january to its lowest level since president donald trump was elected more than two years ago existing home sales were now the weakest since trump was elected said mufg chief economist chris rupkey signaling the initial confidence boost from the new ideas and new legislation is falling flat the nar said existing home sales declined 6 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 99 million units last month that was the lowest level since november 2015 economists polled by reuters had forecast existing home sales falling 1 0 percent to a rate of 5 25 million units in december existing home sales which make up about 90 percent of u s home sales plunged 10 3 percent from a year ago for all of 2018 sales fell 3 1 percent to 5 34 million units the weakest since 2015 the housing market has been stymied by higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages which have led to tight inventory and more expensive homes but there are glimmers of hope the 30 year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to a four month low with much of the moderation occurring in the second half of december and house price inflation is slowing the median existing house price increased 2 9 percent from a year ago to 253 600 in december that was the smallest increase since february 2012 wage growth topped 3 2 percent in december outpacing house price gains for the first time since february 2012 according to the nar while economists expect affordability to improve they also caution that changes to the tax code in december 2017 which limited deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes had reduced the appeal of homeownership stocks on wall street were trading lower amid fears of slowing global economic growth after the international monetary fund trimmed its outlook the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and u s treasury prices rose broad weakness a survey last week showed a rebound in homebuilders confidence in january amid hope that the moderation in mortgage rates will help the housing market continue to grow at a modest clip as we enter the new year a month long partial shutdown of the federal government which has delayed data from the commerce department is however obscuring the economic picture the shutdown started on dec 22 as trump demanded that congress give him 5 7 billion this year to help build a wall on the country s border with mexico it has affected the commerce department leading to the suspension of the publication of data compiled by its bureau of economic analysis and census bureau including new home sales housing starts and building permits data released before the shutdown had pointed to persistent weakness in the housing market with economists estimating that housing would again be a drag on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter residential construction has subtracted from gdp growth since the first quarter of 2018 economists estimate that the impasse over the border wall was cutting off at least two tenths of a percentage point from quarterly gdp growth a week the realtors group said the longest government shutdown in the country s history had so far not had an impact on home sales but warned this could change last month existing home sales fell in all four regions there were 1 55 million previously owned homes on the market in december down from 1 74 million in november but up from 1 46 million a year ago at december s sales pace it would take 3 7 months to exhaust the current inventory down from 3 9 in november and up from 3 2 a year ago a six to seven months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 46 days in december up from 42 days in november and 40 days a year ago thirty nine percent of homes sold in december were on the market for less than a month the share of first time buyers fell to 32 percent last month from 33 percent in november economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first time buyers is needed for a robust housing market going forward we expect softer home prices to support existing home sales but not by enough to offset the downtrend said roiana reid an economist at berenberg capital markets in new york the only sustainable and viable solution in our view is more construction especially of lower priced homes

this article is more than 5 years old getty images nomura securities has broken ranks from their investment bank competitors on china their hong kong based team thinks china s economy will get worse later this year stimulus does china no favors last week both barclays and morgan stanley analysts said that the second half would be better for china than the first the main reason was stimulus starting to set into the economy and the assumption that the 90 day trade truce would get expanded into the summer but on tuesday nomura securities analysts led by ting lu said the worst is yet to come for the chinese economy growth will get much worse in the first half despite beijing s increasingly aggressive easing and stimulus measures says ting they expect gdp growth to slow to sub 6 in the first half and for the full year to come in around 6 down from 6 6 in 2018 as reported on sunday see what s going on with china all of a sudden forbes 2019 bloomberg finance lp china is losing the trade war in nearly every way forbes if china s economy is in serious danger how can it offer trade concessions forbes nomura looks at weaker infrastructure spending and real estate as the guide xi jinping has stated numerous times that he does not want the stimulus to go towards unproductive sectors of the economy he has also come down on the real estate market preferring developers build properties for people who plan on living in them rather than speculating on them or treating them as savings accounts china analysts have a hard time fully trusting beijing s gdp numbers so they look elsewhere for evidence of economic health like energy consumption trending just under 2 per year there s also been a sharper than expected slowdown in the construction machinery sector which accounts for around 0 4 of the nation s gdp that slowdown is part of the synchronized demand shock nomura analysts sees coming in 2019 2019 bloomberg finance lp the government has basically ordered its state run banks to open its coffers and lend lend lend they are focused on the usual a build out of chinese infrastructure as demonstrated by over 1 trillion yuan 146 billion worth of rail and metro projects approved since late last year and another 1 39 trillion yuan quota approved for local government bond issuance to help finance it all these new rail projects should translate into higher construction equipment sales but that does not seem to be the case we have serious doubts says ting one reason is declining real estate investment another is xi s penchant to control debt unless xi takes his foot off the brakes the slowdown in the construction machinery sector could save another 0 2 percentage points off china s gdp this year markets have yet to fully recognize the worsening situation ting says gdp growth will eventually bottom out but markets don t appear to have factored in a sharp slowdown and may still be putting too much faith in the efficacy of government support 2019 bloomberg finance lp wall street believes beijing will further ramp up its stimulus measures and maybe even de peg the yuan from the dollar the yuan is not a fully free floating currency it is only allowed to depreciate by around 4 from its lows some china bears see the yuan finally breaking through seven to the dollar with super bears seeing it going to double digits if the people s bank of china stopped intervening in the forex market the pboc also recently said it would cap credit growth especially in the property sector some emerging market hedge fund investors believe xi will have to give in on real estate and allow more properties to be built regardless of demand from actual buyers who want to live there if xi signals he will relax controls on real estate the market will respond positively in the short term but long term the china debt story will rear its ugly head again and build the case for a hard landing if beijing miscalculates chinese equity markets closed weaker on tuesday as the international monetary fund s director christine lagarde rethinks global growth and washington calls for the extradition of huawei s cfo meng wanzhou from canada intellectual property remains the biggest sticking point in ongoing trade talks another headwind for china over the weekend xi said the country faced serious dangers politically and economically speaking 2019 bloomberg finance lp yes the overall gdp percentage growth was less than in years past as virtually every headline has reminded us says brendan ahern cio for kraneshares an alternative headline would be china s gdp exceeds 90 trillion yuan for the first time the majority of the data released exceeded expectations he says meanwhile on the trade front u s companies are likely done with tariff front loading meaning there will be a decline in china trade figures yet again over the coming months year over year comparisons will look worse also as china s monetary and fiscal stimulus hasn t yet worked into the system upcoming pmi data for january will provide further insights the latest gdp data show that annual growth in 2018 was 6 6 though many china watchers believe that true gdp is more

ceo jim loree jim loree chief executive officer ok thanks dennis and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us as you saw in today s release we delivered a respectable fourth quarter continuing our trajectory of above market organic growth and delivering strong eps growth and solid free cash flow dollars and conversion as many of you know in 2018 we faced an unusual and sudden onslaught of large and volatile external headwinds most of which developed during the course of the year specifically pressure from input cost inflation fx and tariffs had by fourth quarter grown from our initial january guidance of 150 million pre tax to 370 million which at the eps level would have been about 25 dilutive to prior year eps had we not managed to offset all but 50 million of that with additional price cost management and other actions the fact that we ended up delivering 9 adjusted eps growth in 2018 on 8 revenue growth which included 5 organic is quite remarkable it speaks volumes as to how agile experience agile our experienced management team deals with short term adversity and operating environment challenges while continuing to pursue above market growth and moving the company forward strategically more on that in a few minutes but first a few words about the fourth quarter revenues were up 5 to 3 6 billion with organic growth of 6 tools storage delivered 7 organic with strength in all major geographies and business units the tools growth was driven by the continued rollout of the craftsman brand price realization and leveraging our portfolio of growth catalysts industrial delivered 14 total revenue growth inclusive of the nelson fastener acquisition and organic was up 4 for industrial the oil gas business exceeded our plan this quarter and delivered a robust 27 organic growth derived from increased pipeline project activity in north america our total company adjusted operating margin rate was 13 3 as volume leverage price and cost actions were more than offset by the impact of currency commodity inflation and tariffs security was a bright spot this quarter delivering both operating margin dollar and rate improvement versus a year ago the security team is energized and focused and we are looking forward to realizing a significant and growing benefit from that business transformation as 2019 unfolds eps for the quarter was 2 11 in line with expectations and now i ll turn to full year highlights full year revenues were 14 0 billion up 8 including 5 organic growth and three points from acquisitions excluding charges diluted eps for the year was 8 15 a 9 increase versus 2017 and our operating margin rate remained solid at 13 6 despite absorbing the 370 million of headwinds previously mentioned turning to capital allocation we continued our balanced approach once again in 2018 during the year we repurchased 500 million of our shares and increased the dividend once again the 51st consecutive year of increases from an m a point of view we closed on nelson fasteners which further diversifies the engineered fastening business into industrial markets we also announced the ies attachments acquisition and our entry into large outdoor power equipment with mtd as our equity partner we re excited to see these opportunities progress and fuel future growth in the coming years in summary 2018 was a successful year one in which we cut through challenges to deliver solid results this performance is attributable to the agility passion and dedication of our workforce and i want to take this opportunity to thank every employee for their commitment and their resolve because it is our people to whom we attribute this great culture and the passion to perform well in any environment they live our purpose every day with incredible energy and commitment as we enter 2019 the external challenges don t magically disappear however we are well prepared and positioned to tackle them in addition there are signs that the global economic growth is slowing and that the u s economy may soon be coming to the end of one of the most enduring recoveries in u s history we are leaning into these challenges and will leverage our sfs 2 0 operating system while deploying an impressive array of growth and margin improvement initiatives to once again be successful in 2019 the investments we ve made to support organic growth and our recent acquisitions have created the strongest pipeline of revenue generating catalysts we ve ever had during my almost 20 years as a c level executive in this company these opportunities will provide a foundation for continued share gain and can act as a buffer to the revenue impact that could result from potentially slower markets we will see benefits in 2019 from the rollout of the craftsman brand the largest product program in our history as well as the repositioning of the stanley and the stanley fatmax brands in the north american home center channel with these programs we are unlocking new opportunities for share gain by aligning our brands across core user groups within the tradesman and professional segments while leveraging our brands fully with our retail partners the response we have seen from our customers and end users with the craftsman rollout encourages us regarding the potential for 2019 and beyond our core and breakthrough innovation initiatives are stronger than ever and our innovation focus permeates the entire company we expect to see future revenue benefits not only from flexvolt which is a well traveled story but also from new innovations coming to market in tools fastening and other industrial businesses as well as security in terms of the lenox irwin acquisitions we re attacking the revenue synergy opportunities which will represent 100 million to 150 million of organic growth over a multiyear period as we broaden the distribution of these products around the world in the emerging markets we continue to deliver outsized growth and share gain and we are leveraging our unique business model the strength of our brands including stanley branded midpoint mid price point corded and cordless power tools as well as hand tool products and we re having immense success growing at two to three times the market rate and across both developed and emerging markets e commerce remains a key revenue growth driver for us this year it represents a 1 billion high growth business a channel in which we are the industry leader across the globe by a wide margin and turning to our recent acquisitions in addition to the organic growth opportunities i mentioned with craftsman and lenox irwin we expect to generate inorganic growth from the ies acquisition in 2019 for which we are awaiting government approvals additionally as i said earlier our mtd partnership is just getting started and we are excited about the future benefits from this relationship as part of the deal we have secured an option to purchase the remaining 80 in 2021 and beyond for an amount which should approximate seven to eight times ebitda this provides clear visibility to almost 3 billion of instant growth in the early 2020s at what will truly be a great acquisition price based on the joint value creation efforts under way between the companies so with all these incredibly robust growth catalysts we are in an excellent position for a successful march to 22 billion of revenue by 2022 in fact we are so well positioned that we are now shifting our near term emphasis from identifying and acquiring new growth catalysts to first continuing to execute the ones that we already have and then second focusing on margin rate accretion for starters we will leverage our 250 million cost reduction program which is substantially complete as well as pricing and productivity benefits in 2019 beyond that we are now in the process of developing and executing an array of margin expansion initiatives many of which are aided by applying modern technology such as elements of industry 4 0 and advanced analytics more to come at our investor meeting in may but rest assured this will be a powerful and substantial initiative that will generate future margin accretion and buffer our earnings and cash flow from the vagaries of economic cycles and the external operating environment in addition we have redirected our capital allocation in the short term to a deleveraging posture keeping the balance sheet in a prudent place as is appropriate for this stage of the cycle this will give us maximum flexibility in the future for opportunistic repurchases and for acquisitions as our long term capital allocation strategy of 50 back to the shareholders and 50 reinvested in growth remains intact so in summary there s a lot to be excited about with this powerful growth story and now adding the additional focus on margin expansion will ensure that the benefit of all this revenue growth makes its way into even higher growth rates for operating margin and eps and now i ll turn it over to don allan who ll walk you through more detail in the segment performance overall financial results and 2019 guidance don don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone i will now take a deeper dive into our business segment results for the fourth quarter tools storage delivered 4 total revenue growth with 7 organic growth and a three point headwind from currency organic growth included five points of volume and two points from price we continue to see sequential improvement in our price realization which represented a full quarter benefit from the price actions we executed during the third quarter the operating margin rate for the segment was 15 4 down from the prior year as benefits of volume leverage pricing and cost control were more than offset by the impacts of currency commodity inflation and tariffs the impact of these headwinds amounted to 135 million for stanley black decker approximately 90 of this figure impacted tools storage in the fourth quarter the strong organic growth and related share gains were experienced across each tools storage region and sbu first on a geographic basis north america was up 10 organically with strong performances across all channels u s retail and u s commercial markets both posted low double digit growth and our industrial and auto repair markets generated mid single digit growth north america s growth continued to be fueled by new product innovations including flexvolt the craftsman brand rollout and price realization the craftsman rollout is continuing to be well received by end users and our customers for the year it drove close to two points of revenue for tools storage net cannibalization we are excited and encouraged by the success we are seeing as we continue the rollout in 2019 more on that from jeff a little bit later europe delivered 4 organic growth in the quarter nine out of 10 markets grew organically an impressive performance as we did see some weaker market conditions in europe the team once again leveraged our strong portfolio of brands and expanded our retail relationships to produce above market organic growth finally emerging markets delivered 3 organic growth diligent price actions to offset currency headwinds lenox irwin revenue synergies as well as a continued focus on e commerce and the ongoing mpp launch continued to support growth in this part of the tools storage business these actions were partially offset by severe market contractions that we saw in argentina and turkey these two markets reduced growth by approximately 360 basis points and that is not unexpected given the recent foreign exchange volatility we ve seen in those two countries however latin america continued to be strong with double digit growth brazil colombia ecuador chile and mexico had high single digit or double digit organic performances additionally in russia india korea and taiwan they all posted high single or double digit organic growth as well now taking a look at the tools storage sbus all lines showed high single digit growth in the quarter power tools equipment delivered 7 organic growth and benefited from new product introductions and strong commercial execution flexvolt delivered a robust mid teen growth for the year while delivering improved profitability which is now in line with the overall segment average hand tools accessories storage delivered 8 organic growth as new product introductions the continued craftsman rollout and then solid performances within the construction and industrial focused product lines and of course the contribution from lenox and irwin revenue synergies all these items contributing to their growth in summary an excellent quarter and a very successful year for the tools storage organization with growth in every region operating margin for the quarter was strong at 15 4 as the benefits from volume leverage pricing and cost control were more than offset by what we saw around the headwinds in currency commodity and tariffs this team continues to be resilient and is acting with agility to return this business back to margin expansion in 2019 turning to industrial this segment delivered 14 total revenue growth which included 12 points of growth from the nelson fastener acquisition and a negative two points from currency organic growth was 4 and operating margin rate declined year over year to 13 2 as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by commodity inflation the dilutive impact from the acquisition of nelson fasteners and then an unfavorable revenue mix within the fourth quarter engineered fastening posted total growth of 14 which included the contribution from nelson fasteners organic growth for engineered fastening was 1 due to higher system shipments and fastener penetration gains in the automotive business which were partially offset by a decline in global light vehicle production the latest global light vehicle production for full year 2018 shows a modest retraction versus the prior year as demonstrated this year our fastener business can still grow in this environment as we increase the fastener content within our customers for the year our auto fastener growth was 6 over 600 basis points ahead of global production the infrastructure businesses delivered robust growth up 18 organically this was primarily due to stronger north american oil gas pipeline projects which contributed an impressive 27 organic growth in the quarter we also had modest growth within our hydraulic tool business finally the security segment declined 1 with bolt on acquisitions contributing three points of growth which was offset by an organic decline of 2 and unfavorable currency of 2 north america declined 2 organically as higher volumes in automatic doors and healthcare were more than offset by lower installation revenues in commercial electronic security europe was down 2 organically as growth in sweden was offset by weakness in the u k and france in terms of profitability the segment operating margin expanded to 12 improving 100 basis points versus the prior year the security team continues to make progress on the transformation plan namely optimizing our cost to serve while positioning the business to provide new and differentiated offerings to our large key account customers and to our small to medium sized accounts this quarter and the second half demonstrated an important first step toward stabilizing the margin performance of this business by delivering operating margin dollars and rate improvement versus 2017 we expect these transformation initiatives to gain further traction in 2019 as we continue to position the business for meaningful margin dollar and rate expansion and more consistent organic revenue growth in summary it was another promising quarter for security with the team delivering year over year margin expansion for the first time since late 2016 let s take a look at our free cash flow performance on the next page i would like to highlight that we are presenting the 2017 cash flow amounts as previously reported and exclude the impacts of the new accounting standards that were adopted in january of 2018 we believe that presenting the cash flow results in this manner provides a more meaningful comparison of the company s operating cash flow performance similar to past years we were able to drive significant working capital improvements during the quarter our full year free cash flow performance was solid as we generated 769 million in 2018 cash from operations declined 158 million versus 2017 which was driven by higher tax payments due to the addition of the toll charge that was included within u s tax reform and we also had higher m a related payments we saw our capital expenditures increase by 49 million in 2018 as we made investments to expand our manufacturing and distribution capacity made technology investments to support functional transformation and industry 4 0 and invested to support our acquisition integrations this performance resulted in free cash flow as a percentage of net income of approximately 119 excluding the noncash net charges associated with u s tax reform free cash flow conversion was approximately 90 in line with expected expectations communicated in our october earnings call from a working capital turn perspective we delivered 8 8 turns in the fourth quarter a decrease of 0 3 turns versus the prior year this decline is primarily due to carrying higher levels of inventory to support the craftsman rollout and to a lesser extent the dilutive impact from the acquisition of nelson working capital management remains a key pillar of the sfs 2 0 operating system we continue to drive working capital improvements across the company with heavy focus on improving the performance of our recent acquisitions and eventually moderating the inventory levels from our tools brands transitions that are happening right now when we feel that s appropriate we are confident in our ability to bring our working capital turns back above 10 in the coming years now let s move deeper into our 2019 guidance we are targeting approximately 4 organic growth in 2019 with an adjusted earnings per share range of 8 45 to 8 65 up approximately 5 versus prior year at the midpoint the free cash flow conversion will be approximately 85 to 90 the free cash flow conversion is slightly below our historical performance and long term targets due primarily to two factors one we are expecting that much of the cash payments associated with our q4 2018 cost reduction program will occur in 2019 the second factor is the ongoing cash payment associated with the total charge that we ll see for the next seven years over the long term we are still confident that a conversion rate of approximately 100 is still achievable as we use our core sfs principles to drive working capital out of the system on a gaap basis we expect earnings per share to range from 7 45 to 7 65 which is inclusive of various onetime charges related to m a as well as some onetime cost related to our margin enhancement initiative that jim just discussed also including the ongoing security transformation turning to the drivers of core eps growth you can see on the left hand side of the chart we expect the benefits from organic volume to generate 0 30 to 0 40 of eps accretion the cost reduction program we executed at the end of 2018 is expected to deliver 1 05 of eps which is a net of a modest set of investments to support value driving activities such as industry 4 0 advanced analytics and our security transformation these items will be partially offset by 0 90 to 1 of incremental tariff commodity inflation and currency headwinds net of both carryover price benefits and new pricing actions implemented earlier this year in response to tariffs we expect a tax rate of approximately 17 5 which represents a 0 15 eps headwind year over year and then lastly the benefits from the mtd partnership and the lower share count partially offset by higher interest expense should deliver a positive 0 10 in eps i would highlight that we have included section 301 list 3 at a 10 assumption for the full year if this does increase to 25 it could represent a gross headwind of approximately 100 million before pricing and other mitigation efforts as you read in the release and heard from jim we are preparing to take additional cost and margin driving activities to insulate ourselves from this and other risks also as you know we always build a level of contingency to ensure that we can deliver our guidance and absorb a certain level of unknown market or external headwinds and we will continue to do that in 2019 i would now like to review one other miscellaneous guidance matter we expect the first quarter earnings to be approximately 13 of the full year performance this is about 400 basis points lower than last year the primary factor driving this lower percentage of full year delivery is that we continue to expect elevated levels of external headwinds particularly in tools which from a profile perspective are more heavily weighted toward the front half of the year this will cause the first quarter to show operating margin rate and dollar retraction as we have a headwind of approximately 125 million to 135 million net of pricing benefits which is nearly three quarters of the expected 170 million full year net headwind now turning to the segment outlook on the right side of the page organic growth within tools storage is expected to be at mid single digits in 2019 there are multiple catalysts supporting growth including core innovation continued benefits from flexvolt the lenox and irwin revenue synergies emerging market opportunities and the continued brand transitions with craftsman stanley and stanley fatmax margin rates are expected to be positive year over year we are expecting the external environment to continue to be challenging in 2019 presenting another year of large external headwinds as i just mentioned however we will continue to leverage multiple margin levers including price realization cost actions margin enhancing initiatives and volume to offset these headwinds and position the business for a return to margin expansion in 2019 with stronger performance expected for the second half in the industrial segment we expect a relatively flat organic performance reflecting softening conditions within the automotive end market we re expecting engineered fastening to be relatively flat organically with continued growth within automotive fasteners our systems outlook reflects a softer year as we have been seeing a more constrained capex spending environment with our auto customers in oil gas we are planning for low to mid single digit growth driven by stronger north american pipeline project activity and then hydraulic tools growth will be relatively flat due to slower market conditions in that space we expect operating margins to be flat year over year with productivity and cost actions offset by commodity inflation and tariffs in our industrial segment finally in the security segment we re expecting the organic growth to be up low single digits in 2019 as the team continues to execute its transformation strategy this should translate into improved operating margins year over year as we continue to stabilize margins and deliver on our initiatives to lower our cost to serve so in summary 4 organic growth 4 to 6 adjusted eps expansion despite a two point tax headwind a solid result and a balanced view that acknowledges the current market condition and today s view of the external headwinds which are front half loaded we believe we are taking the appropriate actions to position the company for success in 2019 despite a very dynamic operating environment we remain focused on our organic growth catalysts margin expansion initiatives strong free cash flow generation and successful acquisition integrations with that i will like to turn the call over to jeff jeff ansell executive vice president president thank you don i would like to provide a few more points on the tools storage performance for the year including updates on our strategic brand partnerships for craftsman and stanley we closed 2018 with high single digit organic growth enabled by record setting new product launches best in class commercial partnerships and integration excellence as evidence irwin lenox and waterloo have delivered double digit organic growth since becoming part of stanley black decker adding to the strong acquisitive performance is craftsman which is exceeding both our and our customers expectations we re on track to 1 billion in revenue growth by 2021 seven years ahead of schedule this progress is being driven by strong user acceptance as such we have achieved a 4 6 star rating across well over 1 000 products and outstanding in store execution by both lowes and ace we also announced last quarter that the home depot will now be the exclusive home improvement retailer for stanley and stanley fatmax hand tools storage product portfolios both in store and online beginning this year the product will begin to ship in the front half of 2019 now i ll turn the call back over to jim to wrap up today s presentation jim loree chief executive officer thank you jeff in summary 2018 was a year of solid performance despite the volatile external environment as we said we delivered 8 total revenue growth including 5 organic net om rate remained robust at 13 6 and adjusted eps grew by 9 our teams acted with speed and agility while facing into and overcoming an unprecedented impact from currency commodity and tariff headwinds and while these headwinds will gradually abate as 2019 unfolds they will be with us for a while and the economic growth backdrop also looks to be slowing as well so with that as context we are pleased that our 2019 outlook calls for 4 organic growth with a 4 to 6 eps expansion and we feel good about that we remain focused on delivering above market organic growth with operating leverage reenergizing our focus on margin expansion continuing to successfully execute our recent acquisitions and generating strong free cash flow and as always our seasoned leadership team will act with agility and leverage sfs 2 0 and all available avenues to maximize our value creation for shareholders in other news today we are announcing that stanley black decker was named to the carbon disclosure a list for both climate change and water this great recognition is an honor and it underscores our commitment to continue to conduct ourselves in a socially responsible manner i would like to thank my senior management team and all of our stanley black decker associates around the world as well as all our stakeholders including the investment community for your support we are looking forward to another successful year in 2019 and continuing our pursuit of strong financial performance pervasive innovation and social responsibility thank you and with that we are now ready for q a dennis questions and answers operator dennis lange vice president of investor relations great thanks jim shannon we can now open the call to q a please thank you operator thank you our first question comes from rich kwas with wells fargo securities your line is open rich kwas wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning jim don first on jim so focus on deleveraging here kind of base level for capital deployment doesn t seem like this is going to be a year of meaningful m a what would you characterize given where we are in the cycle of the puts and takes consideration in terms of additional m a and then don real quick on the free cash flow conversion and the over underlying conservatism in the guidance if you could make some comments on conservatism and then second on fcf is there any working capital headwind with regard to the transition of the stanley brand to home depot thanks jim loree chief executive officer ok it s jim i ll start at this point in the cycle our plan is to kind of go in strong stay strong and emerge stronger and that s exactly what we did in 08 09 if you recall those that followed us for a long time when we went into this the cycle we actually had our balance sheet in great shape and we continued to maintain as much operating margin and cash flows we could squeeze out of the company even though the revenues were down a little bit and in 09 at the tail end of all that chaos we actually negotiated the black decker transaction and transformed the company subsequently now i m not suggesting that we have any plans to do that such a transaction again but what i will say is that it s really amazing when you come out of the end of the cycle and look at all the opportunities that are out there large and small that derived from others who had not maintained themselves in the same manner during that downward part of the cycle so with that debt to ebitda right now is about 2 6 times and we are deleveraging this year we may do one or two very small emerging market transactions but that would be about it and i d say by the end of 19 we re going to be in really great shape from a balance sheet perspective we are already but even better shape and then we ll see where we go from there don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer so to your second question rich on free cash flow conversion for 2019 guidance i mentioned the two items that are resulting us being in 85 to 90 with one being the total charge and then the other being m a or restructuring related payments associated with the fourth quarter charge that we took of about 100 million so most of that cash outflow will happen in 2019 on the working capital front we don t actually see a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019 because we do have to continue to work through these brand transitions that we ve discussed throughout the last year related to craftsman but now also related to what s happening with stanley and stanley fatmax in the home depot and we have to make sure that we have the right level of inventory to meet the needs of our customers and we re not going to get overly aggressive in our supply chain until we work through those transitions so we re not counting on a dramatic improvement in working capital turns in 2019 but as i mentioned once we work through that we can regulate and moderate to the levels that are more historical for us and begin to work our way back to 10 turns over the next few years operator thank you our next question comes from tim wojs with baird your line is open tim wojs robert w baird co analyst yes hey guys good morning i have a quick two parter i guess first could you just talk about within the tools growth guidance what is embedded in there in terms of accretion from craftsman and the stanley hand tool changes and then secondly i was just the cadence of q1 margins being lower is the implication that tools margins be positive through the remainder of 2019 just want to clarify that don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so if you think about tools storage organic growth we said mid single digits so you interpret what that but it can range anywhere from 4 to 6 so it s probably leaning toward closer to the high end of that range within there we see craftsman performance net of cannibalization so when we talk craftsman net of cannibalization we re including the impacts of what s happening with stanley and stanley fatmax and porter cable coming out of lowe s we believe that impacts probably two to three points in 2019 and so that kind of gives you a gauge of where we think it is so it s relatively close to what we experienced in 2018 maybe a little bit better the second question was related to what was the second question dennis dennis lange vice president of investor relations first quarter margins don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer first quarter margins so yes what it does imply as we look at the second third and fourth quarter we would expect to start to see in the tools business margin rate and dollar expansion year over year so the first as i mentioned a significant amount of that net headwind of 170 million 125 million to 135 million is happening in the first quarter so that s a dramatic impact to the first quarter which makes sense given the timing of the headwinds last year operator thank you our next question comes from jeffrey sprague with vertical research partners your line is open jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone jim i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what the kind of other margin enhancement actions you are taking i assume those are above and beyond the q4 restructuring and then also just maybe as a follow on to that last question it would seem you would still expect actual adjusted eps to probably be down on a year over year basis in the second quarter is that correct jim loree chief executive officer you take the second part don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer ok yes yes it s not true jeff that we actually expect adjusted eps to grow because we do have a low tax rate again in the second quarter and we had one last year so that s it s a bit of a headwind but it s not a significant headwind and we do expect om dollars to grow year over year jim loree chief executive officer ok and on the margin enhancements i ll give you a little appetizer i think the main course we ll serve up at the analyst meeting but essentially we ve as soon as we completed the work in the fourth quarter on the cost takeout the near term cost takeout we said to ourselves our margins are under attack from these headwinds we need to get back what we ve lost already so that 250 million will help but what if we get more of the same what if we the down what if we go into a downturn in back half of 19 or in 20 and so we said we really need to basically create some protection for call them black swans or economic cyclical aspects and also our objective here is to grow our operating margins by 50 basis points a year obviously that didn t happen in 2018 and we re committed to do that so we need a way to get there and we thought about this and we said 22 22 we re two years in we ve done enough deals now and they re every one of them is a deal that we d do over again if we could we love these deals we ve done enough so that we can actually see our way pretty much to 22 22 from a revenue point of view now let s figure out how we can make sure that we get the margin to go with it to create operating leverage so that we really get that double benefit of lots of revenue growth and margin expansion at the same time and so we ve been working a lot on different elements of digital technology and how that can be used to create value in our company both from a value proposition point of view in our products in our business models but also in our functional processes and so on and it really occurred to us that if we could accelerate many of these things that we re working on and put some serious accelerated focus on them that we started adding up the benefits from these various initiatives like industry 4 0 advanced analytics procurement 2 0 and indirect cost management the technologies that exist today to use analytics to really do those in a manage those various topics in a much more efficient manner is really compelling and so we ve been experimenting with some of that and we feel confident now that we have something that can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit over a two to three year period and we ll figure out what the exact amount is and we ll share that with you in may but it s a very large number and it s a very focused initiative we re going to run it like an acquisition integration with governance and like i said earlier we re going to focus on executing the growth initiatives that we already have and we re going to focus on margin expansion and i think the combination of those two things is going to be incredibly powerful operator thank you our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays your line is open julian mitchell barclays investment bank analyst hi good morning maybe just a quick update on what the sort of delta is in your earnings guidance versus previously the commentary around high single digit growth is it simply about a point or so less volume growth assumption or has anything changed in terms of your confidence around pricing initiatives particularly in tools don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say that there s certainly a point difference in growth as you mentioned versus just looking at the markets as they play out in the fourth quarter and the view of u s housing and the automotive space for production just feels like there s still growth there but it s slowing so that s certainly one factor we do have a little bit bigger tax headwind as well because we did come in lower for 2018 so that s a little bit of a headwind in addition and then the third thing is we need to continue to monitor the impact of all the price in the markets and like we said in october we re putting a fair amount of price actions into the market we re going to manage this both looking at what s the right thing to do for price and what s the right action to ensure we have the right level of volume and we re going to manage those in concert with each other to achieve the right outcomes so as we continue to do that there will be a little bit of pressure probably in the margin rate versus previous expectations and we saw that play out in the fourth quarter but those are really the three main factors operator thank you our next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan your line is open michael rehaut j p morgan analyst hi thanks good morning just a little bit more detail if possible around some of the moving pieces of 19 guidance and obviously appreciate all the help so far first on the margin i m sorry quarterly cadence with the biggest hit of the commodity inflation being in the first quarter are we to understand that the reason you have the confidence that you ll switch to operating margin positive in the remaining quarters is because of the cost actions that have already been put in place or is there some amount of price realization as well that you re still expecting and secondly also on the deleveraging how are we to think of share buyback for 19 when you talk about the benefit that you expect from lower shares is that just the flow through from what you ve done in 18 or is there anything incremental in 19 don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so the cadence of the quarter is clearly the biggest impact in the second quarter is going to be the headwinds going down dramatically year over year as we begin to annualize those headwinds in the second quarter if you remember in 2018 we certainly vividly remember the timing of all this but as we went into march and april we began to see commodity prices increase we got into may and we saw fx shift dramatically and in then june we saw tariffs come onto the scene so in the second quarter we saw significant ramp up of the headwinds and that continued into the third quarter so as we get to the end of the second quarter and into july we will have comped a lot of those headwinds and so you look at that aspect and then you look at the impact of the cost reductions which the impact is relatively even across the four quarters and so it s about 60 million per year per quarter i m sorry and therefore you got that impact combined with a lower level of headwinds year over year because of that comp issue is really why we believe we can grow our operating margin in the second quarter jim loree chief executive officer and also the fact that the pricing actions are kind of accumulating over time and getting bigger every quarter sequentially and so that has a benefit too especially as we get into second quarter of 2019 operator thank you our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research your line is open nigel coe wolfe research analyst thanks good morning guys just want to just unpackage your outlook for 4 to 6 so let s call it 5 tools storage growth in 19 roughly how does that shake out between north america europe rest of the world and what would your estimate be for market growth in north america in 19 jeff ansell executive vice president president i think the actual range don provided was probably 4 to 6 said it was probably going to be a little bit on the more toward the high side of that so i think that s what we re looking at for the over the course of 19 and i think you ll see that we re absolutely committed to growth in all markets so you look at growth we ll have growth in north america we ll have growth in europe we ll have growth in the global emerging markets consistent with what we had this year of those three probably the leading growth contender will be north america as it was in 18 but we re getting growth in both of those other places as well and we think with that estimate we ll grow above the market therefore representing market share gain again in 2019 consistent with what we had in 18 jim loree chief executive officer yes and i think we all know that the european economy had slowed quite a bit germany went negative the u k is in chaos and confusion with brexit italy is a disaster and despite all that our european outlook for tools is going to decent it ll be probably 2 to 4 kind of growth so it s still continuing to forge ahead in europe and then emerging markets we have some specific markets that are challenged right now as almost as we almost always do i think in this case turkey is tough argentina is really difficult and we had major currency devaluations in those markets but also just the economies themselves are really difficult so we might see a little bit slower growth in emerging markets this year than we did last year but still we re going to be significantly positive and we ll be running at least three times higher than the overall market growth operator thank you our next question comes from susan maklari with credit suisse your line is open susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning i just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you re thinking in terms of some of the commodity inputs we ve seen some of those pull back in the later parts of 2018 what s embedded in the forecast from that perspective for 2019 don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i talked about net headwinds of 170 million if you break that down a little bit the gross headwind is about 320 million and you have an offsetting price impact of 150 million of that 320 million approximately half of that is commodity inflation so it s a significant number we have seen positive trends around certain commodities for sure but we do have to remember that a lot of the commodities that we get are really engineering grade commodities and we haven t seen as much of a movement in those commodities versus some other more straightforward commodities in steel in particular so we ve seen a little bit of benefit since december and as we continue to look at this it may continue to trend in the right direction and it could result in an opportunity for us as the year goes on but at this stage we actually have not seen a dramatic movement in the commodities that we buy because we tend to buy at the higher end of the grades and as a result that hasn t moved as much as some of the other commodities but the trends are positive which we feel good about right now operator thank you our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley your line is open josh pokrzywinski morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys just a question on the bridge i know that there s kind of a lot of moving parts here and maybe with the outstanding numbers from 3q could use a little bit of an update i guess the real delta here would seem that a normal organic growth if the right number is kind of a 20 incremental margin you guys seem to be closer to 10 and there looks like there s been at least on the surface some slippage in that 250 million of cost reduction and a lot of that soaks up the relief that you ve gotten on tariffs or baking in list three at 10 is that kind of the rough math of it because i guess both of those numbers both the headwind and the tailwind seemed a little bit lower than what i would have thought on the surface just to start out don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think on the leverage front you probably have to really look at it on a volume basis versus total organic so if you look at volume you can use an assumption like 20 25 that kind of gets you to the numbers that we re talking about and then there s a separate price benefit that s netted in the headwinds that we ve laid out for guidance and for actual results because we really dissected that because pricing can kind of mute the leverage numbers or change the leverage numbers quite a bit and as a result you re better off looking at them in those separate categories operator thank you our next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning guys so i guess just a couple one is kind of a box ticking item on the margin enhancement initiatives could that possibly give upside to second half with respect to payback or is that more of a 2020 payback and then if you could just talk about the impact of what s going on at sears on your craftsman rollout expectations jim loree chief executive officer ok well it s jim i ll have jeff handle the second question and on the margin enhancement initiative the benefit that we re going to see from that is going to be recognized over a two to three year period we re going to do everything we can we re going to work really hard to try to bring some benefit into 2019 as an insurance policy and it s not clear that it s going to be a huge number but i think it s there s probably something there and we ll go after it jeff ansell executive vice president president regarding the question relative to sears i think it s really based on everything that has just occurred in the last two weeks you d say it s very much business as usual if you look at the trend over the last at least 36 months that company would typically announce a closure plan following holiday sales and that would be updated over the course of the year to include more and more stores this year it s not much different so the fact that those stores will remain in operation at a lower count than the prior year etc is very consistent with what s happened in the prior years so we expect that our craftsman rollout will continue to take share as that presence atrophies in the marketplace so not that different than any other prior year operator thank you our next question comes from michael wood with nomura instinet your line is open michael wood nomura securities analyst hi good morning if we take into account craftsman accretion to growth and what where we think you re running at for price it seems like there s not much organic growth outside of craftsman in tools storage volumes you seem to be tracking well above that currently so i m curious what is explaining the deceleration in that lack in the business ex craftsman and does that concern you jim loree chief executive officer well i think that we try to make it very clear that the economic backdrop is one of slowing growth it s nothing to do with our market share our market share continues to outperform the market and i think the reality is setting in hopefully not just us but most industrial companies are facing slower economic growth in the united states in china in pretty much most parts of europe and the emerging markets i mean essentially the whole world except for a few bright spots like india for example but the reality is that economic growth that we see for 2019 and is pretty is probably a good point lower than it has been in the recent couple of years and then on top of that it s no secret that the construction markets in the united states have slowed as well so baked into our guidance is a reality check on the slowing markets it s not catastrophic it s nothing that we can t handle but our long term growth objectives are 4 to 6 we re putting 4 out there at a time when economic growth is slowing makes perfect sense to me don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and at the end of the day we think that s the right thing to do for all the reasons that jim articulated but any chance we re wrong the markets are a little better then we ll all be happy but this is the right approach given the signals that we ve seen in housing the signals that we ve seen in the automotive production space they re all showing growth for the most part except for auto production looks like it s going to be down next year but they re slowing and we have to be realistic about what the trends are right now jeff ansell executive vice president president maybe one last addition would be if you look at 2018 our growth was 6 to 7 in tools in a market that grew slower than that that market we think is going to be compressed by about a point this coming year and our growth looks pretty similar to that 5 to 6 so our growth rates will still be accretive to market growth although the market s growing just a little bit slower that s kind of it operator thank you our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs your line is open joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone just maybe following up on that a little bit jim and the slowing that you saw that you re expecting to see in the u s i mean tools storage still put up 10 organic in north america and so can you talk about whether you started to see slowing in 4q as the quarter progressed and then i guess my second question for don in talking through that 250 million cost benefit number did you recognize any of that in 2018 and what s the cadence of that number as we progress through 2019 jim loree chief executive officer ok i ll take the first part the slowing in the tools market i think started in the third quarter concurrent with the interest rates increases that were being implemented by the fed and we saw the same thing in automotive as well the interest rate sensitive type markets housing automotive impacted by rising interest rates and it continued in the fourth quarter we were thinking well maybe it s an anomaly in the third quarter sometimes you get those for a couple of months or a couple yes a couple of months and it really did continue into the fourth quarter pretty steady in the sense that it didn t get worse it s just kind of felt a little bit more anemic in the third quarter and fourth quarter than it did in the beginning of the first half of the year don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer and on the cost takeout side we did get a modest benefit in the fourth quarter just because some of them were implemented through the november time frame but it wasn t significant and the cadence is really as i mentioned earlier pretty equal across the year so it s roughly 60 million to 65 million per quarter jeff ansell executive vice president president maybe one other addition to what jim just highlighted is that we said for 18 that north america outpaced europe and global emerging markets that is also true for 19 and in that retail north american retail and north american commercial therefore will be accretive to the overall rates we just described so it s very consistent with 2018 operator thank you our next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst thanks guys i appreciate it i had a couple of questions first being on channel inventories across your core end markets and your customers was there any pull ahead risk particularly in slowing traffic and some of these customers that we re seeing any potential pull forward risk into the quarter from tariff related price increases in your core tools businesses don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t say we don t really know if anybody pulled anything ahead for tariff reasons so our customers don t necessarily tell us that they re doing those types of things i would say that the inventory levels did modestly increase as we exited the year versus the previous year end but frankly they re not significant it s not something that we view as a major concern as we go into the first quarter and the year jeff ansell executive vice president president maybe additionally the pos as we exited the holiday season continued to be quite strong so what don described was we did have a little bit of inventory build in the course of the quarter most of that was gone by the end of the year very very consistent with where we wanted to be at the end of the year and where we ended last year secondly in terms of pull forwards the retailers and so forth have gotten so sophisticated system driven that there s very little pull ahead these days when you announce pricing so that was not a big impact to the quarter operator thank you our next question comes from robert barry with buckingham your line is open robert barry buckingham research group analyst hey guys good morning thanks for being here just a couple of things one is a follow up on an earlier question on commodity did that headwind actually go up versus that 3q because i thought it was 100 million now you said i think you said 50 of 320 million and then on the tariffs is that now in the walk 100 million headwind i m just curious to the extent to which the change in the value of the renminbi might actually be able to help you offset that thanks don allan executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the commodity number has gone up primarily because of just some accounting dynamics on how certain things get accounted for there s a number that s kind of hung up in inventory as we go into this year that will impact the numbers so it s up by 40 million to 50 million versus maybe what we were thinking in the middle of last year primarily because of that dynamic and the other thing is on the tariff side yes that number is correct incremental 100 million year over year operator thank you this concludes the question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to dennis lange for closing remarks dennis lange vice president of investor relations shannon thanks we d like to thank everyone again for calling in this morning and for your participation on the call

the global economic engine is sputtering the international monetary fund imf cut its forecast for global gdp growth in 2019 the three big drivers of the world economy the united states china and europe are all showing signs of weakness if they fall observers fear global gdp falls with them the thing is repairing the world s economic engine will require doing something that might seem totally

delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up recent headlines have focused on distinct crises as the big threats to global growth think of president trump s trade war or brexit these ongoing events certainly aren t helping but they re also just flesh wounds masking a deeper injury the world does not look like an otherwise healthy economy hit by an idiosyncratic shock the editors of the financial times recently wrote rather it looks like an economy deficient in demand that s the thing about the nations running both budget surpluses and trade surpluses the twin surplus countries as the council of foreign relations brad setser calls them running a budget surplus literally means you re reducing demand in your economy taxing more than you re spending meanwhile running a trade surplus means you re producing more than you re consuming and relying on demand from other countries to make up the difference combine the two and the twin surplus countries aren t just sucking demand out of their own economies they re sucking demand out of the rest of the world as well germany is the most prominent and important offender here but others include south korea sweden switzerland and the netherlands china is a bit of a wild card they re running a big trade surplus but also a fiscal deficit we ll get back to them in a minute fortunately as a matter of policy the solution here should be pretty straightforward these are all advanced economies with large welfare states and sophisticated macro economic policymaking apparatuses they need to spend more and tax less as setser points out this spending should focus on social insurance retirement security and pensions health care cash aid to families and the poor and the like the kind of stuff that will drive up consumption by the largest share of the population tax cuts should have the same focus and a healthy dose of new infrastructure investments and public works programs would help as well all those policy changes will start adding demand to these countries rather than taking it away and by running their economies hot they ll drive up their imports and increase the value of their currencies smoothing out their trade balances of course this will mean buildups in national debt but south korea switzerland and sweden control their own national currencies in which they d be doing all this spending and borrowing under those conditions national debt loads are relatively harmless germany and the netherlands are in a trickier position since they re part of the euro currency union which is controlled by the ultra hawkish european central bank but most everyone agrees eurozone policies largely answer to german leadership they could get themselves the fiscal and monetary wiggle room if they wanted now about china its situation is more nuanced china may be piggy backing off other countries demand particularly the united states with its trade surpluses but it s also running budget deficits and thus adding to its domestic demand there are certainly different currency policy reforms china could undertake to close its trade imbalance but china is still an up and coming economy in terms of living standards with different forces pushing the value of the yuan in all directions even under ideal circumstances it s not clear china would be running trade deficits it s just that china is so huge that it still imports a ton regardless the world needs as much demand from china as it can get unfortunately the chinese economy is slowing too the imf s solution is for china to rein in its national borrowing and tighten credit conditions within the country but this would drag down aggregate demand and widen its trade surpluses further the imf ignores the fact that china s banks are mostly owned and backstopped by the national government which again controls the domestic chinese currency excessive lending by the chinese banking system isn t going to create a financial crisis the way it could in a market based system like america s so how should china respond as setzer notes beijing could do more on the social insurance front too a lot of china s economic stimulus is done through credit and lending to big companies meanwhile its citizens save a ton the government could get a lot of economic bang for its buck by giving chinese consumers more spending money through various government aid programs as for america we re certainly helping out the rest of the world with our big trade deficits but we also need more demand that will require reforming or re staffing the federal reserve to push it in a more dovish direction on interest rates in terms of fiscal policy anything from a big public infrastructure investment to medicare for all would certainly get demand back on track unfortunately that will probably require massive democratic victories in the next few elections which gets at a key point there s no hard economic reality forcing the economic powerhouses of the world to do what they do their mistakes are political choices based on the blinkered ideological conviction that budget surpluses and trade surpluses are responsible in truth the former can wreck your economy and when combined with the latter they can drag the rest of the world down with you

simply forgot he was talking to sentient beings at that moment in his mind he must still have been retweeting the latest happy talk lines from the prime minister s office canada is a relatively small relatively open economy that is dependent on exports and stable financial markets difficult times for the global economy are always problematic for canada s economy the united kingdom isn t the united states and brexit isn t the u s china trade war but a turbulent divorce between london and brussels will hurt europe and that would be felt most everywhere it s silly to pretend otherwise and voters should feel insulted that the federal government appears to think that we can t handle the truth anyway back to the outbreak of recession talk a downturn is by no means the mainstream view the international monetary fund on jan 21 shaved its outlook for canadian economic growth in 2019 to 1 9 per cent from the previous estimate of two per cent the bank of canada sees an expansion of 1 7 per cent both outlooks are decent if slower than the past couple of years for the canadian economy it s going to be fine pierre cléroux chief economist at business development bank of canada told me in an interview on jan 21 alberta will struggle this year because of the crisis in the oil patch but for the rest of the country the economy continues to perform well said cléroux advertisement 4 story

ontario premier said on jan 21 that the risk that the carbon tax could cause an economic downturn is very very real that s nonsense as the few billions of dollars that the government might collect

bloomberg reported that denver based crescat is shorting bank stocks because the big six will be the ones to suffer from what is likely to be a major economic recession brought on by a housing bust according to tavi costa an analyst at the firm the big six will be the ones to suffer from what is likely to be a major economic recession brought on by a housing bust tavi costa crescat analyst maybe the problem with that hypothesis is it forgets that canada s banks are too big to fail under no circumstance would ottawa allow any of the largest lenders to get near the brink much of the housing debt is backed by the government anyway and the banks must now keep plenty of cash on hand to act as a cushion during a financial crisis odds of a calamity are low advertisement 5 story continues

which gets to mylonas s outlook the bca analyst told bloomberg that canadian households are carrying too much debt to power through higher interest rates we re now at the point where the bank of canada is going to be flirting with triggering the next recession if it hasn t already mylonas said for sure all that debt has left canada vulnerable just how vulnerable depends on your outlook for interest rates mylonas and others who share his view are convinced that the bank of canada will trigger a consumption led recession by raising interest rates too high yet poloz the former bca analyst

this article first appeared in forum the edge malaysia weekly on january 21 2019 january 27 2019 in light of the uncertainty caused by the us china trade war the imf expects economic growth in the us to slow from a three year high of 2 9 in 2018 to 2 5 in 2019 while china s expansion has already slowed in recent years albeit from much higher levels us president donald trump and the previous gop controlled us congress claimed to be breathing new life into the us economy with generous tax cuts the us economy is now overheating with inflation rising above target causing the federal reserve to continue raising the federal funds rate to dampen demand as most families hardly gained from the tax changes us purchases of houses and consumer durables continued to decline through 2018 instead of investing in expanding productive capacity us companies spent much of their tax savings on a us 1 1 trillion stock buyback spree in 2018 hence the positive impacts of tax cuts were not only modest but are also diminishing nearly half of 226 us chief financial officers recently surveyed believe that the us will go into recession by the end of 2019 with 82 believing that it will have begun by the end of 2020 wall street s biggest banks jp morgan and bank of america are also preparing for a slowdown in 2019 as if to confirm their concerns both the dow jones industrial average and the s p 500 had their worst ever december performance since 1931 when stocks were battered after the great crash meanwhile the european central bank is expecting sluggish 1 7 regional growth in 2019 europe is close to recession with the fall of industrial output in germany france the uk and italy germany s industrial output fell by 1 9 month on month in november 2018 and was in negative territory in five of the

september italy europe s third largest economy recorded negative growth in the third quarter of 2018 as gdp fell by 0 1 in july september 2018 with weaker domestic demand as the uk remains mired in

negligible not preparing for the inevitable david lipton the first deputy managing director of the imf warned in early january 2019 the next recession is somewhere over the horizon and we are less prepared to deal with that than we should be less prepared than in the last although the imf had projected 3 7 global economic growth for 2019 in october 2018 lipton s statement suggests that the imf is likely to revise its 2019 growth forecast downward there have also been growing concerns over the continued efficacy of unconventional monetary policy since the 2008 2009 global financial crisis gfc undoubtedly countries now have less fiscal space than in 2009 and overall borrowing including public debt has risen since reaping what you sow the policy blunders since the gfc have only made things much worse the ideologically driven case for fiscal consolidation did not boost investor confidence for a robust recovery as promised despite acknowledging false claims cited to justify fiscal consolidation including the imf s admission that its early advice was based on faulty calculations there was no recommended change in policy course instead all responsibility for recovery was put on the monetary authorities which resorted to unconventional policies especially quantitative easing qe however the global economic recovery since then has remained tepid and easily reversible additional liquidity made available by qe has largely been used to buy financial assets and for speculation amplifying the financial vulnerability of emerging market economies which have experienced increased volatility governments also failed to take advantage of historically low even negative real interest rates to borrow and invest to boost productive capacity in the longer term by mainly benefiting financial asset holders qe has exacerbated wealth concentration meanwhile cuts in public services and social spending have worsened social polarisation as tax cuts for the rich have failed to generate promised additional investments and jobs growth the failure to achieve a robust recovery has not only worsened the debt situation but also made lives harder for ordinary people growing polarisation has also worsened resentment eroding trust and undermining solidarity and progressive alternatives ethno populist jingoism undermines cooperation but lack of preparedness can hardly be due to ignorance as there have been many such predictions recently certainly more than in 2007 2008 before the gfc the cooperation that enabled coordinated actions to prevent the great recession from becoming a depression has not only waned but major countries are now at loggerheads preventing collective action national political environments are also more hostile in europe the rise of ethno populist nationalism is making it harder to pursue eu level policies and to act together to prevent and mitigate the next financial crisis and downturn the new sovereigntists and false prophets of american exceptionalism are undermining multilateral cooperation when needed most thus a recession in 2019 may well elevate geopolitical tensions exacerbating the negative feedback loop for a perfect

one day after the biggest s p drop in a month stocks have regained their composure putting trade and global growth concerns on the backburner and global stock indices are generally a sea of green this morning trading was initially choppy overnight as hopes of more stimulus measures from china to shore up economic growth clashed with worries over progress between washington and beijing to resolve a trade spat between the world s top two economies the msci world equity index was down 0 1 percent with asian equity markets choppy as the region attempted to shrug off the headwinds from the us where stocks slumped on tuesday as the risk averse tone and lingering global growth concerns caught up with the major us indices on return from their extended weekend the ft reported that the us turned down china s offer for preparatory trade talks which was later denied by nec director larry kudlow helping u s equities pare some losses though the fresh concerns about u s china relations kept share prices in check early trade jitters pushed the msci index of asia pacific shares ex japan lower by 0 2 stalling after climbing to a seven week high on monday the main culprit for the risk off tone this morning is the change in sentiment around u s china trade talks that seeped into asia overnight and europe this morning said edward park deputy chief investment officer at brooks macdonald australia s asx 200 0 3 was subdued with underperformance in the energy sector after crude prices slipped by over 2 and nikkei 225 0 1 was dampened by disappointing trade data including the sharpest

impact of trade wars and populist rhetoric from politicians were all keeping markets on edge all these issues have an impact on markets every time you have an increase in rhetoric markets react it

kept monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with nirp held at 0 1 and 10yr jgb yield target at around 0 furthermore the boj extended its lending scheme for 1 year and stated that economic momentum for reaching price goal is sustained but lacking strength while it added that risks to price and economic outlooks are skewed to the downside boj reduced real gdp forecasts for fy18 but raised real gdp forecasts for fy19 and fy20 while it reduced core cpi forecasts on all years through to fy20 boj governor kuroda said the downward revision to price outlook is due to the temporary

lots of canada goose jackets if you catch up with events on the telly over the rest of this week i looked at buying one before i came out so as to fit in with the davos set when i saw how much they cost i realised i would rather not fit in actually i got there late last night and the only non restaurant places i found to eat were a kebab shop and a co op supermarket i was wondering whether bono has ever had a similar dilemma between the two choices as i m staying in a self catering apartment and after much deliberation i opted for the latter and cooked myself a pizza in nearly a quarter of a century it s probably the first business trip that i ve cooked for myself i quite enjoyed it anyway if you re in town let me know especially if you want to attend one of my sessions the cold air has obviously also infiltrated markets this week us bourses reopening yesterday failed to stem the reversal of some of the new year optimism indeed the latest headlines on the earnings and trade fronts weighed on sentiment equity markets failed to recover from heavy falls at the open with the s p 500 dow and nasdaq closing down 1 42 1 22 and 1 91 respectively the nyfang index dropped 3 38 as amazon and netflix posted their worst days of the year markets took another leg lower in the us afternoon session after headlines broke that us negotiators declined a proposed meeting between with mid level chinese officials apparently citing lack of progress on china s industrial policies especially the alleged forced technology transfers the meeting would have been with vice minister of commerce wang and vice minister of finance liao to lay groundwork for next week s planned meeting between senior officials namely vice premier liu us trade representative lighthizer and treasury secretary mnuchin those talks are still scheduled to take place but expectations for a breakthrough have now fallen late in the day trump administration officials formally denied the reports however head of the national economic council kudlow did add that enforcement is absolutely crucial to the success of these talks in any case the damage to markets had been done earnings also played a part in the sogginess as poor results from halliburton johnson johnson and stanley black decker weighed on the industrials and consumer discretionary sectors down 2 07 and 1 79 respectively all three companies declined following their latest quarterly reports with the common denominator being management comments about a challenging outlook ahead highlighted by black decker ceo loree saying economic growth is slowing this more than offset gains to ebay 6 13 which rallied after one of its bigger shareholders elliot management proposed a five step plan which in their view could result in ebay s share price almost doubling the energy sector also suffered 2 20 as wti oil tumbled 1 91 however did at least pare a sharper slide earlier in the session that move came despite there not really being an obvious catalyst aside from the various growth concerns which have been highlighted in recent days none of which are particularly new news meanwhile here in europe ubs also missed at both the earnings and sales lines following its quarterly report which resulted in shares falling 3 17 in switzerland albeit off the early lows that weighed on the wider european banks index which closed down 1 03 and for the fifth time in the last seven sessions while the stoxx 600 ended 0 36 hy credit spreads widened 4bps and 12bps in europe and the us respectively in contrast bonds were slightly stronger albeit only modestly so with bunds ending 2 0bps lower and treasuries 4 5bps the 2s10s curve also flattened 1 6 bps but the reality is that it still remains rooted in the 10 20bp range that it s been in since the end of november overnight the focus has turned to the boj where as expected there have been no changes to policy also as expected are the lower inflation forecasts in the boj s outlook the fourth consecutive quarter they have done so for the fiscal year starting april core cpi is expected to be 0 9 compared to 1 4 previously with the backdrop of lower inflation and with the consumption tax looming the hurdle to the boj contemplating adjusting policy continues to look high jgbs are slightly weaker this morning post the decision with the 10y up less than a basis point to 0 004 with kuroda due to speak shortly the yen has weakened 0 25 while the nikkei 0 04 is broadly flat that s the case also for the hang seng 0 06 and shanghai comp 0 07 with the kospi 0 24 outperforming the good news is that the slide for us equity futures also appears to have come to an end with s p 500 contracts up 0 15 that may reflect the news that lawmakers in the senate have agreed to hold separate votes today on rival proposals in order to reopen the government moving on there was some interest in the ecb s bank lending survey yesterday which was softer compared to recent surveys the net percentage of banks reporting tightening standards to enterprises was closer to even with 1 in q4 compared to 6 in q3 demand for loans also continued its slowing trend from recent quarters with the net balance to enterprises falling to 9 versus 12 in q3 it was a similar story for housing loans although demand for the latter did pick up at a country level the softness was mostly reserved for italy and spain notably the outlook for q1 also implies further moderation which fits in with lower growth expectations for the euro area this year at a minimum the data should add to the anticipation levels for tomorrow s pmis and ecb policy meeting our economists preview for the meeting is available here they don t think any big policy changes are imminent but think the council could shift its characterisation of the balance of risks to the downside apart from that they ll focus on any hints regarding new tltros and or any discussion of a potential one off deposit rate hike here in the uk it was nice to get some rare positive news in the form of the latest labour report indeed there were positive surprises for the november unemployment rate down one tenth to 4 0 vs 4 1 expected average weekly earnings up one tenth to 3 4 3m yoy vs 3 3 expected and employment change 141k 3m 3m vs 87k expected prints that of course compares to what have been weaker pmis in the uk recently and the ongoing brexit saga so this somewhat complicates the picture for the boe with the supply side narrative of a tighter uk labor market very much intact a hike by august is less than 50 priced however it will challenge the boe not to sound overly dovish given the strength in the hard data the only other data worth flagging yesterday in europe was the january zew survey in germany where there was a big slump in the current situations component to 27 6 vs 43 0 expected compared to 45 3 in december however the expectations component did climb 2 5pts to 15 0 and bettered expectations for a fall to 18 5 in the us monthly existing home sales fell short of expectations rising by 4 99 million in december compared to expectations for 5 25 million the slowest pace and biggest downside miss since november 2015 mortgage applications have picked up over the last couple weeks as long end interest rates have fallen so there could be scope for a rebound in the near future we ll get the latest mba mortgage application data later today in terms of the day ahead this morning in europe we ll get january confidence indicators out of france followed later on by the january cbi survey in the uk in the us this afternoon it ll be worth keeping an eye on the january richmond fed manufacturing survey 2 expected vs 8 previously in light of some weak regional fed surveys so far this month while the november fhfa house price index is also due out this afternoon we ll also get the january consumer confidence reading for the euro area away from that we re due to hear from the boe s broadbent while the second day

by melissa luz t lopez senior reporter the government will hold on to its 7 8 growth target this year according to finance secretary carlos g dominguez iii who noted the philippines has room to stand resilient despite a slowing global economy this after the philippine statistics authority psa revised the third quarter growth figure to 6 a tad slower than the previously reported 6 1 due to lower growth in some sectors such as manufacturing trade of motor vehicles and financial intermediation the nine month gross domestic product gdp average stands at 6 3 the fourth quarter and full year data is scheduled to be released today mr dominguez said on wednesday that the government will keep seven percent as the fighting target for 2019 at a time when multilateral lenders are scaling down global growth forecasts despite the headwinds presented by global factors last year we continued to grow our economy at an impressive rate we expect 2019 to be an even better year mr dominguez said in a speech before the financial executives institute of the philippines at the shangri la at the fort taguig pressed further the cabinet official said the economic team is keeping its 7 8 growth target this year even as latest estimates by market watchers like banks and multilateral agencies are betting on a slower pace the international monetary fund said global growth will decelerate to 3 5 this year from the 3 7 pace expected for 2018 at a time of weaker activity among advanced economies and trade tensions between the united states and china the united nations also sees increasing downside risks and vulnerabilities for global economic activity in its world economic situation and prospects 2019 the un expects the philippines to log a faster climb of 6 5 this year from 6 3 in 2018 fighting target it means to say we want to meet it we ll fight to meet it for 2019 mr dominguez told reporters noting that there will be ample domestic drivers to stimulate economic activity despite paling global prospects first of all we re not really a big international trader of course we are affected by the headwinds but because we have this build build build program we are sort of insulated and we have good credit we have good tax collections we are quite insulated prices crucial more market analysts are bullish about economic prospects for 2019 with inflation seen to finally tame in turn this could stoke consumer spending slower inflation is seen to persist as food supply normalizes and as world crude prices drop mr dominguez said making it almost certain that price increases will return to the 2 4 pace this 2019 in a separate report bank analysts at ubs said lower inflation would be the critical macroeconomic trend this year but said the economic growth will still ease to 6 1 from 6 4 in 2018 due to tighter monetary conditions and weak exports some lift is also expected this year as the central bank is unlikely to raise interest rates further as prices cool ubs said in a report published yesterday inflation averaged 5 2 last year well above the 2 4 target band substantial investments in infrastructure would likewise propel growth mr dominguez added as seen in the 50 increase in state spending from january november last year we are moving faster than expected the old problem of absorptive capacity has been overcome he added meanwhile mr dominguez pointed out that additional revenues drawn from the tax reform for acceleration and inclusion train law that took effect last year will continue supporting the more upbeat government spending with collections reaching p41 9 billion as of end september albeit short of the p44 3 billion target for the first nine months collections from tobacco excise and documentary stamp taxes were the biggest revenue sources under train so far mr dominguez also signalled confidence that package two of the tax reform program can still be passed within this year despite lukewarm reception among lawmakers and strong lobbying against the revamp of tax perks granted to new businesses the measure remains pending before congress with just a few weeks of sessions left before the midterm polls that would create a new house of representatives and leave half the 24 senate seats up for grabs q3 gdp revision meanwhile the statistics agency on wednesday reported the country s gdp which indicates the value of final goods and

he state s emergency board a panel of senior policymakers that adjusts vermont s official revenue projections moved tuesday to increase this year s general fund revenue forecast by 11 2 million and next year s by 1 6 million state economists advising the panel said that like in july when the board hiked the fiscal year 2019 forecast by 33 million vermont continues to benefit from a large boost in corporate tax revenue spurred by federal tax reforms enacted in 2017 but they once again cautioned the panel made up of gov phil scott and four legislative committee chairs that the trend of increased tax revenue could soon turn jeffrey carr the scott administration s economist and tom kavet the legislature s economist said a vibrant economy and recent tax reforms have supported the additional revenues which are likely to continue through fiscal year 2020 however the economists were less hopeful about fiscal year 2021 when the nation s economic trends could be reversing and revenue could start to be squeezed in fiscal year 2021 the combination of fed tightening receding fiscal stimulus and potential trade conflict could leave the general fund with virtually no more revenue in fiscal year 2021 than fiscal year 2020 kavet wrote in a report for the e board for fiscal year 2020 the e board increased the general fund revenue forecast by 1 6 million this comes after the panel hiked the 2020 forecast by 18 million in july the economists warned that the soaring u s economy will likely see a downturn in the coming years we re at the high end of a cycle and generally speaking the only direction you go from the high end is down kavet said the economists pointed to the fact that in the last year alone the federal reserve has raised interest rates on four occasions the fed raises interest rates to slow economic growth to sustainable levels and prevent inflation but kavet also wrote that primary recessionary threat stems from excessive federal reserve monetary tightening the increase in tax revenue the state will see this year can once again be largely attributed to corporate repatriation companies bringing funds held overseas back to the u s and paying a tax on that transfer the federal tax law passed in december of 2017 temporarily offers a lower tax rate for corporations moving their money back home states receive a portion of the repatriation dollars members of the e board noted tuesday that the revenue increases will not serve as ongoing sources of state funding i think it s important for all of us to just look at this as positive news but at the same time just be cautious scott told reporters after the meeting in crafting their budget for fiscal year 2020 the scott administration has said that all of the revenue increases projected for the year will be needed to cover accumulating debts including an increased payment to the state s massive teacher pension liabilities the state will need to spend roughly 40 million more on debt payments in the next fiscal year than it will this year according to adam greshin commissioner of the department of finance and management the e board also increased revenue projections for vermont s education fund mainly because the state is now collecting a new internet sales tax vermont and other states started collecting the tax when the supreme court voted in june to overturn a decades old case which had barred states from reaping sales taxes from businesses unless they had a local bricks and mortar presence last year legislators moved sales and use tax revenues into the education fund
when it comes to businesses in need of reform the saying size isn t everything should apply unfortunately this isn t the thinking in the realm of antitrust where size is seen as inextricably linked to questions of competitiveness political corruption the stifling of innovation and distortions of economic power at least that s the case made by professor tim wu in his new work the curse of bigness antitrust in the new gilded age reviewing the book new york times correspondent david leonhardt accepts wu s central premise the new corporate behemoths have been very good for their executives and largest shareholders and bad for almost everyone else sooner or later the companies tend to raise prices they hold down wages because where else are workers going to go they use their resources to sway government policy many of our economic ills like income stagnation and a decline in entrepreneurship stem partly from corporate gigantism if every corporate behemoth is seen as a problematic nail then a resort to the antitrust hammer is understandable but it is questionable whether or not the ills outlined above by wu and leonhardt are a product of economic gigantism per se a better reason why these pathologies exist is the following a sustained multi decade attack on unionization the concomitant growing imbalance between capital and labor the ascendancy of the doctrine of shareholder capitalism which has induced corporations to prioritize share price performance over r d and investment global labor arbitrage and the existence of america s pay to play system of politics entrenched and exacerbated by recent supreme court decisions such as citizens united to address these problems we need solutions that go well beyond breaking up a big corporation just because it happens to be big or simply embracing the neoliberal faith that letting markets be markets will do the job or for that matter relying on an archaic regulatory framework that sits uneasily with our 21st century version of capitalism while it is understandable why antitrust proponents such as wu evoke early examples of trust busters such as theodore roosevelt to garner support and provide historical legitimacy for their arguments it s hard to see how rules promulgated in the context of an early 20th century economy are germane to a 21st century global economy dominated by very different kinds of industries and market structures ironically a fitting lesson to be drawn from our nation s past is the one that today s antitrust enthusiasts generally ignore as the economists robert atkinson and michael lind illustrate one of the earliest trust busters president theodore roosevelt argued that the remedy for abuse was not mindlessly breaking up big firms but preventing specific abuses by means of a strong national regulation of interstate corporations likewise his cousin franklin delano roosevelt ultimately concluded that optimal outcomes were more likely to be achieved via prudent government oversight and using antitrust laws to police abuses not to break up every big company simply because it s big atkinson and lind expand these ideas in their bookbig is beautiful debunking the myth of small business on the size metric they make the following observation on virtually every meaningful indicator including wages productivity environmental protection exporting innovation employment diversity and tax compliance large firms as a group significantly outperform small firms echoing the roosevelts the authors argue that the remedy for abuse is not mindlessly breaking up big firms but preventing specific abuses by means of a strong national regulation of businesses regardless of size they also point out that the corollary namely that small is good is often wrong as well in spite of many americans long standing belief that small business is the main engine of job growth and economic opportunity in 2015 small enterprises were four times more likely to lay off their workers than large ones workers employed by large firms also earned more on average 54 percent more than workers at small companies companies with more than 500 employees offer 2 5 times more paid leave and insurance benefits and 3 9 times more in retirement benefits than workers at firms with fewer than 100 employees large firms are also more likely to be unionized and they employ a greater share of women and minorities than small firms do making big business an unlikely enemy of progressives even if small companies do not constitute the engine of growth are they not the main avatars of entrepreneurialism and american innovation while the image of steve jobs and steve wozniak beavering away in a garage to create apple has done much to legitimize this myth in reality as atkinson and lind document the tech revolution owes far more to teams of scientists and engineers working in well funded corporate labs than to college dropouts tinkering at home in support of this proposition the authors cite the study of professors anne marie knott and carl vieregger which shows that large firms not only invest more in r d than small firms they get more innovation output per dollar invested to the extent that american innovation and entrepreneurialism have dissipated in the last few decades the cause is less economic gigantism and more financialization especially post the establishment of sec rule 10b 18 which engendered an explosion in share buybacks until the rule was introduced companies buying back their own shares was considered a form of stock manipulation the impact of this rule cannot be overstated instead of spending needed dollars on r d or investment billions of dollars of corporate cash flow have been deployed toward stock repurchases to fatten executive compensation an additional contributing factor has been the diminishment of government involvement in the economy this is a salient consideration given the state s historic contributing role in transformational technologies from the internet to gps as venture capitalist william janeway has noted in his book doing capitalism in the innovation economy what about the notion that economic size has contributed to the problem of income stagnation and non existent wage growth here again the evidence suggests that other factors are more important in fact as the economists lance taylor and özlem ömer illustrate in a recent study the stagnant low wage sectors nursing homes fast food construction education and health business services transportation and warehousing maids are the least concentrated with the lowest profit margins concentration per se can t explain low wages in these industries companies in these sectors are usually the ones that complain the most about a 15 hour minimum wage or the unionization of their work forces claiming they don t have the economic resources to pay the kinds of wages and benefits often secured in union negotiated deals an inflation eroded minimum wage the absence of unions replacement of full time employees by contractors and mass low wage immigration are better explanations for wage stagnation and non enforcement of antitrust remedies is irrelevant to those causes wage and labor laws matter the decades long sustained attacks on unions have given corporations both large and small the power to break the traditional nexus between worker productivity and wage gains this development has generated a massive shift in income from labor to capital over the past 35 years to avert this problem policy should therefore be fighting against worker exploitation irrespective of whether workers are employed by amazon or mom and pop sweatshops targeting based on size alone won t get rid of all of the abuses in fact amazon implicitly proved that big is not always bad and sometimes can be better recall how quickly the company recently introduced the 15 hour minimum wage in response to vast public pressure ideally a robust competing private power center i e organized labor means corporations in the most feral analysis have to fight a two front war how to get there from here is a problem the democrats might be spending more time thinking about assuming they can take their single minded focus away from the evils of economic gigantism for fragmented sweatshop industries where a big three tripartite model among government unions and big business doesn t apply governments can substitute unionized wage boards that were created in the early 20th century in the uk and copied in the united states new york governor andrew cuomo for example has used a state wage board to raise the fast food wage wage boards with tripartite government employer worker representation can be used by u s states in low wage sectors that can t be removed to another state or country construction health care nursing restaurants they should have power over hours and working conditions not just wages as far as high tech industries go the question of regulation vs breaking up may miss the main worries especially in regard to some of our newer 21st century behemoths such as google or facebook facebook for example may have some features of being a broadcaster which would suggest fcc style oversight but that is still a relatively small part of its business similarly it would be difficult to call google a broadcaster in the traditional sense of an fcc regulated company although it should be subject to the 21st century equivalent of fair broadcast rules whether the fcc is fully equipped to promulgate and enforce those rules is another question communications have changed a lot over the last half century and media have taken on a multiplicity of functions that were not in existence when the fcc was established using a horse and carriage model for an internet superhighway is problematic both facebook and google collect massive amounts of private data which makes them different from broadcasters sell heavily targeted advertising offer tech solutions to the larger social media world and provide forms of services search and personal networking the regulation would need to come to grips with the interrelationship of the four or the nature of the vertical integration creating eight mini facebooks doesn t seem like a good way to do this especially if the problem of how the company handles your data isn t adequately addressed rather the european union s general data protection regulation represents a good starting basis for a new regulatory framework because it regulates function regardless of size what about our pay to play political system doesn t corporate size play a role here yes but this is because companies scale up in size in order to maximize their abilities to pay to play as professor thomas ferguson asserts in his seminal work golden rule the investment theory of party competition and the logic of money driven political systems with enough money candidates can pole vault over the whole rotting structure of party politics in america the scale up however is a function of inadequate restrictions on private campaign finance ferguson s book demonstrates that powerful blocs of business elites large and small with durable largely economic interests are a constant feature of american politics smaller businesses do it as well they too have an incentive to scale up via a trade association to maximize the impact of their political investment change the incentives in pay to play and size becomes less of a polluting impact on the american polity the corollary also applies if the government were suddenly to embrace an antitrust agenda and aggressively break up the big corporate behemoths absent campaign finance reform he who has the gold would still rule more generally it is worth considering the whole underlying premise that market considerations on their own deliver optimal social outcomes consider that in times of grave national emergency such as war market mechanisms are generally subjugated to broader strategic objectives we didn t use the market to help us win world war ii during which the u s rationed raw materials established wage and price controls capped profits organized cartels of manufacturers set production targets and directed labor into war munitions civilians were exhorted to put their savings into wartime bonds and the economy was largely controlled by federal bureaucrats like simon kuznets and generals like brehon somervell and bill knudsen by no means am i suggesting a comparable scale of government involvement today i am simply questioning the optimistic premise underlying traditional market oriented antitrust remedies some national development government led industrial policy must play a role in shaping market mechanisms to broader public purpose above all else the implicit assumption of the antitrusters seems to be that america is not capitalist enough and that more market competition will raise wages and lower prices and reduce inequality they posit a minimal role for a state involvement even though the state has historically played a large role in national development innovation and entrepreneurialism the monomaniacal focus on antitrust ironically sounds more like something from the cato institute or the koch brothers rather than a progressive plan to improve the aggregate quality of life for the majority of americans antitrust is an instrument that has its place but simply placing faith in benign outcomes by letting markets be markets or assuming that big is bad are theological doctrines not real solutions

increased five basis points compared to the net interest margin of 4 02 in the three months ended september 30 2018 primarily as a result of increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest earning deposits at the federal reserve bank partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on deposits and borrowings the increase in the margin from the prior year fourth quarter was primarily the result of increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest earning deposits at the federal reserve bank and an increase in the additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the acquired loan pools compared to the prior year period partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on deposits and borrowings the average interest rate spread was 3 79 for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to 3 58 for the three months ended

ongoing interest rate management strategies to hedge the risk of its floating rate loans the notional amount of the swap is 400 million with a termination date in october 2025 under the terms of the swap the company receives a fixed rate of interest of 3 018 and pays a floating rate of interest equal to one month usd libor the floating rate resets monthly and net settlements of interest due to from the counterparty also occur monthly the initial floating rate of interest was set at 2 277 with monthly adjustments to the floating rate occurring after that time to the extent that the fixed rate continues to exceed one month usd libor the company will receive net interest settlements which will be recorded as loan interest income if one month usd libor exceeds the fixed rate of interest in future periods the company will be required to pay net settlements to the counterparty and will record those net payments as a reduction of interest income on loans the company recorded loan interest income of 673 000 in the three months ended december 31 2018 the company s net interest margin has been positively impacted by significant additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the fdic assisted transactions on an on going basis the company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools for each of the loan portfolios acquired the cash flow estimates increased during the current and prior periods presented below based on payment histories and reduced credit loss expectations this resulted in increased income that has been spread on a level yield basis over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools and therefore has decreased over time additional estimated cash flows reclassification of discounts from non accretable to accretable totaling approximately 1 2 million and 5 2 million were recorded in the three months and year ended december 31 2018 respectively related to these acquired loan pools the impact of adjustments on all portfolios acquired in fdic assisted transactions for the reporting periods presented is shown below three

interest income during 2019 additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the fdic assisted transactions as the company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools excluding the impact of the additional yield accretion net interest margin for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 increased 25 and 25 basis points respectively when compared to the year ago periods the increase in net interest margin in the three month and annual periods is primarily due to increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest earning deposits at the federal reserve bank partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on deposits and fhlb advances and short term borrowings for additional information on

the act was signed into law among other things the act permanently lowers the corporate federal income tax rate to 21 from the prior maximum rate of 35 effective for tax years including or commencing january 1 2018 the company currently expects its effective tax rate combined federal and state to decrease from approximately 26 7 in 2017 to approximately 17 0 to 18 5 in 2018 and future periods mainly as a result of the act for the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the company s effective tax rate was 17 9 and 20 8 respectively for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the company s effective tax rate was 18 1 and 26 7 respectively these effective rates were lower than the statutory federal tax rates of 21 2018 and 35 2017 due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax exempt investments and tax exempt loans which reduced the company s effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the company s utilization of tax credits and the level of tax exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pre tax income the company s effective income tax rate is currently expected to continue to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to the factors noted above capital as of december 31 2018 total stockholders equity and common stockholders

loan portfolio presentation available on the company s investor relations website under presentations provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes is sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors including but not limited to past loss experience current portfolio mix actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio economic conditions and internal as well as external reviews the levels of non performing assets potential problem loans loan loss provisions and net charge offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict weak economic conditions higher inflation or interest rates or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses such as a watch list of possible problem loans documented loan administration policies and loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size loan type delinquencies financial analysis on going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work outs management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense if necessary to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended december 31 2018 was unchanged at 2 0 million when compared with the quarter ended december 31 2017 at december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 the allowance for loan losses was 38 4 million and 36 5 million respectively total net charge offs were 1 0 million and 1 7 million for the quarters ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively during the quarter ended december 31 2018 1 0 million of the total 1 0 million of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category with other loan categories experiencing net charge offs and recoveries which substantially offset each other total net charge offs were 5 2 million and 10 0 million for the year ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively during the year ended december 31 2018 3 9 million of the 5 2 million of net charge offs were in the consumer auto category in response to a more challenging consumer credit environment the company tightened its underwriting guidelines on automobile lending in the latter part of 2016 management took this step in an effort to improve credit quality in the portfolio and reduce delinquencies and charge offs this action also reduced origination volume and as such the outstanding balance of the company s automobile loans declined approximately 104 million in the year ended december 31 2018 we expect further declines in the automobile loan outstanding balance in 2019 in addition six commercial loan relationships amounted to 1 3 million of the total charge offs during the year ended december 31 2018 charge offs were partially offset by recoveries on multiple loans during the quarter and the year general market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge offs as assets were categorized as potential problem loans non performing loans or foreclosed assets evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate in june 2017 the loss sharing agreements for inter savings bank were terminated in april 2016 the loss sharing agreements for team bank vantus bank and sun security bank were terminated loans acquired from the fdic related to valley bank did not have a loss sharing agreement all acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy great southern bank portfolio with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes review of financial information collateral valuations and customer interaction to determine if additional reserves are warranted the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding fdic acquired loans was 0 99 1 01 and 1 00 at december 31 2018 december 31 2017 and september 30 2018 respectively management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio at december 31 2018 based on recent reviews of the bank s loan portfolio and current economic conditions if economic conditions were to deteriorate or management s assessment of the loan portfolio were to change it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition asset quality former teambank vantus bank sun security bank interbank and valley bank non performing assets including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non performing loans potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below these assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and are accounted for in pools therefore these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans the performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the five transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio changes in economic and market conditions and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances the level of non performing assets will fluctuate non performing assets excluding all fdic assisted acquired assets at december 31 2018 were 11 8 million a decrease of 16 0 million from 27 8 million at december 31 2017 and a decrease of 4 1

united states gaap these non gaap financial measures include core net interest income core net interest margin and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio we calculate core net interest income and core net interest margin by subtracting the impact of adjustments regarding changes in expected cash flows related to pools of loans we acquired through fdic assisted transactions from reported net interest income and net interest margin management believes that core net interest income and core net interest margin are useful in assessing the company s core performance and trends in light of the fluctuations that can occur related to updated estimates of the fair values of the loan pools acquired in the 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 fdic assisted transactions in calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets we subtract period end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations as it provides a method to assess management s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets which are subjective components of valuation facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers in addition management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap financial measures because not all companies use the same calculation of

two and a half years after the 2016 referendum vote to leave the european union eu the british capitalist class is mired in crisis the dominant pro remain faction is desperately manoeuvring to either overturn the result or at least secure a deal preserving tariff free access to the single european market on which it depends for 40 percent of trade and for london s role as a centre of financial speculation the pro brexit faction led by right wing tories and the sectarian thugs of the democratic unionist party resists all entreaties to compromise they believe the eu can be forced to accept the uk s terms through an alliance with the trump administration in washington such an arrangement would free britain to strike unilateral trade deals internationally and refashion britain as a singapore style free trade zone in europe based on crushing levels of exploitation the working class has no interest in backing either right wing faction the task is not to help overcome a bourgeois crisis of rule but to mobilise across europe to take power and implement a socialist programme millions of workers especially the younger generation look on with disgust at the naked xenophobia of the brexiteers warnings of more job losses economic downturn and deepening austerity the strengthening of far right forces and the return of visa requirements in europe however the claim that renewed membership of the eu is an answer is a lie the advocates of remain are all pro capitalist politicians who in all essentials share the anti working class agenda of the pro brexit tories they believe the interests of british imperialism are best pursued within the framework of a european trade bloc on every major question aside from brexit attacks on democratic rights anti strike laws as well as cuts to vital social services to funnel money to the big corporations and super rich and to fund predatory military interventions and wars the tories will all march in lockstep with the blairite wing of the labour party moreover the civilised europe that the advocates of remain invoke as an antidote to right wing british nationalism is a myth the brexit vote in 2016 was much larger than anticipated not because of racism but because of legitimate hostility to the eu as an instrument of capital that has imposed savage austerity against the working class throughout the continent this offensive continues and escalates since 2008 economists estimate that europe lost economic activity due to austerity measures imposed by its governments equivalent to spain s entire gdp about 1 3 trillion around 10 percent of people in the euro zone live in a household below the official poverty line with many more numbered among the working poor almost one in six workers in temporary and part time jobs were at risk of poverty in 2017 this month the social europe think tank issued a report that found the eu wide poverty rate based upon earning less than 9 760 a year stands at 28 2 percent 142 million out of a total population of around 500 million this is set to worsen with italy spain and even germany hovering on the brink of recession amid dire warnings that a second global economic crash is looming as for european politics the 2018 congress resolution of the socialist equality party britain explained that world capitalism is entering a new period of trade and military war driven by the fundamental contradictions between socialised production and the private ownership of the means of production and between a global economy and the division of the world into antagonistic nation states in response the ruling elite in every country is embracing nationalism authoritarianism and fascistic reaction brexit was only an initial expression of this disintegration of the post war european order the project of european unification under capitalism is being stripped of its liberal pretensions right wing movements are being assembled as a shock force against the working class and the doors of state office thrown open to the likes of the alternative for germany afd and italy s lega seven decades after the death of hitler the fascistic afd is the main opposition party in the german parliament while in france president macron pays tribute to the leader of the nazi collaborationist vichy regime marshal pétain the resolution explained the deep alienation from official politics expressed in the 2016 referendum is rooted in the extraordinary growth of social inequality and a hatred of the world s ruling elites who have benefited from this social misery this was acknowledged this month by the international monetary fund s david lipton who warned of lower levels of trust in the core institutions and of national governance that has in many respects fallen into disrepute one lingering resentment growing out of the global financial crisis was the perception that bankers were saved at the expense of the average worker lipton asked what might the next economic downturn produce history suggests such a downturn is somewhere over the horizon the response of the working class is already becoming clear in the form of an initial wave of strikes across europe in the united states mexico and around the world after decades in which the social democratic parties and trade unions worked successfully to suppress the class struggle and allow free rein to the major corporations and banks a mood of resistance is growing the yellow vest protests in france against president macron mass protests in hungary against the fidesz government s slave labour scheme and the strike by 70 000 mexican auto workers are all examples of the beginnings of a mass international movement against the financial oligarchy and its imposition of austerity it is essential that british workers intervene in the crisis over brexit based on their own class programme and interests to do so they must base themselves consciously on this emerging global movement of the working class this means rejecting all appeals by the various pseudo left groups to take sides with one or other faction of the ruling class and their insistence that workers entrust their fate to labour leader jeremy corbyn in 2016 the sep called for an active boycott of the brexit referendum warning there can be no good outcome of such a plebiscite whichever side wins working people will pay the price against the reactionary perspective of national economic development that was at the heart of the brexit agenda and support for the eu we called for workers to adopt the perspective of a unified struggle across the continent for the united socialist states of europe brexit and the pseudo left groups all the pseudo left groups lined up behind one or another capitalist faction with the socialist party and socialist workers party swp advocating a left leave vote portraying brexit as the basis for a national road to socialism through reforms implemented by a labour government led by jeremy corbyn left unity socialist resistance and the alliance for workers liberty also lined up behind corbyn and the labour party which backed remain while promoting the progressive virtues of the eu today the former advocates of left leave support a labour government as the answer to a brexit crisis which they played a central role in creating this is to be brought about by protests organised and controlled by the trade union bureaucracy to secure a general election to this end the socialist party urges the trade unions the largest democratic organisations of the working class to step up to the plate while counterfire insists the whole labour movement therefore has every interest in uniting to ensure that from this crisis the tories are forced to leave office and a general election is called no call is made for a struggle against either the trade union leaders or the blairites even as the swp admits the labour party is not mobilising its membership to act over the crisis the trade unions are spectating this is a massive political crisis but working class people are not being organised to shape the outcome the swp knows full well that the labour party and the trade unions are not merely spectating they are vehemently opposed to such a mobilisation of the working class because they serve the interests of big business the pseudo lefts are forced to hinge their fantasy politics on the claim that corbyn represents an opposition to the right wing in the unions and the labour party and even a socialist alternative this lie is becoming increasingly threadbare after three years in which he has bowed down before every programmatic demand of the blairites his performance during the brexit debacle should bury it corbyn has acted throughout in his central role of opposing the class struggle and insisting that all questions of principle must be subordinated to maintaining the unity of the labour party and doing only that which is possible through parliament if corbyn were serious about fighting for a general election to remove the tories this would be framed as a demand for action by the working class instead corbyn s appeal was to the blairites to allow him the right to move a motion of no confidence in the government and to the city of london based on his pledge to negotiate access to europe s markets if labour came to power now his motion of confidence has failed the blairites will move forward with their demand for a second referendum most likely with corbyn s blessing it is measure of the cynicism of the pseudo left that the theoretical leader of the swp alex callinicos acknowledges the fraudulent character of its socialist rhetoric he wrote december 18 in international socialism this journal has long opposed the eu as a dysfunctional would be imperialism that seeks to drive neoliberalism deep into its member states and its periphery on that basis we supported a vote to leave in 2016 but although we think it is right to stand against the eu we don t think that this is the most important issue for socialists in the january 22 socialist worker callinicos explained that what is important is to advise corbyn on how to negotiate with the eu corbyn has been attacked for having unrealistic red lines he writes but he has some cards in his hand if he went back to his previous support for free movement i e reversed his anti immigrant policies he would be extending a hand to left wing remainers and might actually improve britain s bargaining position with the eu writing in international viewpoint socialist resistance make clear that for them british imperialism remaining in the eu is of far greater importance than replacing the tories with a labour government in passages indistinguishable from tony blair they complain it is right to call for a general election but were it to happen it would be seriously problematic even at this late stage corbyn is unable to say whether labour s stand would be pro or anti brexit the only viable answer to this is a second referendum which remains the only chance of ending this whole process socialist resistance shows the interests it represents by praising the new york times for having defended a second referendum by saying that a democracy that does not allow people to think again is not a democracy and notes that support for a second referendum grows even amongst tory mps these positions fully substantiate the international committee of the fourth international s designation of the pseudo left groups as advocates of imperialist realpolitik however the factional conflict within the labour party and its pseudo left periphery ends nothing can emerge that genuinely articulates the interests of the working class including a second referendum that would prove to be as divisive as the first the answer to austerity is not a pro capitalist labour government dedicated to rebuilding national unity across the brexit divide but the unification of the working class against the capitalist class in a struggle for socialism workers must form organisations of class struggle independent from the labour and trade union bureaucracy to bring down the tories and form a workers government in this fight british workers have the most powerful allies in their brothers and sisters throughout the european continent together with our comrades in the international committee s european sections the sep in britain the parti de l égalité socialiste pes in france and the sozialistische gleichheitspartei sgp in germany we call for a unified struggle against the eu and its constituent governments to end the rule of the financial oligarchy and to establish the united socialist states of europe the author also recommends the resurgence of the class struggle and the tasks of the socialist equality party uk
