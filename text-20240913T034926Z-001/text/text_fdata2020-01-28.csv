monrovia president george manneh weah used his third annual message monday to lay out what senator j milton teahjay unity party sinoe would later describe as an ambitious undertaking the presidential address was to some extent comprehensive the ideas the president has laid out are ambitious but i am not sure we have the kind of economy to underwrite those ambitions the senator averred report by rodney d sieh but for a little over one hour and fifty minutes the president expressed confidence that the new year would see some positive projections for his administration now in its third year especially with a new emphasis on the agriculture sector which has been lying dormant for years and plans to open up the harper basin in bidding rounds in april roads will complement agriculture with these foundations in place we see no reason why the year 2020 cannot see positive growth we will work with determination vigor and focus to stabilize the macroeconomy reduce inflation and put liberians to work in agriculture and other key sectors president george manneh weah said the president liberia cannot realize full economic transformation without a vibrant agriculture program agriculture is critical to the kind of development my government strives to achieve this is why the sector remains a major pillar of the country s development agenda the president declared while foreseeing positive growth this year with these foundations in place we see no reason why the year 2020 cannot see positive growth we will work with determination vigor and focus to stabilize the macroeconomy reduce inflation and put liberians to work in agriculture and other key sectors this is why mr weah emphasized the issue of road connectivity he says should complement the agriculture sector with the program to connect the various communities and counties through quality paved road networks now fully mobilized funded and underway the next big push by my administration this year will be to reorganize the agriculture sector and put it at the front burner of our national development initiatives a greater investment in the sector the president noted will not only guarantee food security but will also provide jobs and a source of livelihood for thousands of families across liberia the president explained that his emphasis on the sector and the vision he has for liberia was a key reason why he delayed naming a new minister of agriculture that is why my vetting and selecting of a new agriculture minister was comprehensive and thorough i believe we have found the right person to lead this charge the nominee is a woman whose track record competence and dedication match my vision for agricultural transformation in liberia i hope that you will share my view and grant her speedy confirmation so that she can urgently embark upon the great task that is before her if she cannot do it then i do not know who else we will find to do it last two week the president named mrs jeanine cooper as his new minister succeeding dr mogana flomo who was relieved of his duties on june 29 2019 in order to get the sector moving again the president said his administration in the coming months intends to harness both local and international support and resources to lead the new agriculture drive which will focus on the entire value chain from the remote farmlands to the sprawling marketplaces across the country we will exert every effort to subsidize the works of more farmers and local cooperatives with the objective of enhancing productivity while the country has traditionally focused on rice production in previous years he said the new emphasis will not be shifted toward working with authorities in the sector and international counterparts to look at ways we can fully cultivate other cash crops such as cocoa and coffee citing example in neighboring west african countries gaining international acclaim for the production and exportation of cocoa and coffee the president said liberia should be following suit their natural endowment is not that different from ours therefore we will join ongoing efforts by the european union and others to revamp and make the coffee and cocoa sectors viable and profitable we will assist farmers to increase their yields through new farming methods and mechanization where will money come from this is where critics say the coming days weeks and months could prove pivotal matching senator teahjay s concerns about underwriting cost funding of the sector has always been a key detriment to farmers for example the draft national budget for the 2018 2019 fiscal year was us 488 8 million with us 8 3 million being appropriated for agriculture amounting to 1 69 of the total national budget of liberia while 62 1 went to recurring expenditures the bulk of which pays for huge salaries and allowances and logistics for top officials on monday the president said working in close collaboration with the legislature they have been able to pass a credible national budget at five hundred and twenty six million united states dollars us 526 million this budget brings public spending closest to the revenue received in the 2018 19 national budget in executing this budget we have taken steps to control spending so that we significantly reduce the deficit by the end of the fiscal year under the new budget agriculture was further slashed to us 6 208 754 infrastructure and basic services us 33 350 005 and industry and commerce account for us 6 066362 nevertheless the administration is promising a big push on the sector with plans to release some money through commercial banks to local rice producers the current budget has some 1 7 million for public sector investment in agriculture this money is intended to guarantee flexible lending to local rice and good crop growers the government is working to scale up investment in agriculture beyond the 1 7 million the world bank has agreed to pull in more money for agriculture on monday the president urged lawmakers to also take another look at forestry mining and fisheries laws to inject new and innovative thinking to include viable strategies for expansion of productive capacity best practices for better returns and gains as is the case in other jurisdictions over the years he said millions of dollars were put into agriculture with very little result to show this time around he says the new drive will tap on available knowledge and experience while working with international partners and local farmers to lead a new program that empowers liberians through agribusinesses in order to grow the economy this is where he says he will be leaning on his new appointee we expect the new minister if confirmed by the senate to bring harmony to the various efforts in the sector for efficiency and greater productivity we will be seeking the help of your honorable legislature in this regard working with the appropriate committees of both houses we have already secured the commitment of key local and international stakeholders who are supportive of our new drive to upgrade agriculture so that the country can reap its full benefits for president weah leapfrogging the process would be key traditional economics tell us that agriculture surplus should lead to industrialization but our government plans to leapfrog this process through the special economic zone concept it is our intention to promote labor intensive light manufacturing through the establishment of special economic zones we are cognizant of our infrastructure challenges which pose certain hurdles but with a well organized special economic zone program domestic production by small and medium enterprises will get the needed boost to spur economic growth rekindling harper

petroleum license in a competitive and transparent environment giving them the right to search for commercial deposits of oil liberia s last bid round was concluded december of 2014 with over 60 million dollars in commitments but concluded unsuccessfully due to political wrangling between the executive and legislative branches of government since the departure of exxon and chevron from liberia in 2016 2017 there have been no exploration work offshore liberia and the sector has been hanging on by a thread experts say the importance of liberia s next bid round cannot be overstated and will determine all future successes for liberia s fledgling oil sector the decline of oil prices in 2014 resulted in billions of dollars lost for exploration programs worldwide but with the resurgence of new investment and development monies liberia s bid round will be held in a very competitive environment of over sixty 60 countries offering blocks to only a handful of oil companies liberia will only have one opportunity to put its best foot forward a potential bottleneck here could lie in a possible breach of the petroleum law by the lpra surrounding deeco liberia limited a subsidiary of nigerian registered deeco oil and gas limited which applied to the authority for a reconnaissance license for an area in gbarnga bong county and the payment of one hundred united states dollars 100 000 00usd to the authority for the rights to do so the lpra granted deeco a reconnaissance license no lpra 001 to collect preliminary geological and geophysical data within the jorquelleh district contrary to standard oil and gas practices and in violation of the petroleum exploration production law 2014 without drafting or publishing the regulation for reconnaissance licenses the pre qualification requirements or conducting technical and financial due diligence on deeco the authority lpra collected 100 000usd and deposited the funds in its own account instead of the consolidated account as required by the public finance and petroleum e p laws shortly after issuing the license on june 1 2019 deeco issued a press release to the heritage newspaper that it had found oil in gbarnga the authority lpra and deeco subsequently refuted the claims of finding oil in a press release published by fpa and the daily observer on june 10 2019 fpa has learned that a reconnaissance licenses does not allow drilling making it impossible to discover oil yet in the fpa and daily observer articles deeco head is quoted as saying i re iterated that it is only after we have conducted seismic survey and hopefully drilled exploratory wells that a test may confirm oil in commercial quantity not realizing that his license does not allow for the drilling of a well despite his plans to rekindle interest in agriculture and the oil and gas sector the president is likely to face stiff challenges over declarations made monday regarding loans senator eyes probe over loans in his message the president said during the course of the year his administration was able to negotiate and sign sixteen 16 financing instruments with various development partners amounting to nearly two hundred and seventy four point thirty five million united states dollars us 274 35 million approximately one hundred and ninety four million united states dollars us 194 million of this amount are loans and about seventy nine million united states dollars us 79 million constitutes grants the president said the loans and grants are allocated as follows one hundred and twenty five point one million united states dollars us 125 1 million for road construction linking barclayville to sasstown voinjama to konia and sanniquellie to loguatuo forty seven million united states dollars us 47 million for improving results in secondary education twenty eight point ninety five million united states dollars us 28 95 million for improving urban water supply in monrovia seventy one point eight million united states dollars us 71 8 million for improving agriculture and six point five million united states dollars us 6 5 million for youth empowerment and employment ironically senator nyonblee karnga lawrence liberty party grand bassa told frontpageafrica afterwards she has some concerns as co chair on ways means and finance of the liberian senate the president spoke about many loans and grants and i don t recall those loans and grants coming through the liberian budget and i am going to do some investigation to know how those appropriations were made nevertheless the president told the nation monday that government s public debt has increased largely because the country has had to finance major infrastructure projects over the last several years as at end december 2019 the total stock of public debt amounted to one point twenty seven billion united states dollars us 1 27 billion this represents an increase of two hundred and eighty two million united states dollars us 282 million or twenty eight point five percent 28 5 of our debt stock compared to the nine hundred and eighty seven point eight million united states dollars us 987 8 million recorded at the end of 2018 according to the president the increase in the debt stock was mainly driven by disbursements from the world bank the african development bank the international fund for agricultural development the saudi development fund and other creditors which totaled one hundred and twenty nine point five million united states dollars us 129 5 million these were loans signed and ratified by the previous administration as part of the imf supported program the government of liberia has now fully reconciled and rationalized all government obligations to the central bank of liberia as of january 1 2020 total government debt to the central bank of liberia has been put at four hundred and eighty seven million united states dollars us 487 million the president explained that 7 8 of that amount or thirty eight million united states dollars us 38 million represents borrowing by the current administration in the previous two fiscal years the government has agreed to pay interest at the rate of four percent 4 per annum to the central bank on the principal amount owed with a grace period of 10 years on principal payment dillon points out contradictions the president added that another major driver of the increase in debt stock was the effort by his administration to consolidate accrued obligations by state owned enterprises and exposure to local commercial banks totaling one hundred and eighteen point five million united states dollars us 118 5 million these include nasscorp and seven commercial banks including lbdi afriland bank ecobank ib bank uba gn bank and gt bank debts owed to the commercial banks include longstanding government obligations of sixty five point two million united states dollars us 65 2 million which was the result of pre financing of government s heavy fuel oil infrastructure projects government s guarantee to the rubber planters association of liberia in 2014 direct payments made on behalf of the government and loans given to companies for pre financing of various government infrastructure projects last year alone he said the africa export import bank approved a bond discount facility that will disburse some fifty two million united states dollars us 52 million to commercial banks as settlement of the sixty five point two million united states dollars us 65 2 million owed by the government this flow will provide strong relief for commercial banks which faced serious liquidity challenges in the year under review the domestic debt profile given above does not include domestic debt owed to vendors and businesses who have supplied goods and services to the government over the years i am reliably informed that as far back as 2006 the government of liberia conducted an audit of domestic debt owed to vendors yet up to today this situation remains unclear he said his administration will conduct a new round of audits in 2020 to determine a rationalized and fully reconciled domestic debt figure to complete our domestic debt profile a payment framework will be developed after this reconciliation which may include packaging the debt as a bond for issuance to local and international financial markets in a year expected to be dominated by the upcoming mid term senatorial elections president weah faces an uphill task in shoring up finance and support to support his ambitious agenda even as the imf the world bank and other international stakeholders work with the administration to avert a financial meltdown some political observers took issue with the presidents contradictory calls on liberians to work with him to achieve his goals senator abraham darius dillon liberty party montserrado county a fierce critic of the president told frontpageafrica monday after the speech some of the president s declarations had holes that need to be filled the president was at one point calling on liberians to work with him and on the other side calling liberians dissidents the president said we should not judge him by his eloquence but by his decision but his actions have been poor i had hoped that the president would have spoken about the recent health outbreak in china and how prepare is our country to respond if the president is honest about asset recovery let him show us his assets and demand his officials in the spirit of transparency to do the same so we can know how they acquired their wealth for senator

cross border traders many of whom are women face harassment and corruption which can undermine these potential gains this paper presents evidence from a randomized controlled trial of a training intervention that provided access to information on procedures tariffs and rights to small scale traders to facilitate border crossings lower corruption and reduce gender based violence along the drc rwanda border the training reduces bribe payment by 5 percentage points in the full sample and by 27 5 percentage points on average among compliers the training also reduces the incidence of gender based violence by 5 4 percentage points 30 5 percentage points among compliers the paper pdf assesses competing explanations for the impacts using a game theoretic model based on hirschman s exit voice and loyalty framework the effects are achieved through early border crossings at unofficial hours exit instead of traders use of voice mechanisms or reduced rent seeking from border officials these results highlight the need to improve governance and establish clear cross border trade regulations particularly on the drc side of the border gender mainstreaming in afcfta national implementation strategies an inclusive and sustainable pathway towards gender equality in africa uneca although there are a number of provisions in the afcfta agreement that can expand the capacity of women to participate in economic and trade opportunities the benefits of afcfta for women are not automatic furthermore consideration will need to be given to the potential differential impact of afcfta provisions and the implementation of the agreement in a manner that opens up new opportunities for women in particular vulnerable women enhances their economic participation as a whole and helps them to integrate more fully into high paid sectors of the economy rwanda economic update accelerating digital transformation world bank this edition s forecast of rwanda s economic growth for 2019 is revised upward from the 7 8 projected in the reu14 to 8 5 the stronger growth is driven mostly by the unexpected magnitude of the fiscal expansion medium term growth also looks strong with annual growth projected to be about 8 although the current public investment push will continue in the medium term this issue s high growth scenario assumes that the role of the private sector in investment will grow public investments alone may not sustain growth at 8 over the medium term the risks to rwanda s economic outlook both domestic and external have risen the main risk is the growing reliance on public sectored investments fiscal expansion to achieve the government s targets for expanding access to infrastructure raises the debt widens external imbalances and may crowd out access of the private sector to finance thus undermining long term growth if the reliance on the public sector persists rwanda may have difficulties in financing its growth model rwanda s commitment to concessional borrowing and monetary stability reduces the risks to macroeconomic stability but overall fiscal risks has gone up because of the reliance on the public sector for achieving nst1growth targets despite continuing efforts the ineffectiveness of the private sector remains a major risk to rwanda s growth outlook growth projections for the medium to long term depend on the ability of the private sector to take the lead extract pdf external imbalances are widening reflecting on the one hand wider fiscal deficits and heavy demand for imports and on the other weaker than expected exports the impressive growth in goods exports in 2017 proved to be a one off phenomenon in us dollar terms since 2018 the growth rate of exports has slowed and the trend continued into 2019 international prices for the commodities rwanda exports were low and export volumes of coffee tea and minerals stagnated or declined imports grew by 19 in us dollar terms in h1 driven by capital and intermediate goods in the 12 months ending in june 2019 the current account deficit widened to 8 9 of gdp the surge in import demand has put pressures on foreign exchange reserves republic of congo 2019 article iv consultation imf the external current account is expected to record a substantial surplus for a second year in a row after registering large deficits that exceeded 50 of gdp over the 2015 16 period the current account balance reached a surplus of about 7¼ of gdp in 2018 this surplus is expected to continue in 2019 and reach about 8 of gdp the main factors driving the improvement are the recovery in oil exports and new mining exports coming on stream congo is considered in debt distress due to the accumulated external and domestic arrears external payment arrears have increased in recent years as financial difficulties have prevented congo from servicing its debt by september 2019 congo had accumulated 181m in official bilateral external arrears in addition to the stock of unrestructured pre hipc arrears moreover congo has also accumulated substantial external commercial arrears with oil traders as well as domestic arrears the total public debt level at the end september 2019 was estimated at 87 8 of gdp with external public debt at 62 3 of gdp of which about 20 of gdp was in arrears debt is assessed to be unsustainable absent restructuring selected issues report theme non oil revenue mobilization key challenges and reforms non oil revenues in the republic of congo have followed a generally positive trend since 1995 though there has been a substantial decline in recent years from 1995 to 2014 non oil revenues doubled figure 1 reaching 30 of non oil gdp however this positive trend was reversed in 2014 due to the decline in oil prices that triggered a deep economic crisis non oil revenues in congo are relatively high compared to other oil producing countries in sub saharan africa figure 2 however these calculations need to be interpreted with caution given the fact that non oil gdp could be underestimated the authorities should step up revenue mobilization as a key component of their medium term fiscal strategy this will require a well sequenced structure of reforms that includes three key elements ethiopia imf executive board concludes 2019 article iv consultation imf executive directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal they noted that ethiopia s growth model driven by public investment had supported rapid growth and remarkably improved living standards over the past decade at the same time it has led to a build up of debt and external vulnerabilities directors highlighted the urgency of fundamental reforms to correct macroeconomic imbalances ease structural bottlenecks and lay the foundation for sustainable inclusive growth led by the private sector to this end directors welcomed the ambitious homegrown economic reform plan which is appropriately built around macroeconomic structural and sectoral reforms they considered that the plan together with the authorities strong ownership and commitment deserves fund support which would help catalyze private investment and donor financing noting high implementation risks amid external vulnerabilities and political uncertainty directors underscored that steadfast determination strong communication and social protection would be key to obtain a broad based public buy in they also urged the authorities to seek additional debt reprofiling from external creditors to improve debt dynamics directors supported a comprehensive approach to addressing the exchange rate

harare s downtown shops mbare and the informal sector have dollarised on their own for various reasons to try to stay afloat in a hyperinflationary economy stir the pot paidamoyo muzulu harare s downtown shops mbare and the informal sector have dollarised on their own for various reasons to try to stay afloat in a hyperinflationary economy in a country where the government and central bank have basically abdicated their responsibilities zimbabweans have taken issues into their own hands they now trade in hard currency primarily the us dollar and to some extent the south african rand zimbabweans generally no longer trust their government after the local currency and savings were wiped out twice in a decade because of government ineptitude in 2008 the old zimdollar failed to stand hyperinflation and prices were being adjusted a minimum three times a day no one could be certain as quotations lost their value and all business was reduced to cash on delivery in 2009 the government officially adopted a basket of multi currencies but the base currency was the us dollar it is not clear why this stupid decision was taken how did the zanu pf government settle for the greenback ahead of the rand or botswana pula it can only boil down to political expediency and pleasing the bretton woods institutions what is money anyway professor harari in his seminal book homo sapiens a brief history of mankind was very clear that money is just a myth as religion this is powerful all world currencies having nothing that back them since they moved off the gold standard after world war ii now all currencies are based on production or the dubious position of the us dollar as the international medium of exchange i say dubious because no african country or developing country was at the table that decided to create the marshall plan international monetary fund and the world bank as enablers of international trade it cannot be over emphasised that the bretton woods institutions are based in the united states if it is about value why does the world not use the british pound or the euro which are both more powerful than the us dollar what zimbabwe needs is a complete paradigm shift on governance a competent government that is clear on and consistent in its policies a government for example cannot say the policy in the country is we have a mono currency zimdollar but in the same breath say other services it offers are paid for in us dollars the greatest beneficiaries of dollarisation are the big companies brewers telcoms fuel suppliers and wholesalers who were all charging way above regional prices in us dollars for the past decade it gave them a privileged position to harvest greenbacks and expand into the region or continent they yearn for the return to the period of deregulation when they could move money across borders without questions a case in point is the multiple tier pricing in the zimbabwean economy where settling a bill in electronic money or cash has different rates or worse still a discount if paying in greenbacks though illegal many are accepting it openly for their services who is benefiting from this arbitrage i have travelled in the region extensively everywhere i went they insisted on payment in their local currency traders would direct you to a bank or bureau de change to exchange your greenbacks into local currency i witnessed this in botswana mozambique malawi and zambia in lesotho eswathini and namibia they accept local currency or rand which is at par with their own currencies so where did we get it wrong it was in chimanimani when live on national television president emmerson mnangagwa in a moment of delusion or a dry joke do not know what it was said united states dollars were the real money not bond notes this was profound a whole president denigrating his own currency when extolling the virtues of some other currency remains etched in the collective memory of the citizens can he change that it is practically impossible because the experiences of the past decade have taught zimbabweans otherwise it may be time that zimbabweans have to sit down and discuss what is money in their perception basically money should be a medium of exchange and a store of value the storing of value is a duty of the central bank controlling not only inflation but also running a tight monetary policy on the other hand treasury having fiscal discipline that is the only way money can store value however zimbabwe is very different the central bank and government each day conspire to devalue the local currency by printing more money via treasury bills fiscal indiscipline by government departments and the cost of corruption which pushes the costs of projects beyond what they should normally cost if it is agreed that money is a myth then it is possible to understand why the people need a change of government and see it as a possible factor to spur economic change and local currency gaining value the bottom line remains zimbabweans should produce trade and save in local currency on the proviso that the central bank and treasury play their role to preserve the value of the local currency through good policies redollarisation is a painkiller it may take the pain away for a moment but the structural issues affecting the economy will remain and fester in the medium term it is time for a real discussion by all progressive forces meeting and shaping the way forward after all money is a myth we need to up our belief that it is a real thing paidamoyo muzulu is a journalist and writes

yesterday and opened at 42 504 69 today meanwhile the psx management has convened a meeting on wednesday to bring brokers on board the letter to the regulator added that the regulator seems unaware of progress made by stock brokerage industry over anti money laundering countering terror financing and the financial action task force aml cft fatf regimes moreover the stock market declined by more than 50pc from may 2017 when it was at 53 500 level to 28 000 without any clearing and settlement default this clearly reflects that exposure margins acquired by front line regulators have also minimised if not eroded the existence of clearing and settlement risk the letter added the situation will not strengthen the capital market nor restore investor s confidence and the regulator s actions will aggravate crises the letter stated the psa has referred to the pakistan national risk assessment report issued by the ministry of economic affairs in september 2019 several traders are of the view that pakistan is unlikely to exit the grey list of the financial action task force fatf next month despite an active support of its close ally china and tactical support of some western countries traders had opined that the market was still in search of a direction which could be provided by the state bank monetary policy and the herald of corporate results reporting season next week traders were of the view that after a major run up since august last year the index was consolidating at the current levels before moving forward early trade has been witnessing much of the volatility and the index has been fluctuating from negatives to positives and vice versa earlier investors optimism continued as they saw the market back in the green after two earlier dismal years of negative returns from aug 16 2019 when the benchmark index had hit the pit at 28 765 points the market has witnessed a spectacular rally that has carried it up by more than 50pc in fewer than five months

business news of tuesday 28 january 2020 source www classfmonline com external global factors which impact the stability of the ghana cedi are also part of the economic fundamentals and not just the internal ones which are under the control of the government a professor of economics at the university of guelph in canada and a fellow of the center for economic studies and the ifo institute for economic research cesifo in munich germany has told vice president dr mahamudu bawumia prof atsu amegashie who is also a d d fellow at cdd ghana and the tshepo institute of wilfrid laurier university canada argued in an article titled if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you that if a country s fundamentals were the only determinants of its exchange rate its currency will either depreciate against all currencies at the same time for example when its fundamentals are weak or appreciate against all currencies at the same time prof amegashie whose field of specialisation are public economics development economics and microeconomics therefore said the weakness or sturdiness of the fundamentals cannot only be of the internal factors in defence of his 2014 quote which he made while in opposition with which the biggest opposition party the national democratic congress ndc has been haunting him the vice president in april 2019 described as warped the reasoning by the ndc in saying that the fact that there had been a fall in the value of the cedi necessarily meant ghana s economic fundamentals were weak dr bawumia said the cedi fall at the time was largely due to external factors rather than weak internal fundamentals of the economy unlike in his opinion it pertained in 2014 when he made his now famous comment according to dr bawumia factors such as the inflation rate the balance of trade the fiscal balance money supply are what we refer to as the fundamentals but speculation and expectations about these fundamentals external shocks such as oil price increases can also have powerful short term effects on the exchange rate when we see pressures on the exchange rate first we need to determine where these pressures are coming from or whether the pressures are transitory or permanent and as every astute central banker knows even with strong economic fundamentals speculation expectation and investor sentiment can exert pressures on the exchange rate ladies and gentlemen you will recall that i stated in 2014 that if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you that was true then and it s true now it is 100 per cent correct but it is warped logic to jump from that to a conclusion that if there is depreciation in your currency then the fundamentals must be weak do you understand the logic if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you but if the exchange rate moves you cannot jump to that conclusion that the fundamentals are weak that defies logic dr bawumia said adding there could be external factors causing the exchange rate depreciation for example dr bawumia said if i tell you that if your leg is broken you are going to be unable to walk then i m somewhere and somebody comes to tell me this person is unable to walk can i just conclude that the leg must be broken there can be other reasons why you are unable to walk but the ndc logic will insist in the face of contrary evidence that since you cannot walk it must mean that your leg has broken in 2014 the economic fundamentals had weakened significantly and therefore the depreciation was easily explained it was not caused by dwarfs or high rise buildings as we were told the exchange rate for 2014 had exposed the weak economic fundamentals if you look on the screen it gives you the fundamentals as we had it in 2014 and 2018 every single one of them real gdp growth inflation the fiscal balance the wage bill wage bill to gdp gross debt interest rate current account all the fundamentals you ll see that we were in a much weaker position in 2014 compared to 2018 so ladies and gentlemen how have the cedi performed recently at the end of december 2017 the cedi had cumulatively depreciated by 4 9 per cent compared to 9 6 per cent in 2016 and this was the cedi s best performance since 2011 and at the end of 2017 we had the best performance of the cedi till 2011 the cedi however depreciated by 8 4 percent in 2018 largely on account of the emerging market pressure and us interest rate increase the data on the annual rate of depreciation of the cedi in recent years show that the worst performance of the cedi so far under the npp government the 8 4 per cent depreciation that we saw since 2018 that worst performance is better than the best performance under the previous government between 2012 and 2016 so our worst is better than your best and when you say this this one is more like boot for chalewote ladies and gentlemen the start of 2019 has been characterised by another sudden sharp depreciation of the cedi which has largely been reversed within a week the cedi went up close to ghs5 9 to the dollar and then it retreated back to ghs5 07 and even was threatening to go below ghs5 but this is really an unprecedented development that you don t normally see such a retreat when the exchange rate depreciates and you ll see that in this period when there was a reversal in the cedi depreciation the bank of ghana had not intervened in the market dr bawumia said in response to dr bawumia s argument prof amegashie said of course logic 101 tells that the converse of a statement is not necessarily true if x then y does not necessarily imply if y then x bawumia s point was that a country s fundamentals may be strong but other unfavourable external factors may be strong enough to cause depreciation in the external value of a currency the minister of finance ken ofori atta has also attributed the depreciation of the cedi to external pressures and indicated that strong fundamentals should stabilise the cedi indeed he asserted external factors affect exchange rates adding but those external factors are also fundamentals he explained in the determination of exchange rates a country s own fundamentals e g inflation interest rates gdp growth trade balance budget deficits money supply etc are not the only explanatory variables in fact the variables used are relative fundamentals i e the country s fundamentals relative to the fundamentals of a foreign country for example a seminal paper published in 1983 on the determination of exchange rates by richard meese then at the university of california berkeley and kenneth rogoff of harvard university used the following variables the ratio of the u s money supply to foreign money supply ratio of u s to foreign real gdp the short term interest rate differential between the us and a foreign country the expected long run inflation differential between the us and a foreign country and the accumulated u s and foreign trade balances thus other external factors are part of the fundamentals if a country s fundamentals were the only determinants of its exchange rate its currency will either depreciate against all currencies at the same time for example when its fundamentals are weak or appreciate against all currencies at the same time in reality this is not always the case it is common for the same currency to depreciate relative to some currencies but appreciate relative to other currencies at the same time it is not the absolute strength of your fundamentals that matters it is the relative strength of your fundamentals therefore if other external factors caused the depreciation of the cedi in 2019 it was reasonable to claim that ghana had weak fundamentals relative to the fundamentals of its trading partners read prof atsu amegashie s full article below if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you by j atsu amegashie january 26 2020 the formation of the foreign exchange fx development committee chaired by the minister of finance ken ofori atta has revived discussions about a statement by vice president dr mahamudu bawumia in 2014 dr mahamudu bawumia while commenting on the continuous depreciation of the cedi said that if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you at that time his party the new patriotic party npp was in opposition in response to the cedi s depreciation in 2019 dr bawumia as vice president of ghana and head of the economic management team emt defended his claim about exchange rates and macroeconomic fundamentals as follows you will recall that i stated in 2014 that if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you that was true then and it is true now it is 100 correct so if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you but it s warped logic to jump from that to a conclusion that if there is depreciation in your currency then the fundamentals must be weak it is a very warped logic if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you but if the exchange rate moves you cannot jump to that conclusion that the fundamentals are weak that defies logic there could be other external factors causing the exchange rate depreciation of course logic 101 tells that the converse of a statement is not necessarily true if x then y does not necessarily imply if y then x bawumia s point was that a country s fundamentals may be strong but other unfavourable external factors may be strong enough to cause depreciation in the external value of a currency the minister of finance ken ofori atta has also attributed the depreciation of the cedi to external pressures and indicated that strong fundamentals should stabilise the cedi indeed external factors affect exchange rates but those external factors are also fundamentals in the determination of exchange rates a country s own fundamentals e g inflation interest rates gdp growth trade balance budget deficits money supply etc are not the only explanatory variables in fact the variables used are relative fundamentals i e the country s fundamentals relative to the fundamentals of a foreign country for example a seminal paper published in 1983 on the determination of exchange rates by richard meese then at the university of california berkeley and kenneth rogoff of harvard university used the following variables the ratio

absolute strength of your fundamentals that matters it is the relative strength of your fundamentals therefore if other external factors caused the depreciation of the cedi in 2019 it was reasonable to claim that ghana had weak fundamentals relative to the fundamentals of its trading partners in the aforementioned paper meese and rogoff 1983 compared the forecasting accuracy of various exchange rate models surprisingly they found that that a random walk model performed as well as any estimated model at one to twelve month horizons for the dollar pound dollar mark dollar yen and trade weighted dollar exchange rates the random walk model used the current exchange rate as a predictor of future exchange rates it did not use fundamentals and yet performed as well as fundamentals based models attempts to overturn this result known as the meese rogoff puzzle has been the focus of researchers for several years it has stood the test of time in fact there is ample evidence of a weak or non existent relationship between exchange rates and fundamentals over short periods maurice obstfeld and kenneth rogoff coined the term exchange rate disconnect puzzle for the weak short run relationship between the exchange rate and macroeconomic fundamentals e g obstfeld and rogoff 2001 in subsequent studies researchers found that models based on fundamentals performed better than the random walk model for horizons longer than a year the consensus is that the macroeconomic fundamentals have little effect on exchange rates at short horizons but do have an impact at longer horizons e g mark 2005 therefore even if a country s fundamentals are relatively strong they may not be good predictors of daily weekly or monthly exchange rates the fact that fundamentals have much less variability than exchange rates during short periods may account for the exchange rate disconnect puzzle meese 1990 based on surveys of foreign currency traders in the us and hong kong some researchers found that interest rates matter more than other fundamentals lui and mole 1998 cheung and chinn 2001 using a large sample of individual professionals forecasters dick et al 2015 concluded that exchange rate forecasters largely agree that an interest rate increase relates to a currency appreciation but only good forecasters get expected interest rates right the preceding discussion suggest that exchange rates are not only determined by current fundamentals but also by expectations of fundamentals it turns out that expected future fundamentals weaken the relationship between current fundamentals and the exchange rate recent models have included order flow in forex markets as a proxy for expectations of future macroeconomic fundamentals lyons 2001 order flow is defined as the difference between buyer initiated and seller initiated currency transactions especially by large currency traders like banks and is a measure of net buying pressure on a particular currency you may think about it as the gap between demand for and supply of foreign currency evans and lyons 2007 showed that citibank customer order flow had substantial predictive power for future gdp inflation and money supply rime et al 2010 also found that order flows were linked to macroeconomic fundamentals according to rime sarno and sojli 2010 previous research has found that order flow has strong explanatory power for exchange rate movements whereas macroeconomic fundamentals have weak explanatory power we provide evidence that i order flow is intimately related to a broad set of current and expected macroeconomic fundamentals and ii more importantly order flow is a powerful predictor of daily movements in exchange rates this finding may provide a rationale for the high explanatory power of order flow found in the literature furthermore it suggests that macroeconomic fundamentals are indeed relevant for exchange rate determination but that the order flow channel is key to link exchange rates to fundamentals the seasonal short run or periodic episodes of significant deprecation of the cedi are unlikely to be affected by moderate and favorable levels of conventional and current macroeconomic fundamentals e g current inflation and growth rates thus in the short run we should go back to what everyone knows basic demand and supply analysis something akin to order flows and expected macroeconomic fundamentals these are the outflows and inflows of dollars demand for imports dollar inflows from cocobod fdi periodic repatriation of profits and dividends by foreign firms unfavourable foreign exchange retention agreements or weak enforcement of such agreements etc for example the cedi having depreciated for several months appreciated from gh 5 9 us in the last week of march 2019 to gh 5 1 us in the third week of april 2019 after the government of ghana raised 3 billion through a eurobond issue see addison 2019 ah demand and supply of dollars borrowing money to prop up the cedi is not a sustainable solution ultimately the most important fundamental is the heavily import dependent nature of our economy i am not the first to make this point it is not rocket science in conclusion if the relative fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you in the long run and if the exchange rate exposes you in the long run then the relative fundamentals are weak

q1 2020 than q4 2019 story nab yesterday reiterated the case for a rate cut next week the market has substantially reduced pricing for a february interest rate cut following the surprise improvement in the unemployment rate last week while we acknowledge there s a risk that the rba may wait a little longer to ease we continue to expect the rba to cut the cash rate to 0 5 in february in our view the 31 chance of a february rate cut currently priced by markets is to low the probability of a rate cut seems closer to 50 50 even if the reserve bank stays on hold next week we continue to see two further rate cuts this year and the possibility of quantitative easing if the unemployment rate deteriorates more quickly than we forecast in our view the continuing weakness in consumer spending and the above nairu unemployment rate mean further policy support is needed today s agenda local leading index december consumer price index fourth quarter rbc capital markets the q4 inflation report is the last key input to the rba decision next week our economists are in line with consensus expecting headline inflation steady at 1 7 y y a near 5 rise in fuel adds 0 15ppt with further drought driven

valley news west lebanon nh for the washington post even as a bitter and partisan impeachment trial plays out in washington the signals emanating from the economy continue to be amazingly positive the unemployment rate is at record lows the stock market is near record highs corporate profits remain strong and growth at around 2 percent is the highest among advanced economies at some level this disconnect between economics and politics reflects the underlying strength of the u s economy the innovation the efficient use of labor and capital the quality of management that existed long before donald trump became president business and economic fundamentals don t change overnight but americans should understand that there will be a significant long term economic cost to our polarized politics and dysfunctional government which has now reached the point of near total breakdown of comity and cooperation between the parties between the houses of congress and among the various branches of government in the modern era there are few if any examples of a country with a healthy thriving economy and a broken political system what distinguishes a successful economy from a failing one what distinguishes denmark from italy and south korea from north is not how much capital it has or technology it produces but the quality of its institutions the laws rules norms and policies that create the framework in which any economy operates and there should be no doubt that as a result of broken politics the quality of the united states institutions is already on the decline we can see such deterioration in our inability to adapt to changing conditions the rise of china as an economic superpower the influx of economic and political refugees and the threat from global warming people will inevitably disagree about how to deal with these serious economic challenges but a country with a working political system would rather after a modest debate embrace the obvious compromises building on what works and fixing what doesn t in the united states by contrast our approach has been to deny the problem demonize those with whom we disagree and ostracize anyone who dares to compromise as a result we now have millions of blue collar workers who are idle or underemployed millions of immigrants without the skills we need who entered the country illegally but too few of the skilled immigrants that we do and an unending series of devastating floods wildfires droughts and other extreme weather events the cost in terms of lost output and economic damage runs to tens of billions of dollars every year we see our institutional decline in the persistence of a health care system that continues to cost twice as much as in other countries while delivering some of the worst health outcomes in the industrialized world the reasons are not seriously in dispute too much care that is unnecessary and too little of the kind that keeps people healthy and corporate profits and medical salaries that are higher than necessary to attract talent and incentivize investment and innovation for decades opposition from special interest groups prevented anything from being done when it finally was obamacare most of those same interests used everything within their power to make sure even this modest reform would not succeed economists anne case and angus deaton recently calculated the direct cost of all this overspending at about 1 trillion a year or 8 000 for every household in the country the indirect costs in terms of lost output due to preventable death and illness and lost sales on global markets because of excessive labor costs surely add hundreds of billions more we also see the effects of political dysfunction in the inability of congress to come anywhere near balancing the federal budget even when the economy is seemingly operating at capacity in reality our current economic boom is a keynesian mirage the only reason our economy is growing at all is that because of extravagant tax cuts and undisciplined spending the federal government last year spent 1 trillion more than it brought in even as the federal reserve injects an additional 60 billion a month into the financial system as the international monetary fund warned in its annual economic outlook last fall such a level of fiscal and monetary stimulus is not sustainable creating risks of inflation a spike in interest rates or a sharp decline in the value of the dollar any of which in turn could lead to a recession or financial crisis in the longer run this addiction to living beyond our means will also have the effect of making us ever more beholden to the foreign lenders and investors who make it possible it would be one thing if we were productively investing all this borrowed or freshly printed money rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure providing effective job training to displaced workers or improving educational outcomes of our children these are the kinds of high payoff public investments that a functioning political system would be making instead we are essentially throwing the money down the drain by using it to finance runaway defense spending and farm subsidies and extravagant tax cuts for businesses that have mostly been passed on to shareholders but perhaps the greatest threat to the u s economy is the deterioration in the rule of law that has become a hallmark of the trump presidency and now lies at the heart of the unfolding impeachment process global companies do not invest in countries with autocratic leaders who arbitrarily impose economic sanctions or punitive tariffs on longtime allies who fail to perform political favors or take a different approach to unrelated foreign policy issues and the experience of other countries tells us that households and businesses do not pay their full share of taxes where leaders boast about paying no taxes at all and do not adhere to immigration rules when leaders are seen to flagrantly violate them this is other countries right we know that competition does not thrive in countries where leaders threaten criminal prosecution of political opponents and fire diplomats and civil servants who expose their corruption nor do markets flourish in countries where tariff waivers are handed out to political allies government contracts are withheld from political critics government regulations are not enforced against campaign contributors and companies are subject to antitrust investigations for lobbying against government policies rule of law is eroded when judges who rule against the government are dismissed as political hacks when journalists who report the truth are deemed enemies of the people and any investigation of corruption is labeled a witch hunt it will be further undermined when a president who has done all of these things is acquitted and vindicated by a deeply partisan and feckless senate majority deterioration in the rule of law reckless fiscal policy and lack of public investment failure to fix a costly and underperforming health care system or address the challenges of globalization and climate change like the impeachment process now playing out at the capitol each is both a consequence of and contributor to our broken politics and like the impeachment process each will have negative long term impact on the quality of our institutions and the vibrancy of our economy trump impeachment trial begins stocks hit new high if the headline sounds too good to be true that s only because it probably is steven pearlstein a washington post economics columnist and the robinson professor of public affairs at george mason university is the author of can american capitalism survive

by tim mutsekwa greetings one again to you all l hope i find you well and in rude health as we conclude another week striking medics in zimbabwe have agreed to go back to work after billionaire strive masiyiwa offered a 6 25 million fellowship to help ease the doctors welfare in the country junior doctors in the country s public hospitals downed tools in september to protest poor wages which had been worsened by the zimbabwe s economic crisis two months later the senior hospital doctors association shda joined their colleagues saying they could no longer cope with the poor working conditions and the dire state of health facilities in the country masiyiwa through his charity late last year offered to pay doctors a monthly subsistence allowance of roughly 300 doctors are also offered transport to and from work the higherlife foundation charity announced tuesday that it had reopened the offer which more than 300 doctors had signed up for before it closed in december but dr masimba ndoro vice president of the zimbabwe hospital doctors association warned that nothing much has changed in the conditions at public hospitals that include the lack of basic items such as bandages and gloves relatives of patients are still expected to buy such items and in some instances bring buckets of water as zimbabwe s once envied health care system reflects the southern african nation s general collapse zimbabwe s supreme court has ruled that all local debts incurred before 22 february 2019 must be settled in the local currency at a rate of one zimbabwe dollar to one us dollar chief justice luke malaba said the repayments should not involve any conversions upholding a lower court s ruling on the reintroduction of zimbabwean dollars in 2019 chief justice luke malaba made the landmark ruling in an appeal case involving zambezi gas zimbabwe pvt limited against mining services provider n r barber pvt ltd and the sheriff of zimbabwe zambezi gas had appealed against a high court judgment which instructed the gas company to pay a may 2018 debt using the interbank rate and not 1 1 rate which was effected in february 2019 businesses are set to lose millions of dollars as a result of this voodoo ruling adding more torment to the already impoverished economy in the same week the supreme court delivered its landmark judgement retail outlet bhadella wholesalers announced it will be closing down after being in operation for nearly 90 years citing the adverse economic environment when government indicates that it is open for business and that we are an investment destination proponents which are key to an investor are the property rights and protection by the judiciary when one of the arms of the state makes such decisions they can kiss investment goodbye zimbabwe congress of trade unions president peter mutasa described the judgement as theft as well as the final nail on the coffin of the zimbabwean economy we are going to see companies folding especially those that had foreign lines of credit but supplying other local entities these still have to pay back the loans in foreign currency but are forced to accept useless zimbabwean dollars from their debtors as a result we must expect job losses mutasa pointed out while this ruling pleases domestic borrowers it is bad news for those who have external debts pensions will also be seriously eroded as a result of the judgement it is of principal importance that we name and shame zimbabwe s problems in chief and hence forth pinpoint the perpetrator orchestrator and conductor in chief of the struggle of the zimbabwean people it is the party popularly known as zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanu pf on a very basic level zimbabwe is vice gripped by a never ending economic depression monumental levels of widespread poverty negative economic growth zero access to clean water and sanitation chief among our difficulties is degenerative corruption extra ordinary repression and violence we have very high levels of unemployment liquidity problems collapsing infrastructure morbid industry and commerce as well as a really poor healthcare let alone limited access to it the electricity crisis sounds like just one of our smallest snags our government is broke to the point that it can t afford to pay its own workforce the biggest in the country by the way zimbabwe has graduate vendors destitute academics and touting intellectuals i could go on and on since international capital is a coward no one is prepared to risk their money in a tiny overrated economy like zimbabwe whose leaders are in fact giant pillaging marauders whose appetite for corruption and lawlessness makes that of the piranha look like child s play emmerson mnangagwa when capable chief executives join struggling companies they infuse a dose of confidence that in some cases cause the firm s share price to rise for example when steve jobs rejoined apple in 1997 the company was worth 3 billion just over half of zimbabwe s gdp of 5 2 billion the same year but when he died in 2011 the company s value has soared to a world record 624 billion apple s stock price rose more than 9 000 since steve jobs returned in 1997 in the meantime zimbabwe s gdp had grown by only 100 to just over 17 85 billion in 2017 my point here is chief executives and their capabilities matter in growing or killing companies the same way they matter in growing economies to use an african example since uhuru kenyatta took over as kenyan president in 2013 the kenyan economy has added about 20 billion between 2013 and now to its 74 94 billion gdp of 2020 that is an addition of the size of the entire zimbabwean economy in a space of two years when hu jintao took over as paramount leader of china in 2003 the economy grew almost 800 from just 1 2 trillion in 2003 to 8 5 trillion in 2012 when he passed on the button to xi jinping national chief executives therefore matter in changing the course of a country for better or for worse since 2013 zimbabwe has seen a complete reversal of its growth trajectory and shows strong signs of deflation to see how damaging the effect of the negative multiplier to the zimbabwean economy will be here is an illustration the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in zimbabwe are in a near comatose state several banks have collapsed and with them employment deposits and other positive spin offs to the economy since consumers spend less on the high street or on vendors as is the case across zimbabwe towns businesses experience losses or falls in profitability with low demand for their goods or services it makes no economic sense to maintain those workers who are now idling around in a quiet shop therefore this leads us to more retrenchments the only thing that zimbabweans and non zimbabweans agree on is that the country has potential but that potential will never be realized with that level of ineptitude in the highest office in the land mnangagwa seems very small minded and blinded that he can hardly see far from his nose he also seems oblivious to the suffering around him as the chief executive of zimbabwe mnangagwa s ineptitude in matters economic is now the stuff of legend there is no bailout coming from china the chinese are not idiots they learnt decades ago from deng that no matter if it is a white cat or a black cat as long as it can catch mice it is a good cat but then the zimbabwean cat will not catch mice for them so it s not a good cat they the chinese also learnt from their mistake in south sudan which is costing them a lot in protecting their investments in that country no one trusts mnangagwa he flip flops on policies today he may be for foreign investors and tomorrow he is chasing them away for political expediency because he thinks a president owns the country he surrounds himself with an equally incompetent coterie of bootlickers who have no record of performance he could not get a bailout from south africa he won t get one from china he won t get any from africa either so buckle up with mnangagwa at the helm brace for a worse 2020 hope that mnangagwa will fight corruption thieves are rarely gracious enough to return their loot the logic is simple if they had grace no pun intended they would not have stolen in the first place zimbabwe has become a mini version of nigeria with a generous mix of both grandiose corruption at high levels and petty bribery at the lower levels of society the police shamelessly set up road blocks at 10 km intervals across town and highways engaging in mass scale shakedowns ruling party scoundrels go around town like warlords in somalia taking over bus termini hijacking city council buildings and collecting rent and protection fees as well as collecting rentals from desperate street vendors but there is a catch if you want to be corrupt in zimbabwe and get away with it just mention that whatever you are doing has the blessing of the godfather mnangagwa is the al scarface capone of zimbabwe he is the joaquin el chapo guzmán of our troubled southern african country albeit a better one because he is a sitting president and will never have trouble from the law because he is the law mnangagwa has been involved in sleazy stuff within and outside zimbabwe in the drc equatorial guinea etc and has allowed his subordinates just as much slack so if you think that emmerson mnangagwa will fight corruption you are no better than someone riding a dead horse strategizing about how to lower the standards so that more dead horses can also be included the best you can do is dismount this dead horse and think about how to clean zimbabwe up and drive the joaquin el chapo guzmán of zimbabwe out of office a second hand economy with archaic infrastructure in addition to a trade deficit culminating in a current account deficit importing more than you export zimbabwe s economy is a costly economy with painful inefficiencies and unbelievable red tape businesses and individuals for example run mostly on second hand cars imported mostly from japan this means that the economy has to grapple with further imports of car parts to keep them running the roads are in scary state of disrepair causing further damage to the second hand cars companies are operating on archaic technology plant and equipment which makes their products uncompetitive there is also an explosion of the trade of second hand clothes from abroad killing domestic production power plants all of them built by the colonial regime are also now so old that they frequently break down during its decades in power zanu pf did not build a single power plant leaving the country in a perpetual power deficit this deficit will get worse for the country as more and more power consumers fail to pay their bills affecting the country s ability to import power from neighbours creating another domino effect that affects the whole economy banana republic it s common in harare to see youths across town with push carts full of bananas poor corrupt politically wobbly agrarian and largely dependent on the export of a few resources zimbabwe now generally meets most people s definition of a banana republic american author william porter who coined the term banana republic used the phrase to depict a country with a huge but impoverished working class presided upon by a small ruling elite made up of political business and military class the ruling class is interconnected with one influencing feeding and operating the other but more importantly controlling the primary sector the economy is dependent upon zimbabwe among other countries is one of the countries that evolved from colonialism and chose a rotten path towards becoming a banana republic hope of improvement in our lifetime a better future life is possible for the zimbabwean generation born in the last ten years they have a fair chance of seeing a good zimbabwe in their lifetime but for anybody born after 1980 and before the year 2005 a good lifestyle for the generality of the population is a mirage the majority of the university graduates in zimbabwe today will not get employment in their prime years which means that they miss out on gaining critical formal skills necessary for a productive economy some will cross borders to go and labor in foreign lands if you want to see why a month can easily turn into a year and a year into decades while your life is wasting away with your chances to change the world fading away into the horizon here is the evidence a few people in zanu pf saw that mugabe was a risk to the nation more than a decade ago the late army general vitalis zvinavashe through proxies approached morgan tsvangirai to arrange what would have been zimbabwe s first government of national unity way back in 2002 the late army general according to reports at the time was working with emmerson mnangagwa on this plan because they realized that robert mugabe is the main stumbling block they said mugabe must step down before we can find solutions to our economic decline and the hunger among many other problems tsvangirai said at the time mugabe did stand down but mnangagwa is still there eighteen years later he is still a stumbling block and will remain one true to zvinavashe s view it is now mnangagwa who has to step down before zimbabwe can find solutions to its economic quagmire hunger has increased more people have since died from archaic diseases since 2018 more children have dropped out of school a whole generation is ruined and generally everybody in zimbabwe is now more impoverished than back then while we are at it emmerson mnangagwa has declared his interest covertly and overtly to run for president of zimbabwe in 2023 so before you think your woes will soon be over hang on and buckle your seatbelt for that reason international capital will skirt zimbabwe and go to other countries with a better value proposition because international capital is a coward increased emigration and xenophobia risk zimbabwe s neighbouring countries need to brace for a further influx of economic refugees running away from zimbabwe s catastrophic economic failure in the same vein the region needs to prepare for and work to prevent further xenophobia in the same vein zimbabweans scattered in many countries across the world mainly in the uk and south africa must prepare themselves to feed and take care of their folks back home as things stand zimbabwe is a lost nation with a lost agenda with hardships eating the national conscience away never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity all zimbabweans squandered an opportunity to change course the country s collective intellectual capital is frittered away with some of its graduates labouring as waiters and farm workers in neighbouring countries conclusion as long as emmerson mnangagwa is where he is there is little if any hope for the present generation in zimbabwe hoping for the best when reality shows otherwise is tantamount to riding a dead horse and the best strategy when you are riding a dead horse is to dismount how you dismount is up to you it is not the west that is the enemy or sanctions the opposition gays or the absence of mbuya nehanda s bones zanu pf is the enemy of the people and whatever effect external white capital interests have had on the nation all that stands like a pea next to a mountain when compared to the determination of the revolution to kill us off and our dreams too all this while they live lavish lifestyles in the brooke zanu pf the once upon a time embodiment of african renaissance has become the paragon of heartbreak circus and monumental pettiness the personification of corruption racism homophobia greed grand theft and tsotsi ocracy 40 years after independence zimbabwe regrettably threatens to become the greatest tragedy since weimar germany the nation has traversed the line from breadbasket to basket case from model state to banana republic the euphoria that gripped millions on independence day in 1980 has been replaced by frantic incessant despair as things stand the revolution is lifeless betrayed trampled over and done the revolution lies crumbled destroyed and deathly at the soles of our feet right next to our dying bodies dead by its hand tim mutsekwa

earlier today we outlined the one big reason that traders may still be underestimating the risks from coronavirus noting that at its current growth clip coronavirus could exceed the sars infection figures by wednesday and more than double them by friday while time will tell if and when authorities are ultimately able to contain the outbreak traders are already starting to position for an adverse scenario below we highlight eight markets that are already moving in response to the coronavirus epidemic 1 gold the world s ultimate safe haven asset is fulfilling its normal role during times of uncertainty with the yellow metal trading about 0 5 higher as of writing and on track for its highest close since 2013 2 oil both major oil contracts are falling by about 2 on the day to hit their lowest levels in nearly 3 months obviously any contraction in economic activity could decrease demand for petroleum which is also plagued by oversupply issues despite production cuts from opec 3 safe haven and risk sensitive currencies as my colleague joe perry noted earlier today the risk off move is driving traders out of growth sensitive major currencies such as the australian and new zealand dollars and into perceived safe haven currencies including the japanese yen and swiss franc as such crosses like aud jpy and nzd jpy may be particularly vulnerable among the g10 currencies with emerging asian currencies like the singapore dollar indian rupee thai bhat and russian ruble potentially seeing spillover volatility 4 emerging markets in addition to china many emerging market funds have heavy exposure to other fast growing countries in southeast asia that could be hit disproportionately hard by further limitations to travel and commerce to take just one prominent example the 31b ishares emerging markets etf eem is trading off by 3 on the day 5 consumer companies with substantial business in china analysts have noted that the untimely closure of shanghai disneyland and many theatres across the country could impact walt disney company dis 2 similarly starbucks sbux 3 has closed all of its stores in the wuhan and hubei provinces in more traditional consumer goods nike nke 2 derives more than 6b in revenue from greater china and could be particularly vulnerable following last year s tensions surrounding the nba 6 airline stocks fearing the potential negative impact on travel and tourism traders are selling airline stocks aggressively among the three major us airlines each of delta dal 3 american aal 5 and united airlines ual 5 are shedding more than 3 on the day chinese based airlines like china eastern cea and china southern airlines znh have sold off by 7 as of writing 7 other travel related stocks beyond the airlines traders fear that a continued outbreak could hurt other travel related companies hotel operators like marriott international mar 1 hyatt hotels h 0 5 hilton worldwide hlt 3 are all falling as are cruise lines like carnival corporation ccl 4 royal caribbean rcl 7 and norwegian cruise lines nclh 3 8 medical safety equipment stocks of course the outbreak will also create a number of short term winners primarily among firms producing safety equipment for medical workers and other citizens names in that space include alpha pro tech apt 19 a mask manufacturer and lakeland industries lake 10 which creates protective clothes for high risk workers source tradingview gain capital please note that these instruments may not be available in all regions

predicted 7 million outbound trips for chinese new year this year up from 6 3 million in 2019 anti government protests in hong kong have left many from the chinese mainland wary of visiting that popular destination and more likely to travel farther afield the same goes for the self governed island of taiwan where heavy voter turnout in elections earlier this month favoured candidates who do not favour uniting with beijing as china s leaders insist must happen eventually chinese made about 134 million trips in 2019 according to official figures up 4 5 per cent from a year earlier but a

at this rate the prime minister s vision for pakistan is looking more like a list of red flags travelling amongst the procession of jets and limousines to the alpine town last week was imran khan over four days the prime minister delivered a key address was interviewed by several media platforms and engaged in a bilateral discussion with his united states us counterpart donald trump khan sought to present his vision for pakistan and davos seemed the perfect place to do just that beyond its reputation as a dangerous country in an unstable region pakistan remains relatively unknown to the rest of the world but the last few years have seen a marked shift in in a number of areas domestic terrorism has considerably declined the tourism industry has received a decent boost and since coming to power khan has enhanced the country s diplomacy by highlighting its strategic role in regional conflict mediation so how did the prime minister fare in front of one of the largest congregations of leading businesses khan s unscripted yet articulate speaking style was praised by commentators the earnestness with which he spoke about pakistan conveyed pride for what has so far been achieved but also an awareness for the obstacles that prevent it from becoming an islamic welfare state indeed after an international monetary fund imf bailout and foreign loan packages pakistan s economy has somewhat stabilised but as the rupee continues to suffer revenue streams dry out and debt and inflation rates rise the road to economic growth remains long and arduous macroeconomic instability and years of mismanagement have dominated pakistan s recent history made infinitely worse by an inherently weak national tax collection system and corruption that has permeated across all strata of the state piecemeal reforms such as 2018 s populist driven austerity programme have failed to deliver substantial results not least because the military retains huge chunks of non development expenditure and maintains its influence over the government s fiscal policies it is no wonder that potential investors are dubious when asked whether the country is in the throes of debt entrapment with china the prime minister dismissed any notion that the china pakistan economic corridor cpec has exacerbated pakistan s debt crisis instead attributing the doubling of foreign direct investment fdi within a year to the chinese however cpec has generated concerns among the international community in large part due to its lack of transparency and the prospect of china s increased territorial control in pakistan the case of sri lanka s hambantota port confirmed that china does not do anything for free and ultimately comes out winning even if the debtor state defaults on its loans as the trade deficit grows and local economies get dismantled under projects like gwadar s port park city it is likely that pakistan will become yet another victim of china s debt trap diplomacy the sad state of pakistan s economy simply reveals its age old problem of deeply entrenched reliance on neighbours and powerful allies for support this was evident at davos in khan s unwillingness to criticise china s brutal treatment of the uighurs instead suggesting that muslims in kashmir and myanmar are facing worse khan s admission that he cannot publicly go against china since it helped pakistan when it was at rock bottom was helpfully candid but it also undermines his call to unify the muslim ummah at the united nations general assembly unga meeting last year so throughout his performance at davos one could not help but wonder did khan s charisma belie the bleakness of pakistan s trajectory and does pakistan wield any real influence in regional politics if one thing stood out from khan s trip it was showcasing pakistan s ability to remain friendly with an array of actors such as saudi arabia iran the united states and china trump s apparent enthusiasm to help mediate in the kashmir crisis shows a distinct improvement in pakistan us relations over the last year however india s repeated rejection of any such proposal means that trump s words don t mean much and if anything look more like lip service in return for pakistan s assistance in the afghan peace talks similarly khan s adamant refusal to get involved in any possible conflict between the us and iran is unlikely to deter either party from escalating the conflict whether pakistan s recent popularity is merely a smokescreen for darker underlying trends or a forecast for positive change will be subject to continuous debate at this rate the prime minister s vision for pakistan is looking more like a list of red flags

earnings per share grew to 5 35 in 2019 compared to 4 97 in 2018 driven primarily by higher adjusted operating income lower interest expense and higher income from unconsolidated operations this resulted in an 8 increase in adjusted earnings per share which includes an unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates the company continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached a record 947 million in 2019 an increase from 821 million in 2018 the strong operating cash flow was mainly driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements as the company continues to focus on paying down debt a portion of this cash was used to pay down 436 million of acquisition debt the company ended the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 3 4x fiscal year 2020 financial outlook mccormick expects continued global growth in consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating mccormick is aligned with consumers increased interest in bolder flavors demand for convenience focus on fresh natural ingredients and transparency around the sourcing and quality of food as well as the need to know about the environmental and social impacts behind the brands they buy through its growth strategies the company is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand and drive sales of its broad flavor portfolio through brand marketing new products and expanded distribution the company is continuing to drive sales growth balanced with its focus on lowering costs to sustainably realize long term earnings growth the company expects minimal impact from currency rates in 2020 on net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share in 2020 the company expects to grow sales compared to 2019 by 2 to 4 this increase consists entirely of organic growth as the company has no incremental sales impact from acquisitions in 2020 the company expects to drive sales growth with new products brand marketing and expanded distribution sales growth is also expected to include the impact of pricing which in conjunction with cost savings is expected to offset anticipated mid single digit inflationary pressures the company has plans to achieve approximately 105 million of cost savings and intends to use these savings to improve margins fund investments to drive continued growth and as a further offset to increased costs the company expects strong underlying business performance driven by sales growth will continue in 2020 which will be more than offset by a significant incremental investment associated with business transformation and a higher projected effective tax rate excluding this investment and tax headwind mccormick s growth from the underlying operating performance is expected to be strong and in line with its long term organic growth objectives operating income in 2020 is expected to range from comparable to an increase of 2 from 958 million of operating income in 2019 the company projects that the incremental expenses in 2020 associated with its business transformation investment will reduce growth in operating income by approximately 6 in addition approximately 8 million of special charges are currently projected for 2020 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions excluding the impact of special charges in 2020 and 2019 adjusted operating income is projected to be comparable to adjusted operating income of 979 million in 2019 within an expected range from a 1 decline to a 1 increase this expected range includes projected strong underlying base business growth of 5 to 7 substantially offset by the 6 business transformation investment impact mccormick projects 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of 5 15 to 5 25 compared to 5 24 of earnings per share in 2019 the company s projected earnings per share growth from its strong underlying business performance is more than offset by 2020 incremental business transformation expenses estimated to be a 7 reduction in growth and a 3 headwind from an expected increase in the projected effective tax rate to approximately 22 excluding an estimated 0 05 impact of special charges in 2020 the company projects 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of 5 20 to 5 30 which is an expected decline of 3 to a decline of 1 for fiscal year 2020 the company

associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up front costs and organizational structural impact to require advance approval by our management committee upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs expected benefits and expected timing to the management committee and the committee s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on going basis through completion transaction and integration expenses consist of expenses associated with the acquisition or integration of the rb foods business these costs primarily consist of outside advisory service and consulting costs employee related costs and other costs related to the acquisition we incurred these costs in 2018 income taxes associated with the enactment of the u s tax act in december 2017 consists of a net income tax expense benefit of 6 7 million and 301 5 million recognized during the three months and year ended november 30 2018

with the one time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non u s subsidiaries we recorded an additional net income tax benefit of 1 5 million during the year ended november 30 2019 associated with a provision to return adjustment related to the u s tax act we believe that these non gaap financial measures are important the exclusion of the items noted above provides additional

management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends these non gaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of

fourth quarter of 2019 key takeaways from the call today are we reported record net income for 2019 of 172 million excluding merger related costs key credit quality metrics remained at low levels we successfully consummated our merger with old line bancshares and are excited about our opportunities in the mid atlantic market it s important to note that 75 of our projected cost saves will not begin to be realized until after the systems conversion that will occur at the end of the first quarter of 2020 since 2009 we have grown from 5 billion to nearly 16 billion in total assets while generating positive operating leverage that lowered our efficiency ratio approximately 750 basis points to 56 7 during 2019 we accomplished this tripling in size by expanding from three to six states expanding the midwest the mid south and now the mid atlantic with substantial deposit market shares while maintaining balanced loan and deposit distribution across this diverse regional footprint this geographic expansion was done methodically with a critical focus on shareholder return during the last four years we have moved into two fast growing regions the louisville lexington corridor in kentucky and the baltimore washington d c corridor in maryland in fact we have expanded many of our revenue generating functions into diversified major markets with growing populations and positive demographics while keeping the majority of our back office and support staffs based in our wheeling headquarters we have focused on developing and expanding our earnings streams through the diversifying of our loan portfolio and enhancing of our fee related businesses commercial and industrial loans have increased nearly 260 to represent 16 of loans as compared to 13 10 years ago through a combination of acquisitions entering major markets hiring excellent teams and developing a full suite of commercial products we now provide our commercial customers the services they need to effectively and efficiently run their organizations including loan swaps money management treasury management investment and retirement and foreign exchange services in addition we have made significant investments in our fee based businesses where we have added securities brokerage license banking services and we developed private banking services as well which is growing at a 40 compound annual growth rate since being launched in 2013 we ve grown our residential mortgage lending program and capabilities which has allowed mortgage banking volume to increase three fold over the last few years that we are focused on taking advantage of new markets and added talented mortgage origination officers in order to balance the growth between secondary market loans and portfolio loans we ve invested in scalable technology that meets the needs of our regional franchise as well as the needs of our customers when and how they want those needs met years ago we implemented video conferencing sim client technology and cloud based infrastructure to allow us to operate efficiently and effectively as we ve grown we were one of the first banks to utilize apple and google pay and have enhanced the digital offerings to our customers to include online applications for residential and small business loans online deposit account opening p2p payment capabilities and online budgeting tools our company is evolving and will continue to evolve as we develop new revenue streams into higher growth markets our very recent recognition as the number seven best bank in the country by forbes coupled with our seventh consecutive outstanding cra rating demonstrates our continued commitment to our customers and our communities during this evolution we are proud of our long rich history we re excited about our future opportunities as we continue to transform our institution to meet the needs of our customers with a community bank feel i d now like to turn the call over to bob young our cfo for an update on the fourth quarter s financial results bob robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks todd and good morning to all of you our fourth quarter core earnings performance improved and was above our expectations as execution of our fundamental strategies control deposit costs and expenses and accretion from the old line acquisition drove improved earnings over the third quarter and assisted in our record core net income performance of 159 million for all of 2019 during the fourth quarter we experienced a continued declining rate environment and a relatively flat yield curve although it did improve somewhat later in the quarter the impact of another 25 basis point federal reserve short term interest rate cut in october a pick up in commercial real estate projects being refinanced or sold earlier than expected due to the current rate environment and the full quarter s impact of the mandatory limitation on interchange fees for large banks above 10 billion in total assets for the three months ended december 31 2019 we reported gaap net income of 36 4 million and earnings per diluted share of 0 60 as compared to 43 9 million and 0 80 respectively in the prior year period excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods net income increased 1 to 45 5 million with earnings per diluted share of 0 75 the year over year decrease in earnings per diluted share was primarily due to the additional shares issued for the old line acquisition as well as before our anticipated expense savings in addition for the 12 months ended december 31 2019 we reported gaap net income of 159 million and earnings per diluted share of 2 83 as compared to 143 1 million and 2 92 respectively in the prior year period excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods net income increased 9 3 to 171 8 million with earnings per diluted share of 3 06 financial results for first century and farmers capital have been included in wesbanco s results subsequent to their merger dates of april 5 and august 20 2018 respectively and the financial results for old line have been included in our results since its november 22 2019 merger date total assets as of the end of the year of 15 7 billion increased 26 2 year over year due to the old line acquisition furthermore total portfolio loans of 10 3 billion increased 34 1 while total deposits increased 24 6 to 11 billion compared to the prior year also due to the acquisition total organic loan growth was 1 1 year over year primarily in c i and residential real estate loan categories partially offset by elevated levels of commercial real estate loan payoffs excluding the old line acquisition and certificates of deposit which we continue to allow to run off over time our organic transaction account deposits increased slightly year over year while non interest bearing demand deposits increased 2 2 during the fourth quarter we reduced certain higher cost rates for private banking public funds institutional and repo sweep accounts as well as certain higher cost cd rates in our new and mid atlantic market for loans we realized strong total production during both fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2019 total commercial production of approximately 1 6 billion increased 40 year over year and total residential real estate production increased 34 year over year to approximately 650 million this growth in production was driven by the caliber of our lending teams as well as the continued strength across the diverse economies of our six state footprint both commercial and residential production was higher during the fourth quarter and the same period last year while year end pipelines were also stronger than at year end 2018 at 680 million and 85 million respectively so far new loan production in the mid atlantic market continues at a similar pace to what they have recorded before the acquisition while commercial and industrial lending typically has long sales cycles we are seeing the benefits of the prior investments we have made in the expansion and quality of our commercial industrial lending teams and launching of our online lending application capabilities earlier in 2019 these investments contributed to 5 9 year over year organic growth in our c i lending categories the federal reserve rate cuts during the second half of 2019 have continued to both detract from and benefit our residential real estate loan categories organic home equity lending decreased 1 8 year over year primarily due to the low interest rate environment driving an increase in residential mortgage refinancing as homeowners trade variable rate heloc balances for fixed rate first lien mortgages on the flip side the expansion of our mortgage origination teams has resulted in higher gain on sale income up almost 41 for the year on record production as well as retained loans for the loan portfolio which grew organically 1 9 year over year in addition mortgage refinancing volume which represented about 42 of total fourth quarter production is now nearly 4 times the volume realized during the prior year period application activity to date in our mid atlantic market bodes well for their contribution to 2020 residential mortgage loan growth and gain on sale income as a result of the current rate environment highlighted by three recent federal reserve interest rate cuts we have continued to see a pickup in commercial real estate projects going to the secondary market or selling outright earlier than expected in fact the acceleration we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2019 was almost triple to more normalized quarterly average rate we experienced first half of 2019 and exceeded 200 million in the fourth quarter which negatively impacted total organic fourth quarter loan growth by approximately 2 percentage points we expect the current elevated level of commercial real estate payoffs to continue through at least the first half of 2020 however it could last longer depending upon the interest rate environment despite the headwinds created by the low interest rate environment and aggressive secondary commercial real estate market we do expect to see a return to our normal low to mid single digit total loan growth over the long term due to our new mid atlantic market the strength of our lending teams and the record levels of both our total commercial and residential mortgage pipelines as i previously noted as we are seeing across our industry net interest margins are being negatively impacted by the three cuts of federal reserve s target federal funds rate during the second half of 2019 as well as the relatively flat yield curve reflecting these industrywide headwinds our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 17 basis points year over year to 3 55 but only 1 basis point on a sequential quarter basis the net interest margin for the full year of 2019 was up 10 basis points year over year to 3 62 due to the federal reserve short term rate increases during 2018 the higher margin farmers capital acquired net earning assets and higher purchase accounting accretion for the full year of 19 basis points versus 2018 s 14 basis points excluding such purchase accounting accretion the core margin was 3 43 for all of 2019 as compared to 3 38 in the prior year purchase accounting accretion from the acquisitions benefited the fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 22 basis points as compared to 23 basis points in the prior year period and 13 basis points in the third quarter furthermore the accretion during the fourth quarter of 2019 included 4 basis points of accretion from acquired loan payoffs and approximately 6 basis points from the old line merger excluding purchase accounting accretion we reported a core net interest margin of 3 33 down 16 basis points year over year and 10 basis points on a sequential quarter basis for the quarter ended december 31 2019 non interest income increased 16 1 from the prior year to 30 8 million driven by organic growth and the old line acquisition which accounted for approximately one third of such increase mortgage banking fees increased 1 4 million compared to last year s fourth quarter as noted previously due to growth in residential mortgage origination dollar volume and the associated sale of approximately one half of those originations into the secondary market electronic banking fees decreased 2 3 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting an approximate 2 8 million quarterly impact from the limitation on interchange fees for debit card processing that resulted from the durbin amendment to the 2010 dodd frank act and that was partially offset by higher point of sale and atm transactions other income increased 84 1 during the fourth quarter to 5 8 million due to higher commercial customer loan swap related income net securities gains increased 1 8 million to 0 5 million from a loss in last year s fourth quarter primarily from market adjustments for the company s director and key officer deferred compensation plan the treatment of this adjustment was neutral to operating income as an offsetting 1 1 million was recorded as a credit within employee benefits expense net securities gains for the year also includes a 2 6 million gain in the second quarter of 2019 for the sale of our visa class b share ownership position excluding merger related expenses non interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 11 4 million or 16 4 to 81 million compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the old line acquisition which accounted for approximately 42 of that increase the 16 year over year increase is primarily due to higher salaries and wages employee benefits and occupancy equipment and other operating costs associated with the additional staffing and financial center locations from the old line acquisition in addition salaries and wages reflect the annual mid year merit increases and higher incentive and stock compensation employee benefits of 9 9 million increased 2 6 million quarter over quarter due to a similar 1 1 million reduction in deferred compensation plan obligations as noted in my prior comment about net securities gains as well as higher healthcare expenses of 3 7 million which is partially reflective of the 2018 acquisitions and their impact for the full year of 2019 lastly as mentioned last quarter we recognized fdic insurance credits of approximately 0 7 million during the fourth quarter the efficiency ratio was 58 3 for the quarter reflecting the durbin fee income cut and the inclusion of old line s expenses prior to any associated cost savings credit quality ratios remained strong at year end as we balance disciplined loan origination in the current environment with prudent lending standards as of december 31 2019 both non performing loans and non performing assets as percentages of the portfolio and total assets at 0 49 and 0 35 respectively remained relatively low and consistent for the past several quarters these percentages included approximately 3 8 million of non performing loans and 0 5 million of other real estate loan from old line on a positive note the provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter benefited from approximately 1 1 million associated with the release of the specific reserves assigned to three previously acquired credit impaired loans that paid off during the quarter additionally total net charge offs for the fourth quarter included specific reserves of 2 8 million taken in prior periods for the year net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were low 0 9 as compared to 0 6 in 2018 wesbanco continues to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios as both consolidated and bank level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable well capitalized standards promulgated by bank regulators and basel iii capital standards during the fourth quarter of 2019 our tier 1 leverage and tier 1 risk based capital ratios decreased by approximately 108 basis points and 122 basis points respectively due to the movement of 136 5 million of trust preferred securities from tier 1 to tier 2 risk based capital as required by the dodd frank act for financial institutions with total assets greater than 15 billion also pro forma tier 1 leverage capital would be just below 10 due to period end assets were used in the calculation instead of averages as required on december 19 2019 the board of directors authorized the adoption of a new stock repurchase plan for the purchase on the open market of up to an additional 1 7 million shares of wesbanco common stock representing approximately 2 5 of outstanding shares which is an addition to an existing plan approved in 2015 during the fourth quarter of 2019 we repurchased roughly 255 000 shares of our outstanding common stock at a total cost of 9 5 million and as of year end approximately 2 5 million shares remained for repurchase we currently anticipate that we will continue to repurchase shares during 2020 as permitted by securities laws subject to market conditions and other factors the timing price and quantity of any such potential repurchases will be at wesbanco s discretion well i wouldn t be an accountant if i didn t bring up to date on cecl the current expected credit loss model became effective for wesbanco on january 1 2020 as part of our implementation process we previously disclosed a range of up to a 30 increase in the allowance for loan losses excluding the impact from old line including our fourth quarter of 2019 acquisition of old line in the analysis and subject to purchase accounting adjustments we now expect an increase of approximately 40 to 60 as of january 1 in the allowance for credit losses including loan commitments which represents about a 20 basis point to 25 basis point decline in tier 1 risk based capital is applied on a pro forma basis as of december 31 2019 the ultimate impact of adoption will depend on the finalization of purchase accounting and impaired loans for old line which could impact the estimated initial adoption range also the impact on regulatory capital will be spread over three years as permitted by regulatory actions taken after cecl s initial adoption i would now like to provide some thoughts on our current outlook for 2020 as a slightly asset sensitive bank we are not immune from factors affecting industry margins including a relatively flat spread between the three month and 10 year treasury yields and a continued to overall lower long term rate environment while we continue to believe that our core deposit funding advantage combined with our lower loan to deposit ratio should help control overall deposit funding costs i want to remind you that we did not experience a high deposit beta when rates were moving up during 2018 so our core deposit rates cannot be lowered as much in the current rate environment our gaap or stated net interest margin for 2020 as indicated by our asset liability model may decrease by 2 basis points to 3 basis points per quarter due to lower purchase accounting accretion from a starting point of 20 basis points to 22 basis points during the first quarter of 2020 including the impact of old line s purchase account we are currently anticipating one more federal reserve rate cut of 25 basis points in late june 2020 which if such occurs would cause the margin to decrease by an additional 2 basis points to 4 basis points in the back half of the year depending upon the shape and overall level of the yield curve at that time core margin should otherwise remain relatively flat assuming we can offset any further loan yield reductions with deposit and other funding cost decreases we will continue to focus on expense trends to ensure positive operating leverage while positioning the company for long term growth we expect to achieve the planned 31 old line cost savings during 2021 with approximately 75 realized by the end of 2020 we are planning for systems and branch signage conversions to occur by the end of the first quarter and anticipated cost savings should begin shortly thereafter typical mid year merit increases will be effective across our entire organization and in addition we expect total marketing expenses to increase from 2019 s level reflecting additional marketing spend in our various markets and our approximate 25 larger company size furthermore fdic insurance expense will increase from the levels recorded during the second half of 2019 which reflected the 3 1 million assessment credit we received from the fdic we also anticipate making additional revenue generating hires as we enhance lending and wealth management teams and associated support staff in our new mid atlantic market there is typically a lag between when lending and wealth management personnel are hired and when they begin building a revenue generating book of business we do currently estimate the quarterly reduction during 2020 in electronic banking fee income from the limitation on interchange fees due to the durbin amendment will be relatively consistent with the impact recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019 which will continue to have a slight negative influence on the efficiency ratio as a reminder we will anniversary the impact from the durbin amendment during the third quarter of 2020 we do not anticipate that our credit quality measures will increase significantly in 2020 although due to prior low levels there may be some variability from quarter to quarter but it should remain comparable or slightly better to our peer institutions quarterly loan loss provisions after adoption of cecl will be highly dependent upon forecasted economic assumptions and other model factors such as loan growth by category in term net charge offs and changes to criticized and classified loan losses lastly we anticipate our effective full year tax rate to be approximately 19 to 20 subject to changes in certain taxable income strategies as we have now added in maryland to our state income tax provision todd i ll turn it back to you todd f clossin president and chief executive officer thanks bob before i open the call to your questions i want to provide a brief update on the changes in our internal loan classification methodology as we discussed last quarter as well as bank was grown and transformed into a 16 billion institutions spanning in six states we believe it was important on a go forward basis to heavily weight quantitative measures in our loan risk rating process in particular debt service coverage therefore we initiated a project during 2019 to review and regrade all loans under this revised methodology the shift in factory utilization that s what it was it s not credit deterioration is what drove most of the changes in the loan risk ratings and associated criticized and classified loan levels that we experienced the last few quarters we have now completed the majority of this regrading project we ve gone through all loans greater than 1 million and within criticized and classified as well as two great levels above criticized and this is reflected in our fourth quarter results for the quarter ending december 31 2019 our criticized and classified loan to total loans ratio was 2 17 which included approximately 31 million of criticized and classified loans from old line that declined 7 basis points sequentially from the third quarter and is still favorable when compared to the average of all banks with total assets between 10 billion and 25 billion during the first quarter of 2020 we will apply the same revised methodology to the larger old line ones and going forward we will be utilizing the new methodology during the normal course of business i d like to personally welcome the customers and employees of old line into the wesbanco family in addition to maintaining strong commitment to customer service and community banking i m excited about our opportunities in the mid atlantic market as we work to build on old line s market presence and enhance customer relationships through new and expanded products and services i m thrilled to have the old line employees as part of our new mid atlantic market and i look forward to the longer term benefits of this merger we celebrate our 150th anniversary this year as an emerging regional financial institution ready to compete not only in the midwest but also in the mid south and the mid atlantic markets we have the markets the employees the products and the infrastructure to continue our evolution as a company now ready to take your questions rocco would you please review the instructions questions and answers operator yes sir we will now begin the question and answer session today s first question comes from casey whitman of piper sandler please go ahead casey whitman piper sandler analyst good morning todd f clossin president and chief executive officer good morning casey casey whitman piper sandler analyst first question i just wanted to touch on the swap income you guys got this quarter was that higher volume just a function of demand this quarter or was just something else at play and then just what do you think about the sustainability of those fees todd f clossin president and chief executive officer it s all driven by obviously the shape of the yield curve and there is a lot of demand out there on the part of customers so it is a little bit bumpy quarter to quarter based upon the size of loans and whether it s swap or a variable rate or fixed rate or whatever the case might be but we have been seeing some nice trends with that and we re just introducing it into the mid atlantic market now actually it was out on calls last week with some of their lenders and some of their borrowers are utilizing swaps but that s not something that old line has offered in the past so we think we ve got some opportunity there as well but it is going to move around a lot based upon the shape of the yield curve right now it s in a pretty positive area robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer there also was a positive fair value adjustment associated with the existing book of swaps in addition to the higher fees for the quarter as compared to the prior quarter casey casey whitman piper sandler analyst how big was that bob the fair value adjustment robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer it was 500 000 so and that was a negative adjustment in the third quarter due to the yield curve shape at that time casey whitman piper sandler analyst got it thank you and then bob maybe help us out a little bit with the expenses so the growth this quarter was maybe a little more than i was thinking and as you mentioned you got the fdic expense some marketing expenses annual merit increases i guess how should we think about a good range for the quarterly run rate for expenses once we ve got the majority of the old line cost saves realized so as we look at like the back half of 2020 or maybe if you don t want to give a range just how should we think about maybe where the efficiency ratio kind of lands then robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer well we ve given prior guidance on the efficiency ratio being above the historical rate because of durbin and i think with the margin being down last year there is some adjustment to the efficiency ratio there as well so i think that fourth quarter run rate for the efficiency ratio until we begin getting our cost savings is good for now as we start the new year in terms of dollars we spent some time analyzing both the third quarter run rate as well as the fourth quarter run rate and as is my want i made some adjustments that you could either agree with or not but we had i called out the deferred comp adjustment which was different in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter i think we were showing additional marketing expense in the fourth quarter that s probably going to run rate higher as compared to the total 2018 and so the amount you see there in the fourth quarter is probably a fair run rate maybe a little bit less for 2020 as we did advance some customer surveys and market research work in the fourth quarter so that s item two and then additional incentive comp we adjust in the fourth quarter as we re going to provide an adjustment for our non officer employees this quarter and so when you add all those items off and then you do a difference calculation on the fdic we come up with somewhere around 74 million in the fourth quarter for our own expenses and old line has been relatively consistent at around 14 million 14 5 million for the last two to three quarters and so that basically puts you at a 88 million to 88 5 million and then you grow it from there in the new year with higher accruals and payroll taxes in the first quarter adjust for the day count and a couple of other minor savings and so you kind of start the year just under 90 million you get some cost savings beginning in the second quarter and as we have typically said in the past and as i ve guided in the script the second quarter is when we start our annual officer increases with the non exempt then following in the third quarter so there is that run rate difference as we proceed through the year and so you re starting the year at around 89 million to 90 million and are consistent with that in the second quarter adjusted for the day count and then the third and the fourth quarters are slightly higher because of those aforementioned merit increases for the teams i don t know if that s helpful or not casey whitman piper sandler analyst no it is sorry in the second quarter you should see a slight decline though from the cost saves coming in from the 89 million or so in the first quarter correct robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right you could see a slight decline in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter run rate but you do have an extra day in the second quarter as compared to the first even with leap year in the first so and as mentioned the salary increases start basically the middle of may for the officers so there s half the quarter casey whitman piper sandler analyst okay very helpful i ll let someone else jump on thank you robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator and our next question today comes from brody preston of stephens inc please go ahead brody preston stephens inc analyst good morning everyone how are you todd f clossin president and chief executive officer good morning brody brody preston stephens inc analyst hey bob i just want to follow up on the expenses real quick i guess just taking all your comments that you just provided casey it sounds like all in we should expect expenses to sort of bounce around between 88 million to 90 million per quarter through 2020 is that fair robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah a little bit higher in the back half of the year but i do have 75 of cost savings in by the end of the year so that number has to get there that number has been decreased by a total of about 13 million of cost savings related to old line and then the rest of it would be in 2021 brody preston stephens inc analyst okay so i guess as i think about the run rate heading into 2021 is it i guess that s above or below 88 million per quarter robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer at 21 brody preston stephens inc analyst yeah heading into 21 robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer so i haven t i don t have that in front of me but i have in the second half this year between 91 million and 92 million after typical mid year salary increases and stock compensation awards brody preston stephens inc analyst okay all right thank you very much for that robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer and then i guided to the higher marketing for the 2021 year and you ve got to put in a normal run rate on fdic insurance for the year as well that s the guidance i m just reemphasizing those two factors as being different from 2019 brody preston stephens inc analyst okay robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer i guess i m telling you that for 20 but that s run rate for 21 brody preston stephens inc analyst right okay i guess just real quick on the loan book could you remind us what percent of the loan portfolio is tied to one month libor and what percentage is tied to prime robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer the loan book is this is all our loan book i don t have old line share i can tell you old line s is primarily fixed rate and so it will reduce our asset sensitivity we just don t have the books combined yet on an instrument by instrument level so bear with me but 30 of our portfolio commercial portfolio is fixed and 70 is variable and of the variable 48 reprices less than three months and so that s a proxy for both prime and libor adjustment brody preston stephens inc analyst okay all right robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer okay brody preston stephens inc analyst yeah robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer i can give you the whole book but i think you are primarily interested in the commercial brody preston stephens inc analyst yeah that s right i guess as i look at the loan yield this quarter 4 75 and think about the run rate moving forward just wanted to get a sense for what new origination yields were across the footprint robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer so we have loans over the course of the year loans paid off at a 4 97 rate new loans came on at 4 33 so that gives you some idea where we ended up the year brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then just thinking about the cd book cd costs were down a little bit more than what i would have expected just given the higher cost nature of the old line portfolio i just wanted to get a sense for what drove that and what current offerings are in legacy markets and in the newly acquired old line markets todd f clossin president and chief executive officer yeah i ll start and bob can add to that as well but part of what we re doing is kind of managing the loan to deposit ratio with the deposit flow right so we re about 93 93 3 at the end of the year on the deposit ratio so we still got a little bit of room to grow at the end of the year two of a pretty robust loan growth which hopefully we re going to get out of our legacy footprint in our acquisitions here in the next couple of years and our low to mid single digit loan growth if we did that and didn t significantly grow deposits that start pushing the mid to upper mid loan to deposit ratio what we re seeing so far is in the old line book we want to make sure that we re taking care of some of the strategic customers that they ve got as well too but overall we re not offering the kind of deposit rates that were being offered prior to the acquisition on cds so that is starting to have an impact i don t know what that s going to do volume wise but it will start having an impact on the margin to some degree as bob has talked about previously so we re going to watch it on a monthly basis and one of nice things we have with our legacy footprint because of so deposit rich and we haven t had to do a whole lot to try to generate deposits there as i go a couple of years out and need to raise deposits we can do so in our legacy footprint i think fairly easily without having to do at a high cost markets to raise deposits because we ve got still some relatively low cost deposit markets that we can use to raise deposits to continue to fund the bank long term so we are reducing cd rates in the mid atlantic market across the board that means selective with regard to some key customers brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then as i think about cd growth moving forward sort of taking your comments about being cognizant of the loan to deposit ratio and thinking about the run off of some of those higher cost mid atlantic cds how do you sort of what s the outlook for cd growth as we head forward into 2020 is it flattish or do you expect to see some low single digit growth in that portfolio todd f clossin president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question we ve been able to hold off trying to i guess i d say stabilize or grow the cd book because we haven t had to there will be a date and time where we will probably need to do that although we ll continue to focus on growing demand deposits and still 50 of our book post merger is demand deposits we realize that at some point we may need to raise some cd rates in order to fund our loan growth one of the interesting things about doing that is it s when you go into some of our legacy footprint and you go out there with a higher cd rate you re going to price a lot of your existing book and your existing deposits that aren t in cds so it s not a matter of raising deposit rates a little bit on the cd side it cost you more on the interest rates for the interest expense it will cost you more than just the amount of the increase in the cd rate because again you re going to cannibalize some existing deposits that are going to start rolling into that so that s why we ve kind of resisted it and used federal home loan bank a little bit more even though some of the cd rates might be a little bit lower at times then you d be able to get from the federal home loan bank federal home loan bank you don t have to reprice a big chunk of your book by changing your interest rates you re going to change your interest rates on deposits again you risk cannibalizing your existing book so we re going to kind of balance that based upon the loan to deposit ratio and i would say once we get to mid to upper 90s on the loan to deposit ratio then i think we re going to start getting more aggressive on the cd side and we ll pick the markets we want to do that in the markets where i think we can generate a lot of deposit growth without maybe having a significant market share in that market that way then we can attract deposits in but not reprice the book in that market brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then one last question from me it s a bit of a two prior but the day one cecl update bob just wanted to ask is it fair to say that the delta between the 3q guidance and the 4q guidance is due primarily to include an old line in the analysis robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s exactly what it is i ve done some analysis on there and yet what you have to keep in mind is that they re coming on with a zero reserve so because in purchase accounting we re eliminating there basically 8 million to 9 million existing allowance so you re starting from scratch if you will and the bulk of their loans are the good book clients so there is a doubling up impact there between the credit mark of about 1 and the initial allowance so there is about a 17 million addition to our guidance at the end of the third quarter the increase for wesbanco alone is about little bit less than 10 million and the increase for old line is about 17 million and yet when i m done with that reflecting the quality of the old line portfolio they re coming on at basically 71 basis points while our number would be 81 basis points so the delta is just because of old line and because you re starting from zero there as opposed to having an existing 52 million reserve at legacy wesbanco is that helpful brody preston stephens inc analyst yeah that s helpful as i think about the entirety the entire company though it sounds like 7 million is a bit of a true up from a credit mark perspective and shifting it to the reserve bucket but just with the other acquisitions just wanted to get a sense for what the total dollar amount was in that increase in the reserve that was coming from credit marks versus an originated perspective robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer well the bulk of the increase in wesbanco only which is as i said between 8 million and 10 million is all due to prior acquisitions where you don t have there is only about 4 million of that 52 million related to prior reserves or prior acquisitions and those are just reserves that have been booked after the acquisition on those loans so you re adding between 8 million and 10 million it s actually a reduction in legacy wesbanco i don t have that memorized and an increase in the five or so prior acquisitions in the last few years that we ve done prior to old line and you could probably think about that the total amount again for wesbanco is 8 million to 10 million all of that is related to prior deals but because it s a negative amount for legacy wesbanco and a slightly higher amount for the acquisition it s probably more like of that let s call it 10 million be more like 15 million for the prior acquisitions and minus 5 million for legacy wesbanco that s probably throwing around too many numbers but the thought is similar to old line in that what you re adding for cecl is related to the good book of the acquired acquisitions that basically don t have any significant reserves that have been built up since their acquisition date operator and today s next question comes from catherine mealor of kbw please go ahead catherine mealor kbw analyst thanks good morning robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning catherine mealor kbw analyst all right i don t mean to beat a dead horse but i just wanted to circle back to the expense guidance to make sure i m thinking about this right so we re coming into this quarter excluding old line at about a 74 million expense base robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer right catherine mealor kbw analyst and then old line has about 14 5 pre cost savings and so then if we assume and remind me old line had about 30 cost savings is that right robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer right that s what we spent yeah catherine mealor kbw analyst okay so then if i do 30 of that 14 5 and then only realized 75 of that maybe let s just say by the end of this year then on adding about 11 4 million to that 74 million base which gets me to about 85 million so why would we not be ending the year at about an 85 million quarterly expense run rate versus the 88 million to 90 million that you mentioned robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer well absent to any core efficiencies on the wesbanco side which we ll have what i was guiding to was the earlier changes you have in the 74 million run rate you ll have higher fdic insurance next year then the run rate in the third and fourth quarters excluding the credits right just based upon the higher size the organization and risk factor changes in the calculation and you ll have the mid year salary increases that typically for us are in the 3 to 3 5 range plus stock compensation those are the major changes that would increase the core growth rate higher as we proceed through the year catherine and there s about as i said about 13 million of cost savings factored into my model to get to that run rate on a quarterly basis catherine mealor kbw analyst okay so the 85 million is too low so we really need to keep you re saying if we need to keep operating expenses in the high 80s then for the full year we ve got expenses in like the 350 million range which would is about 10 million to 12 million higher than where our consensus is right now does that feel right robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer it does to me i m not saying consensus is right or wrong i m just saying this is what our build is catherine mealor kbw analyst okay all right so sort of what was dry so you started 19 at an expense range of kind of more in the 71 72 range just from a core basis what s been driving maybe the underlying growth higher than perhaps we expected have there been more higher than it was appreciated or regulatory kind of cost robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer certainly as you go over 10 billion there are higher regulatory costs we ve been building risk management bsa aml and other compliance related teams of individuals to meet regulatory expectations but as i hinted as well in my script related to mid atlantic market we would have done this in kentucky in 2019 adding revenue producers they take a while to produce bottom line net income so that would be the wealth management staff that we ve hired in some additional commercial lenders catherine mealor kbw analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe circling back on the margin i think as we were thinking about old line coming on a core basis let s just strip out accretable yield but as we bring on old line i think we had thought about old line being nim enhancing just given their asset sensitive and the ability to maybe bring down some of their deposit cost so has anything changed since then or do you still believe that there is upside to the core margin as you kind of put these two balance sheets together and realize some those enhancements robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer so there was actually 1 basis point or 2 basis point of core margin expansion in the month of december which with the model as well showing that the first quarter starts us off a couple of bops higher and then drifts from there catherine so first of all lot of loan accretion will come down slowly over three to four year timeframe the cd accretion comes down very fast in fact there will be a significant portion of that recognized in the first half of the year and more than 50 of the total accretion recognized by the end of the year so that purchase accounting number which starts the year at 22 basis points is expected to end the year at 14 basis points we re also experiencing lower accretion from the prior acquisitions they re down on the core a couple of basis points here to start the new year i m sorry they re down relative to purchase accounting i shouldn t confuse the word core with that but they re down a couple of basis points the prior acquisitions are catherine mealor kbw analyst okay but just all else equal you think a more stable core margin in the low 3 30 is appropriate robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer yes without a back if you we have one cut in in mid year so that produces a reduction in our model but if you don t believe kbw has one cut as well but if you don t think that then the stable core margin is what i said in my comments and reaffirm and that s the 3 30s yeah catherine mealor kbw analyst all right great thank you operator our next question today comes from steve moss at b riley fbr please go ahead steve moss b riley fbr analyst good morning guys robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning steve steve moss b riley fbr analyst just one thing on the margin here in particular just on the federal home loan bank borrowing costs they seemed a little bit high for the quarter to me and i was just wondering when does that reprice lower robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer well our 1 4 billion in advances two thirds of that reprices in 2020 there are still are some 220s 240s in there of one year or less as well as some 18 month and two year cds that will reprice this year that s factored into our model currently and so that you just take a look here the federal home loan bank should come down next year as we proceed through the year starting the year in the low 220s and ending up the year just under 2 is that i don t sure if you re looking at the total interest expense which is influenced by volume in addition to rate or you just request steve moss b riley fbr analyst just the average balance sheet with the 243 rate caught my eye so that s where i was going so that was helpful bob and then in terms of the buyback here tangible capital around call it 10 i m just wondering any updated thoughts on targeted capital your appetite for the buyback here i mean obviously i hear subject to market conditions but kind of curious for a little more color todd f clossin president and chief executive officer yeah historically we ve kind of used our capital for acquisitions dividends and buybacks obviously with old line and some of the prior acquisitions we want to stimulate those 2020 is all about old line so when you look at kind of the acquisition piece of that being a couple of years out that really heightens the other uses of capital because we are building capital fairly fairly quickly so that at least the buybacks and the dividend so with 2 5 million shares left remaining in i guess our total in terms of authorizations we are going to be continuing to utilize that opportunistically as we feel needed but it s not something we ve done a lot here over the last few years but given the capital position and the fact that we re on the sidelines for m a perspective for a little bit we think that s an appropriate use which is why we got the authorization increased steve moss b riley fbr analyst so in terms of just thinking about that tangible common equity ratio do you think it s more likely to head toward 9 9 5 or keep it steady around 10 as we think about throughout the year here robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would tend to say i said a couple of years ago i was happy in kind of the mid 8s but i would tell you that in 9 to 10 in that range because we are continuing to build it but offsetting that will be will be the buyback so you will obviously 9 to 10 steve moss b riley fbr analyst okay that s helpful and then just on the i mean credit was good but in terms of the charge offs for a specific reserve loans just wondering what types of loans were charged off and any color you can give there robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer well they re all from prior acquisitions one is in the nursing home business and they re basically commercial real estate not c i todd f clossin president and chief executive officer and there were three during the quarter and again it s interesting because you get your own questions tenant working through when you see questions around an increase in charge offs 20 basis points we ve been a lot lower than that the key important thing to remember here is that these were already had specific reserves right so the charge off amount was already identified and reserved for so that s why you had to the release but the charge off number being these weren t surprises the dollar amount wasn t surprising i kind of don t like the fact that accounting treats them as charge offs because from my perspective it s kind of a that gives you misleading look at it but it s just the way the accounting has to work in a way the accounting has to show but there were specific reserves allocated to these that were then just covered the charge off amount we don t expect that to be any kind of repeatable on a regular basis i think what you ve seen with us overall i think was like we had 9 basis points of charge offs in the last year i guess maybe 6 basis points the year before and i think our trends will continue to be should be well below the industry based on what we see right now but it was a little bit of a noisy quarter because of those three that that paid off steve moss b riley fbr analyst okay robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer million of the plus 4 million net charge offs numbers related to those three credits steve as we said in the script steve moss b riley fbr analyst all right thank you very much i appreciate that robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator and our next question today comes from russell gunther at d a davidson please go ahead russell gunther d a davidson analyst hey good morning guys robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning russell russell gunther d a davidson analyst a couple of quick follow ups here the first you so i d start by saying i appreciate all the color on the expense glide path you also commented you guys continuously strive for positive operating leverage so tying all of that together is that something that you anticipate being able to achieve for 2020 that core efficiency ratio ending the year lower than the 2019 result robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would say one of the things that we continue to do is continue to optimize our branch network as well too i mean we ve closed 15 branches in the last three years since january 2017 roughly 7 or so of our franchise we re looking real hard at that in terms of our branch infrastructure obviously having 237 branches on a 15 billion bank is a lot of branches but we benefit from a lot of rural areas where we ve got branch deposits and things like that so we re evaluating that we re looking at all of that but i m very strongly want us to during we can to maintain a positive operating leverage not just because we re doing m a i mean m a by its very nature is going to generate positive operating leverage but outside of that from an organic perspective it s something that we really look hard so we re looking hard at the expense side of the branch optimization piece of it and then also the key is i think particularly with old line is to not hit any bumps on the revenue production side as we finish the conversion and move forward with them and so far that looks really good and we re getting a nice lift from some of our prior acquisitions now as well as well too it takes a year or two to kind of assimilate them through before you start seeing growth i don t think that will happen with old line but that has been the case with our prior acquisitions but i m still very much believe in positive operating leverage and on a long term basis we think that s very important to us and have an efficiency ratio that s something we can be proud of even though it s impacted a little bit by durbin right now and the margin had a big impact on everybody s efficiency ratio last year so you kind of everybody had to level set to a new level russell gunther d a davidson analyst got it okay thank you todd appreciate it and you kind of touched on my final comment which or question circling back to the loan growth expectations you guys laid out i m just wondering if you could parse it a little bit in terms of sort of growth expectations within the newer mid atlantic footprint and what that would then imply for some of the legacy markets and growth rates there todd f clossin president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i look at the loan growth overall we had from a obviously 1 organic loan growth but that s with those heavy payoffs right things go into the secondary market and over 200 million in the fourth quarter so if you were to just use more of a normalized rate for that you d be looking at around 3 low to mid single digit growth rate but those large commercial real estate payoffs we think that trend is going to continue at least for the first half of this year but when i look at the momentum that i feel we ve got at old line and just our production overall i think is very good we did 1 6 billion in production last year which is a 40 increase over and above the year before so from a production standpoint i don t see it being a big issue at all from a c i perspective we re up 5 9 year over year on an annualized growth rate so we re getting that mid single digit growth rate in c i it s just the things that are going to the secondary market that s a big headwind for everybody so when i look at old line s portfolio obviously it s heavily real estate oriented so they are going to have things going into the secondary market they are going to continue to have those headwinds as well but we ve got a lot of growth opportunities i think what really matters is when does the slowdown in things going into the secondary market occur when do the rate scenario get to the point or when is the marketplace get to the point where everything that s going to go to the secondary market or the majority of it has actually gone to the secondary market so you don t see that big headwind that everybody continues to face right now i would tell you with total of 600 million or so last year that went to the secondary market to outgrow that and to show mid single digit loan growth with that kind of volume going into the secondary market i personally think that s unsafe and i think that if banks that are showing that kind of loan growth with that kind of money going to the secondary markets you really got to ask what are they doing because they do think that s a real headwind that we don t want to change our underwriting standards just because more loans are going to the secondary markets it s a worse thing we could do so we were keeping discipline with regard to underwriting making sure what we are doing is smart and at some point that those headwinds will abate and we ll start to show i think commercial real estate growth in line with the mid single digits that we re currently seeing in the c i area so i guess long winded answer to your question but again i was out in the mid atlantic markets last week and i feel really good about the momentum there the pipeline there and the lenders the customers i met with you got couple of loan requests just on the calls last week we re seeing some nice growth in kentucky where a couple of our acquisitions were a few years ago it s one of our top growth markets right now so i feel good about this stuff but if still the headwinds abate that s going to be the that s going to be the challenge and the pipelines for both commercial and resi are up over 50 from where they were at the end of 2018 so that s helpful as well russell gunther d a davidson analyst that s very helpful thank you both that s it for me robert h young executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to todd clossin for any closing remarks todd f clossin president and chief executive officer great i appreciate the time

strength across our u s branded portfolio both segments contributed to the sales increase in constant currency the company grew sales 2 gross profit margin increased 120 basis points versus the year ago period driven by cost savings which were led by the comprehensive continuous improvement cci program operating income was 299 million in the fourth quarter compared to 292 million in the year ago period this increase was driven by higher sales and gross margin expansion offset partially by higher planned brand marketing investments and additional incentive compensation expense driven in part by favorable non operating income results the company recorded 4 million of special charges in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding special charges adjusted operating income grew 3 to 303 million compared to 294 million in the year ago period or a 4 increase in constant currency earnings per share was 1 59 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 1 60 in the year ago period special charges lowered earnings per share by 0 02 in the fourth quarter of 2019 special charges as well as an adjustment associated with the non recurring impact of the u s tax legislation u s tax act lowered earnings per share by 0 07 in the fourth quarter of 2018 excluding these impacts adjusted earnings per share was 1 61 in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 1 67 in the year ago period the decrease in adjusted earnings per share was driven by an unfavorable adjusted income tax rate which more than offset the increase in adjusted operating profit the unfavorable adjusted income tax rate was due to lower favorable discrete tax items recognized including the impact of the exercise of stock options in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the corresponding 2018 period fiscal year 2019 results mccormick reported a 1 sales increase in 2019 compared to 2018 which included a 2 unfavorable impact from currency new products and growth in the base business across both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove the increase in constant currency the company grew sales 3 gross profit margin increased 60 basis points versus the year ago period this expansion was driven by cci led cost savings operating income was 958 million in 2019 compared to 891 million in the prior year this increase was driven by higher sales and gross margin expansion as well as lapping prior year transaction and integration expenses from the acquisition of the frank s and french s brands partially offsetting this increase was higher incentive compensation expense driven in part by favorable non operating income results operating income margin increased 110 basis points versus the year ago period in fiscal 2018 the company recognized 23 million of transaction and integration expenses in operating income related to the acquisition of our frank s and french s brands the company recorded 21 million of special charges in 2019 related to

earnings per share grew to 5 35 in 2019 compared to 4 97 in 2018 driven primarily by higher adjusted operating income lower interest expense and higher income from unconsolidated operations this resulted in an 8 increase in adjusted earnings per share which includes an unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates the company continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached a record 947 million in 2019 an increase from 821 million in 2018 the strong operating cash flow was mainly driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements as the company continues to focus on paying down debt a portion of this cash was used to pay down 436 million of acquisition debt the company ended the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 3 4x fiscal year 2020 financial outlook mccormick expects continued global growth in consumer demand for great taste and healthy eating mccormick is aligned with consumers increased interest in bolder flavors demand for convenience focus on fresh natural ingredients and transparency around the sourcing and quality of food as well as the need to know about the environmental and social impacts behind the brands they buy through its growth strategies the company is well positioned to meet this increased consumer demand and drive sales of its broad flavor portfolio through brand marketing new products and expanded distribution the company is continuing to drive sales growth balanced with its focus on lowering costs to sustainably realize long term earnings growth the company expects minimal impact from currency rates in 2020 on net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share in 2020 the company expects to grow sales compared to 2019 by 2 to 4 this increase consists entirely of organic growth as the company has no incremental sales impact from acquisitions in 2020 the company expects to drive sales growth with new products brand marketing and expanded distribution sales growth is also expected to include the impact of pricing which in conjunction with cost savings is expected to offset anticipated mid single digit inflationary pressures the company has plans to achieve approximately 105 million of cost savings and intends to use these savings to improve margins fund investments to drive continued growth and as a further offset to increased costs the company expects strong underlying business performance driven by sales growth will continue in 2020 which will be more than offset by a significant incremental investment associated with business transformation and a higher projected effective tax rate excluding this investment and tax headwind mccormick s growth from the underlying operating performance is expected to be strong and in line with its long term organic growth objectives operating income in 2020 is expected to range from comparable to an increase of 2 from 958 million of operating income in 2019 the company projects that the incremental expenses in 2020 associated with its business transformation investment will reduce growth in operating income by approximately 6 in addition approximately 8 million of special charges are currently projected for 2020 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions excluding the impact of special charges in 2020 and 2019 adjusted operating income is projected to be comparable to adjusted operating income of 979 million in 2019 within an expected range from a 1 decline to a 1 increase this expected range includes projected strong underlying base business growth of 5 to 7 substantially offset by the 6 business transformation investment impact mccormick projects 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of 5 15 to 5 25 compared to 5 24 of earnings per share in 2019 the company s projected earnings per share growth from its strong underlying business performance is more than offset by 2020 incremental business transformation expenses estimated to be a 7 reduction in growth and a 3 headwind from an expected increase in the projected effective tax rate to approximately 22 excluding an estimated 0 05 impact of special charges in 2020 the company projects 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of 5 20 to 5 30 which is an expected decline of 3 to a decline of 1 for fiscal year 2020 the company

results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles these financial measures exclude the impact as applicable of the following in our consolidated income statement we include separate line items captioned special charges and transaction and integration expenses in arriving at our consolidated operating income special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up front costs and organizational structural impact to require advance approval by our management committee upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs

the sum of short term borrowings current portion of long term debt and long term debt less the amount of cash and cash equivalents that exceeds 75 0 million because we are a multi national company we are subject to variability of our reported u s dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed on a constant currency basis is a non gaap measure we believe that this non gaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the u s it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results percentage changes in

results for entities reporting in currencies other than the u s dollar are translated into u s dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year

at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week president donald trump again talked positively about negative interest rates that s not a very good idea considering negative interest rates are a warning signal of deflation which can be as bad for an economy as runaway inflation but trump was right to herald this era of low nominal interest rates and inflation if you want to understand how the dow jones industrial average has risen from a low of 800 to a high of 29 000 in four decades look at the federal reserve s graph of the 10 year treasury rate showing the sharp and relentless decline in interest rates between 1980 and 2020 think about how the world has changed in 1981 10 year treasury bills paid an interest rate of 16 now they are at 2 it may be the biggest unsung story of economic success a gift that just keeps on giving sign up free daily newsletter sign up i remember in the early 1980s my local bank was trying to lure depositors by offering lifetime certificates of deposit paying 10 to 12 interest rates many of the banks that made such foolish offerings failed in the years to come what happened federal reserve chairman paul volcker teamed together with ronald reagan in a political partnership that slew inflation bringing it down from 12 to 4 in about 18 months the high nominal interest rates back then were simply the price we all paid for runaway inflation which rose to 12 in 1980 the consensus among economists and leading financiers was that double digit inflation was with us for decades to come as paul samuelson warned about in his weekly newsweek column whoops what was not foreseen was that reagan and volcker would start a new economic regime to kill inflation that prevails to this day we now live in an era with interest rates lower than at any time in decades and the forecast is for borrowing costs which are driven primarily by inflation and inflationary expectations to remain microscopic for years and decades to come why do these low rates matter to the economy let s start by imagining the added cost to buying or selling a home today if we still had mortgage rates as high as they were back then homeowners would be paying thousands of dollars of extra mortgage payments a year and real estate values would crash as would homebuilding second low interest rates raise stock values and wealth inflation and high interest rates are the thieves of the stock market the towering inflation of the late 1960s through 1980 corresponded with a near 60 collapse in the after inflation return on stocks it was one of the greatest liquidations of wealth in u s history a bloodbath disinflation and falling interest rates combined with a stable dollar have helped resurrect growth while u s assets owned by the public have reached 100 trillion in value third low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing costs for businesses and allow small firms that might not have access to equity markets to expand investment through loans by the way real inflation adjusted interest rates rise when there is a higher demand for credit which happened in the 1980s even as nominal rates plummeted the biggest winner of all from low rates is of course uncle sam every 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates reduces federal borrowing costs by at least 1 trillion over a decade a sudden spike in rates by say 200 basis points which would still be below the historical average in the post world war ii era means 2 trillion to 3 trillion of higher interest expenditures on top of 20 trillion of publicly traded debt a final point i keep hearing senior citizens and financial advisers complain that low interest rates hurt retirees on fixed incomes that s nonsense seniors tend to hold more stocks than young people so the surge in stock values has disproportionately benefited older people in the united states seniors who complain about today s low returns on bonds should be taking a look at how their stock portfolios are performing in just

surge in the stock market in the 1970s seniors living on fixed incomes were supposed victims of high inflation and interest rates because it cost them more to buy food medicine and energy higher

requirements a recurrent nightmare for market operators i remember my 1 standby fee to tap a billion bucks at 7 5 from a bank syndicate it was late 1987 on the eve of black monday before that in 1982 paul volcker pressed rates as high as 15 i bought five year fannie mae paper yielding 15 then my three partners gave me the bum s rush trying mightily to push me out the window on the 42nd story of the general motors building presently our tamed frb worries over the deflationary impact of low interest rates in our system this is a novelty covering the entire postwar history of money and banking unmentioned by today s fed is that aside from committing to buy tons of treasuries they hold in hand no other stimulus tools actually they re timid buyers of treasuries fearing to add to federal debt already bulging on the books consider the budget deficit running over a trillion annually remains on chancy footing and could see a 2 trillion shortfall in a recessionary setting trump s tax cuts did the job and now steven mnuchin is talking about succor delivered to the middle class you do whatever you have to do for reelection even if it bankrupts the country the congressional budget office needs to speak out coming clean on prospects for our swelling budget deficit maybe exceeding 5 of current gdp this surely puts us in the class of a banana republic in normal times huge federal deficits prompted the fed to raise interest rates unrelentlessly but deflationary forces in today s world seem more n more entrenched zero or near zero interest rates even negative numbers prevail in japan and parts of europe with no sign of an upbeat in flattish economies deflation in the commodity sector is more n more pervasive the world is awash in oil and gas surpluses with flattish demand commodities like steel iron ore copper and aluminum likewise remain in a surplus condition stocks like alcoa u s steel and occidental petroleum still fade badly u s steel again tests a single digit low of nine bucks and change with a pervasive top heavy capital structure conceptually economists abhor deflationary constructs of low interest rates minimal inflation and sloppy commodity prices academics fear deflation reduces consumer spending nobody buys in advance if prices stay flattish major sectors like automobiles appliances and apparel come to mind housing of course is the exception mortgage rates at 3 5 for single family homes trigger refinancing and incremental demand but housing as a percentage of gdp isn t a dominant sector there s a reason not to fear flattish gdp because personal consumption expenditures should hold up at 70 of our gdp everything else like the trade balance gross private investment capital spending and inventories are smaller sectors volatile and unpredictable quarter by quarter if you believe as i do that low interest rates last for a couple of years along with commodity deflation it dictates a reallocation of equity assets over several sectors of the market you don t want your money in oil and gas properties same goes for commodities like steel aluminum copper and iron ore exxon mobil is a doggy stock making new lows i ve rethought my overweighted position in the financial sector namely banks and cut back to market weighting mainly citigroup there s no case for rising net interest margins so no leverage in operating earnings while the price earnings ratio for bank stocks particularly citigroup stands near 60 of the s p 500 index expect no near term closing of the valuation discount i don t understand why warren buffett would want to add to his bank of america holding nor why he bought more wells fargo not so long ago wells is a comparatively poor sector performer its headman now banished from the business for his mufti pufti with fictitious client service fees pulled out of thin air conversely historically a low interest rate setting favors growth stocks technology reigns as the dominant sector of the s p 500 index over 22 by comparison energy s now just 5 exxon mobil a major market capitalization stands as a non performer these past five years today the market is dominated by a handful of tech and internet houses namely microsoft alphabet amazon facebook and apple fifteen years ago general electric held primacy with a market capitalization of 415 billion while exxon mobil was number three at 280 billion citigroup was number five american international group in seventh place at 186 billion became a basket case in the 2008 2009 financial meltdown with citigroup needing a reverse split to regain a double digit price status barring recession technology paper should continue to outperform where else are there big capitalization story stocks valuation is nowhere near tech bubble craziness of 2000 price earnings ratios ebitda ratios and operating cash flow numbers on projections for this year and next aren t in the clouds low twenties or below for facebook alphabet microsoft and apple i can t model amazon so i don t play here top five names in the s p 500 just five years ago comprised just 11 of weighting currently we re closer to 20 these babies run nearly twice as volatile as the market both ways so the list stands or falls on their performance everything else seems irrelevant consider johnson johnson and exxon mobil as well as berkshire hathaway were in 2014 s top five names wells fargo was number six and general electric sat in seventh place meanwhile facebook and alphabet were near bottom in the top 25 listing i doubled back to track price earnings ratios over 50 years the market traded at 18 times earnings in 1972 but a deep real estate recession crushed the market in 1973 1974 in 2000 the index exceeded 20 times while yearend 2014 we ticked at 17 times earnings starkly 1972 premiums for growth ranged up to four times the market but not for long the deep recession plus worldwide competitive forces collapsed earnings for polaroid xerox avon products and eastman kodak they never came back lemme use the dangerous phrase today it s different there s no japanese or chinese company that can stand up to facebook microsoft alphabet and apple certainly alibaba is a prospective challenger to amazon in e commerce and i own it r d productivity at facebook apple microsoft and alphabet are determinants of future long term growth rates who knows what you can say is these four growthies plow back heady percentages of revenues in r d we ll soon see whether they re throwing away their money net net low interest rates favor growth stocks only a deep recession kills them off by crushing p e ratios and earnings not my call our frb reclines a paper tiger declawed and sleepy sosnoff and or his managed accounts own citigroup bank of america wells

at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week president donald trump again talked positively about negative interest rates that s not a very good idea considering negative interest rates are a warning signal of deflation which can be as bad for an economy as runaway inflation but trump was right to herald this era of low nominal interest rates and inflation if you want to understand how the dow jones industrial average has risen from a low of 800 to a high of 29 000 in four decades look at the federal reserve s graph of the 10 year treasury rate showing the sharp and relentless decline in interest rates between 1980 and 2020 think about how the world has changed in 1981 10 year treasury bills paid an interest rate of 16 now they are at 2 it may be the biggest unsung story of economic success a gift that just keeps on giving i remember in the early 1980s my local bank was trying to lure depositors by offering lifetime certificates of deposit paying 10 to 12 interest rates many of the banks that made such foolish offerings failed in the years to come what happened federal reserve chairman paul volcker teamed together with ronald reagan in a political partnership that slew inflation bringing it down from 12 to 4 in about 18 months the high nominal interest rates back then were simply the price we all paid for runaway inflation which rose to 12 in 1980 the consensus among economists and leading financiers was that double digit inflation was with us for decades to come as paul samuelson warned about in his weekly newsweek column whoops what was not foreseen was that reagan and volcker would start a new economic regime to kill inflation that prevails to this day we now live in an era with interest rates lower than at any time in decades and the forecast is for borrowing costs which are driven primarily by inflation and inflationary expectations to remain microscopic for years and decades to come why do these low rates matter to the economy let s start by imagining the added cost to buying or selling a home today if we still had mortgage rates as high as they were back then homeowners would be paying thousands of dollars of extra mortgage payments a year and real estate values would crash as would homebuilding second low interest rates raise stock values and wealth inflation and high interest rates are the thieves of the stock market the towering inflation of the late 1960s through 1980 corresponded with a near 60 collapse in the after inflation return on stocks it was one of the greatest liquidations of wealth in u s history a bloodbath disinflation and falling interest rates combined with a stable dollar have helped resurrect growth while u s assets owned by the public have reached 100 trillion in value third low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing costs for businesses and allow small firms that might not have access to equity markets to expand investment through loans by the way real inflation adjusted interest rates rise when there is a higher demand for credit which happened in the 1980s even as nominal rates plummeted the biggest winner of all from low rates is of course uncle sam every 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates reduces federal borrowing costs by at least 1 trillion over a decade a sudden spike in rates by say 200 basis points which would still be below the historical average in the post world war ii era means 2 trillion to 3 trillion of higher interest expenditures on top of 20 trillion of publicly traded debt a final point i keep hearing senior citizens and financial advisers complain that low interest rates hurt retirees on fixed incomes that s nonsense seniors tend to hold more stocks than young people so the surge in stock values has disproportionately benefited older people in the united states seniors who complain about today s low returns on bonds should be taking a look at how their stock portfolios are performing in just three years under trump index funds have seen better than a 50 return some 60 trillion of wealth is held by seniors today and will soon be passed on to the younger generations thanks to this 40 year surge in the stock market in the 1970s seniors living on fixed incomes were supposed victims of high inflation and interest rates because it cost them more to buy food medicine and energy higher interest rates would correspond with a higher cost of living so seniors should be careful of what they wish for so should trump his administration is benefiting mightily from low rates and tame inflation to which his supply side policies including tax cuts have contributed but negative rates would mean falling prices and the last time that happened the nation found itself heading into the great depression copyright 2020 creators com
dubai afp advertising read more a flare up of a currency war between yemen s foes has sent the riyal crashing aggravating a humanitarian crisis that has already driven millions to the brink of famine after five years of conflict the confrontation was sparked when the iran aligned huthi rebels who control the capital sanaa and most of the north banned the use of new banknotes printed by the central bank in aden which is run by the internationally recognised government the ban on the notes which were first issued three years ago came into effect on january 19 when residents and money changers stopped dealing with them under the threat of a 10 year jail term according to sources close to the rebels the huthis insist they are safeguarding the people against high inflation but the move has slashed purchasing power and effectively created two exchange rates around 682 to the dollar in aden and 600 in sanaa and the north the currency s value has dropped some 15 percent in the south in the past five weeks and about seven percent in the north in a slide that shows no sign of slowing in the marketplaces of yemen stalls are piled high with tomatoes onions and bananas while nearby shopkeepers offer racks of clothes and consumer goods but ordinary people are increasingly distressed at the loss in value of their cash which has inflicted more misery in a long war that pits the huthis against the government which is backed by a saudi led coalition prices are extremely expensive we are not receiving our salaries and the situation is going from bad to worse said abdo a resident of the port city of aden in sanaa which has been under rebel control since 2014 residents also hit out at the measure the ban has resulted in massive harm to citizens many of us own quantities of the new banknotes but from now on we will not be able to use them to buy our day s food abdulaziz ali told afp a senior un official warned earlier this month that certain factors that threatened to trigger famine last year in yemen including a plunge in the value of the national currency were once again looming large with a rapidly depreciating riyal and disrupted salary payments we are again seeing some of the key conditions that brought yemen to the brink of famine a year ago ramesh rajasingham who coordinates humanitarian aid in the country told the un security council we must not let that happen again he said adding that even if it escapes famine yemen will remain the world s worst humanitarian crisis in 2020 blackmailing the people the yemeni government moved the central bank from sanaa to aden in 2016 in order to have effective control on monetary policy currency and payment of wages but the central bank s historic home in sanaa is still operating under the huthis who have stewardship over the country s major consumer markets the sana a centre for strategic studies said in a recent report that the tussle threatened to collapse the the riyal based system and had driven the country towards the use of hard currencies mostly saudi riyals and united states dollars a population in which millions already verge on starvation is set to bear increasing costs further eroded purchasing power and a deterioration in the humanitarian situation resulting from the escalating currency war it said anthony biswell an economic analyst from the sana a centre said that the north was suffering from a shortage in supply of the old riyals and that ordinary citizens were turning to the black market to convert their new notes for the south there will be an excess of the newly printed bank notes in circulation the expectation is it will lead to inflation he told afp the goods are coming in the major issue is purchasing power and people s ability to go buy commodities that are available in the market he said the government of president abedrabbo mansour hadi said the rebels measure was oppressive and will devastate the economy accusing the huthis of blackmailing the people the prime minister met with ambassadors of the european union and we called on them to apply pressure on the huthis to scrap the ban yemen s planning and international cooperation minister najeeb al ouj told afp a majority of yemen s population of 29 million are living in dire circumstances after five years of war with at least 11 million struggling to find enough food according to the un world food programme 2020 afp

washington d c united states of america january 28 2020 apo group on december 20 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation with the federal democratic republic of ethiopia at the same time the board approved three year arrangements under the extended credit facility ecf and the extended fund facility eff for ethiopia a press release on this was issued separately ethiopia has sustained high economic growth over the last decade substantial progress on reducing poverty and improving social indicators has also been noteworthy in 2018 19 real gross domestic product gdp is estimated to have grown by 9 percent driven by manufacturing and services however performance of goods exports remained weak and foreign exchange shortages persist policies appropriately targeted at containing public investment and debt contributed to a further narrowing of the current account deficit to 4 5 percent of gdp and a reduction in public and publicly guaranteed debt to 57 percent of gdp inflation remained elevated in double digits largely due to higher food prices though non food inflation has also been trending upward while revenues came in below target cuts in expenditure contained the fiscal deficit to 2 5 percent of gdp below budget the authorities have announced a homegrown economic reform plan consisting of a mix of macroeconomic structural and sectoral policies to address vulnerabilities and tackle structural bottlenecks inhibiting private sector activity the macroeconomic policy measures envisaged under the plan to address external imbalances debt vulnerabilities and inflation are expected to contribute to a slower growth in real gdp of 6 2 percent in 2019 20 public expenditure restraint and tighter monetary policy are expected to contribute to a gradual reduction in inflation reserves are expected to improve to around us 4 billion by end 2019 20 sufficient to cover 2 months of prospective imports due to higher external financing flows including from the fund over the medium term macroeconomic and structural reforms announced by the authorities are expected to lead to a reduction in public debt lower external vulnerabilities and stronger growth investment and exports this outlook is subject to downside risks in particular from domestic opposition to reforms ahead of the upcoming elections rising protectionism worldwide weaker than expected global growth and climate related shocks executive board assessment executive directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal they noted that ethiopia s growth model driven by public investment had supported rapid growth and remarkably improved living standards over the past decade at the same time it has led to a build up of debt and external vulnerabilities directors highlighted the urgency of fundamental reforms to correct macroeconomic imbalances ease structural bottlenecks and lay the foundation for sustainable inclusive growth led by the private sector to this end directors welcomed the ambitious homegrown economic reform plan which is appropriately built around macroeconomic structural and sectoral reforms they considered that the plan together with the authorities strong ownership and commitment deserves fund support which would help catalyze private investment and donor financing noting high implementation risks amid external vulnerabilities and political uncertainty directors underscored that steadfast determination strong communication and social protection would be key to obtain a broad based public buy in they also urged the authorities to seek additional debt reprofiling from external creditors to improve debt dynamics directors supported a comprehensive approach to addressing the exchange rate overvaluation and foreign exchange shortages they agreed with the priority placed on increasing exchange rate flexibility reducing inflation strengthening competitiveness and rebuilding international reserves they recommended a reform roadmap to transition to a market clearing exchange rate regime directors also supported monetary tightening complemented by spending restraint by state owned enterprises soes and the phasing out of central bank financing of the government and the development bank of ethiopia dbe continued efforts are needed to modernize the monetary policy framework and further develop financial markets to deepen inclusion directors stressed the need to reform soes to reduce public debt vulnerabilities and improve governance and transparency in this context it would be important to reduce soes borrowing strengthen their financial positions and prioritize investment activities immediate priorities also include an asset quality review of the commercial bank of ethiopia and a strategy to address the dbe s non performing loans and develop a sustainable financing model directors agreed that reforms are urgently needed to reverse the recent decline in domestic revenue mobilization and to meet ethiopia s social and infrastructure needs they welcomed the planned extension of the value added tax coverage directors also emphasized the need to protect high quality social assistance programs rationalize subsidies and improve expenditure efficiency more broadly directors called on the authorities to build on progress made in improving the aml cft framework and further strengthen data quality it is expected that the next article iv consultation with the federal democratic republic of ethiopia will be held in accordance with the executive board decision on consultation cycles for members with fund arrangements

president and chief executive officer thank you bill thanks to all for joining us today and happy new year from atlantic union bankshares corporation i do want to point out i m fighting a cold so i apologize in advance for the rough voice and occasional cough we closed out an eventful 2018 with a solid fourth quarter by continuing to execute on our strategic plan and hitting the loan and deposit growth targets we revised last quarter as we begin 2020 we continue to believe we have a great opportunity before us to create something uniquely valuable for our shareholders and the communities we serve and remain keenly focused on reaching the full potential of this powerful franchise atlantic union accomplished much in 2019 to start we closed the access national bank acquisition on february 1st and converted their core systems in may successfully and uneventful rebranded the company to atlantic union and changed the stock trading symbol to aub delivered 8 deposit growth while loan growth was 6 for the year the year end loan to deposit ratio was in line 95 target right where it should be we completed the transformation of the executive leadership team with the hiring of david zimmerman in the fourth quarter to head up our wealth management group middleburg financial approved and rolled out our new three year strategic plan to our teammates added an established equipment financing team to close the commercial banking product gap launched zelle and added ncino to address digital product gaps won a number of a customer experience awards including the much coveted number one ranking for the j d power retail banking satisfaction survey for the mid atlantic region in 2019 with the mid atlantic region defined by j d power as virginia to new york state there was none better last a focused initiative to take advantage of the coming market disruption from the truist merger rob will provide more details on the financial performance in his section but for operating metrics for the fourth quarter our operating return on tangible equity was 16 01 which is a 37 basis point increase from the third quarter for the full year our operating rotce was 16 14 operating return on assets was 1 30 up 1 basis points from the prior quarter for the full year operating roa was 1 31 operating efficiency ratio was 52 65 which is a 247 basis point decrease from the prior quarter in late 2018 we communicated that we had updated our top tier financial targets to the following operating rotce between 16 and 18 operating roa between 1 4 and 1 6 and an operating efficiency ratio of 50 or below we made those updates then expecting to operate in a rising rate environment and stepped up our top tier financial metrics accordingly as the economic and geopolitical environment materially changed over the course of 2019 we shifted expectations for the federal reserve to cut rates even then the rate environment was below our expectations and there was a sustained inversion of the yield curve that negatively impacted our net interest margin and revenue growth throughout the year despite the adverse changes in the rate environment we did perform well against our original 2018 targets given the challenging current and expected operating environment for banks rob will comment on our revised financial targets for 2020 and 2021 in his remarks to focus on maintaining top tier financial performance regardless of the operating environment loan growth was 10 annualized for the quarter point to point while average loans grew 3 q4 is predictably a stronger seasonally in loan growth and we saw significant growth materialize late in the quarter headwinds to growth in q4 were a persistent trend of commercial real estate pay downs remaining at elevated levels and our decision to run off the third party consumer loan portfolio c i line utilization at approximately 40 and total commitments both picked up from the third quarter as a reminder the access acquisition closed on february 1st 2019 on a pro forma basis as if the access balances were included for the full year our year end loan growth was approximately 6 which is consistent with the expectations we communicated during our third quarter earnings call our loan pipelines are well balanced and slightly ahead of where we were this time last year giving us confidence in our 2020 forecast based on everything we know at this time we expect full year 2020 loan growth to be in the 6 to 8 range including the impact of further run off of our third party consumer loan portfolio we expect to take advantage of the disruption caused by the truist merger but we do expect headwinds from the continuation of elevated pay downs in the cre portfolio as rate expectations for the year suggest the institutional non recourse long term fixed rate market will remain an attractive substitute product for cre clients our deposit growth was about 8 annualized for the quarter point to point and average growth was approximately 15 for the full year 2019 deposit growth was approximately 9 point to point which was at the higher end of our upper single digit growth guidance given the current strength we believe we ll be able to match deposit growth with loan growth for 2020 in the 6 to 8 range and maintain our loan to deposit ratio at our target of 95 turning to credit credit quality remained solid in the fourth quarter the economy in our footprint is steady unemployment in virginia ticked down to 2 6 among the lowest in the nation and we still do not see any evidence of systemic credit deterioration in our loan portfolio quarterly charge offs were 15 basis points annualized down 10 basis points in the prior quarter the full year net charge off ratio was 17 basis points as we ve seen in prior quarters a big part of charge offs at atlantic union bank about 60 for the quarter came from our third party consumer loan portfolio which as mentioned continues to run off barring some unexpected change in the macroeconomic environment we aren t expecting a change in credit quality in 2020 as i have consistently said over the past three years i do believe problem asset levels at atlantic union and across the industry remain below the long term trend line and i still believe that to be true eventually we will see a return to more normalized credit losses but we can t tell you went to expect that as we re not yet seeing any evidence of a systemic downturn moving away from the quarter s financial highlights and looking ahead we rolled out our new three year strategic plan to our teammates in the second half of the year our plan stays true to how we like to operate atlantic union bank which is maintained forward progress press our advantage where we can and do what we say we re going to do but as you know us and our story the strategic plan continues a logical progression of what we ve been working on for some time our roadmap to achieving the objectives of the strategic plan are our strategic priorities which i have outlined before i ll provide an update to those priorities diversify loan portfolio and revenue streams we made solid progress on our commercial banking effort and the commercial loan categories of c i and owner occupied real estate now make up one third of our total loan portfolio we stood up an equipment finance team in the fourth quarter to close a competitive gap in our commercial offerings and the team hit the ground running closing about 12 million in loans during the month of december the new capability has been very well received by our commercial banking teams and we re excited about the potential for this group over time complementing our c i strategy is a growing treasury management services annuity fees income stream treasury management transformed beginning of 2018 with the hiring of a new product development team of segmentation of tm support by line of business and an ambitious undertaking to enhance our service offerings we now have a robust tm platform comprised of inside and external sales teams a product management team and a sales and implementation team new tm revenue in various stages of implementation totals 1 9 million in annual run rate plus a record 1 3 million in the pipeline next grow core funding as i mentioned earlier our loan to deposit ratio is currently at our target of about 95 we continue to believe we have opportunities to grow our deposit base and deepen our market share for example we piloted a bank at work program in our coastal region in the fourth quarter which targets the consumer banking needs of our commercial client employees we ve taken the learnings from that pilot and are now in the process of launching this effort across our footprint the bank at work program is an important product to grow consumer accounts and low cost deposits and helps to strengthen our commercial client relationships next manage the higher levels of performance as we mentioned earlier we aim to stay in the top quartile of our peers as measured by rotce roa and efficiency ratio metrics we believe we have a number of opportunities to improve the efficiency of the bank by reengineering our end to end processes for example we are focused on taking out laborious manual processes and reducing rework wherever we can with a companywide robotic process automation initiative improving efficiency and scalability is an important focus for us in 2020 next strengthen our digital capabilities as i mentioned before during 2019 we implemented table stakes technology improvements like zelle in the consumer bank and ncino in the commercial bank middleburg financial will have a comprehensive new wealth management platform in the first half of 2020 that will improve the client and teammate experience and close an important competitive gap we re piloting a new digital account opening solution that simplifies the enrollment process and that should launch in february we re adding debit card controls and enhanced notifications and alerts for real time updates to customers in the first quarter we have installed or upgraded wi fi in all branches so customers can more easily receive assistance to setup online and mobile banking which is important for new and existing customers some of the new digital capabilities address gaps with our larger competitors bringing us closer to parity with the most frequently used functionality while we don t intend to lead the market in digital innovation we must be competitive and current with our digital offerings to remain in the consideration set for new customers especially those considering leaving a larger bank next is make banking easier we launched a product called transition checking that enables customers who might not otherwise qualify for traditional checking product to establish or reestablish themselves in the banking system by offering a fee based account that has no overdraft privileges we successfully piloted a project to issue temporary instant debit cards at our branches and will roll that out across the system starting this month debit card issuance time has been a pain point for our customers and this will resolve the issue we re also rolling out contactless debit cards to customers in the first quarter we installed electronic signature capture pads at all branches to eliminate paper streamline process improve quality and create a more consistent experience for applications and forms we ve revamped the consumer lending team and their approval processes to speed up home equity line of credit approvals and have already seen a 25 reduction in average cycle time we streamlined our treasury management services on boarding process and simplified documentation by developing a master services agreement that allows clients to easily add new services we further expanded our tm product set with a number of new offerings such as integrated payables on a better purchasing card product and finally capitalize on strategic opportunities since we don t know what the future holds we must be nimble and able to react to a changing marketplace the greatest market opportunity we re likely to see over the next few years is the truist merger and during 2019 we hired 39 people from the truist companies in a variety of roles we are expecting considerable truist branch closures in our virginia trading areas which we expect to begin in late 2021 and we ll be ready for the coming disruption as for other strategic opportunities it should be clear from my comments we re busy and focused on internal improvements at the moment and still have a number of projects to finish in the near term having said that we still believe atlantic union bank is in the best position to further consolidate virginia and look to fill in our mid atlantic trade area our choice of atlantic in the atlantic union bank name was intentional as we think we have the potential to become the premier mid atlantic regional bank it s my preference to focus internally for as long as possible in 2020 to gain efficiencies inside the bank to become more scalable and to improve our competitive positioning however we have demonstrated we re able to leverage m a as a shareholder value creating secondary strategy and that remains at our playbook in summary atlantic union had another solid quarter and a good 2019 we continue to make steady progress against our strategic priorities and delivered good financial performance despite headwinds from the adverse interest rate environment i remain highly confident what the future holds for us and the potential we have to deliver long term sustainable financial performance for our customers communities teammates and shareholders i can think of no better way to finish my comments in the new year than by reiterating atlantic union bankshares is a uniquely valuable franchise it s dense and compact in great markets with a story unlike any other in our region we have assembled the right scale the right markets and the right team to deliver high performance in a franchise that can no longer be replicated in virginia we have growth opportunities in our north carolina and maryland operations in what we believe will be a multi year disruption with one of our largest competitors i ll now turn the call over to rob to cover the financial results for the quarter and for 2019 rob robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today i d now like to take a few minutes to provide you with some details of atlantic union s financial results for the fourth quarter and for 2019 please note that for the most part my commentary will focus on atlantic union s fourth quarter and full year financial results on a non gaap operating basis which exclude 709 000 in after tax merger related costs and 713 000 in after tax rebranding related costs in the fourth quarter it also excludes 22 3 million in after tax merger related costs and 5 1 million in after tax rebranding costs for the full year of 2019 for clarity i will specify which financial metrics are on a reported versus non gaap operating basis in the fourth quarter reported net income was 55 8 million and earnings per share were 0 69 that s up approximately 2 6 million or 0 04 from the third quarter for the year ended 2019 reported net income was 193 5 million and earnings per share were 2 41 up 47 million or 0 19 per share from 2018 levels reported return on equity for the fourth quarter was 8 81 and 7 89 for the full year reported return on assets was 1 27 for the fourth quarter and was 1 15 for 2019 reported efficiency ratio was 57 4 for the quarter and 62 37 for the full year on a non gaap operating basis which as noted excludes 1 4 million in after tax merger related costs and rebranding related costs for the quarter and 27 4 million for the year consolidated net earnings for the fourth quarter were 57 3 million or 0 71 per share which is up from 56 1 million or 0 69 per share in the third quarter for the full year 2019 operating net earnings were 221 million or 2 75 per share which is up 43 million or 0 04 per share from 2018 levels the non gaap operating return on tangible common equity was 16 01 in the fourth quarter and was 16 14 for the full year the non gaap operating return on assets was 1 3 in the fourth quarter and was 1 31 for 2019 non gaap operating efficiency ratio was 52 65 in the fourth quarter and was 53 6 for the full year of 2019 as a reminder we remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance relative to our peers since the fall of 2018 we have been targeting the following operating financial metrics an operating return on tangible common equity within a range of 16 to 18 and operating return on assets in the range of 1 4 to 1 6 and an operating efficiency ratio of 50 or lower when we set these targets at the end of 2018 we expected to operate in a rising rate environment which will result in net interest margin expansion and solid revenue growth however this did not materialize as market interest rates declined materially since the beginning of 2019 given this challenging current and expected operating environment for banks and its impact on revenue growth caused by the intractable lower for longer interest rate environment which we now expect will persist in 2021 we are revising our operating financial metric targets accordingly to the following return on tangible common equity within a range of 15 to 17 return on assets in the range of 1 2 to 1 4 and an efficiency ratio of 53 or lower our financial performance targets are set consistently in the top quartile among our peer group regardless of the operating environment and we believe these new targets are reflective of the financial metrics required to achieve top tier financial performance in the current economic environment now turning to the major components of the income statement for the fourth quarter tax equivalent net interest income was 137 8 million down 1 6 million from the third quarter primarily due to lower earning asset yields during the quarter driven by lower average market rates and changes in the average earning asset mix from the third quarter net accretion of purchase accounting adjustments for loans time deposits and long term debt added 18 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter which is up from the third quarter 13 basis point impact primarily due to increased levels of loan related accretion income the fourth quarter s tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 55 that s a decline of 9 basis points from the previous quarter for the full year tax interest margin was 3 69 which is down 5 basis points from 2018 s net interest margin of 3 74 the 9 basis point decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter was principally due to an 18 basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets partially offset by a 9 basis point decline in the cost of funds the 18 basis point decrease in the quarter to quarter earning asset yield was primarily driven by 17 basis point decline in the loan portfolio yield and a 3 basis point negative impact related to changes in earning asset mix in the quarter decline in the loan portfolio yield of 17 basis points was driven by lower average loan yields of 22 basis points partially offset by the 5 basis point benefit from higher loan accretion income average loan yields were lower primarily due to the impact of declines in market interest rates during the quarter notably the significant declines in the one month libor and prime rates the 3 basis point earning asset yield decline resulting from changes in the earning asset mix from the prior quarter was due to the buildup of liquidity during the quarter resulting from the timing of deposit inflows early in the quarter and the funding of loan growth late in the quarter which shouldn t carry over into future quarters the quarterly 9 basis point decline in the cost of funds to 1 was primarily driven by a 28 basis point decline in wholesale borrowing cost favorable changes in the overall funding mix between quarters and by lower interest bearing deposit costs which declined 6 basis points from the third quarter s 125 basis points the provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter was 3 1 million or 10 basis points on an annualized basis which is a decrease of 6 million or 19 basis points from the third quarter the decrease in the loan loss provision from the previous quarter was primarily driven by lower levels of net charge offs for the quarter of 2019 net charge offs were 4 6 million or 15 basis points on an annualized basis compared to 7 7 million or 25 basis points for the prior quarter as in previous quarters a significant amount of the net charge offs came from non relationship third party consumer loans which are in run off mode for the year net charge offs were 20 9 million or 17 basis points non interest income declined to 29 2 million for the fourth quarter from 48 1 million in the prior quarter the decrease in non interest income was primarily driven by life insurance proceeds of approximately 9 3 million related to the acquisition of xenith and a gain of approximately 7 1 million due to the sale of investment securities recorded in the third quarter excluding these third quarter items non interest income declined by 2 5 million driven by lower loan related interest rate swap income of 2 million due to lower transaction volumes and seasonally lower mortgage banking revenue of 685 000 excluding merger related costs and rebranding related costs in both the third and fourth quarters of 2019 operating non interest expense decreased by 15 6 million or 15 to 92 5 million when compared to the prior quarter the decrease in operating non interest expense was primarily due to the recognition of approximately 16 4 million loss on debt extinguishment in the third quarter resulting from the repayment of approximately 140 million in federal home loan bank advances and the termination of related cash flow hedges salaries and benefits declined by 2 5 million primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and higher deferred costs related to new loan originations this decreases were partially offset by increases in marketing expense of approximately 1 1 million due to increases in direct mail and sponsorships professional fees of 955 000 related to higher consulting costs for strategic initiatives fdic expenses of 873 000 primarily due to a lower fdic small bank assessment credit earned in the fourth quarter and oreo and credit related expense of approximately 542 000 due to oreo valuation adjustments driven by updated appraisals received during the quarter as a reminder we achieved our 25 million access related merger cost saves target on a run rate basis at the end of the third quarter also please note that we do not expect to incur any additional merger cost or rebranding expenses in 2020 the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 16 7 compared to 16 8 in the third quarter for the full year the effective tax rate was 16 2 in 2020 we expect the full year effective tax rate to be in the 16 5 to 17 range turning to the balance sheet period end total assets stood at 17 6 billion at december 31st which is an increase of 122 million from september 30 levels and an increase of 3 8 billion from december 31st 2018 levels primarily as a result of access acquisition and loan growth during the year at quarter end loans held for investment were 12 6 billion an increase of 304 million or approximately 10 annualized while average loans increased 87 4 million or 2 9 annualized from the prior quarter on a pro forma basis as if the access acquisition had closed on january 1st instead of february 1st year to date loan balances grew approximately 6 on an annualized basis through december 31st of 2019 looking forward as john mentioned we project loan growth of approximately 6 to 8 for the full year of 2020 inclusive of the expected run off of third party consumer loan balances at december 31st total deposits stood at 13 3 billion an increase of 260 3 million or approximately 8 from september 30th while average deposits increased 491 million or 15 3 annualized from the prior quarter deposit balance growth during the fourth quarter was driven by increases in money market and interest checking balances partially offset by seasonal declines in demand deposits and lower time deposit account balances on a pro forma basis as if the access acquisition had closed on january 1st deposit balances increased approximately 9 for the full year loan to deposit ratio was 94 8 at year end which is in line with our 95 target for 2020 as john noted we expect to achieve deposit growth of 6 to 8 which will be in line with our loan growth expectations now turning to credit quality non performing assets totaled 32 9 million or 26 basis points as a percentage of total loans a decline of 3 5 million or 4 basis points from third quarter levels the allowance for loan losses decreased 1 5 million from september 30th to 42 3 million primarily due to lower incurred losses embedded in the consumer loan portfolio as it continues to pay down and an improved economic environment which was partially offset by loan growth during the quarter and now i would like to provide further thoughts on how the adoption of the current expected credit loss model or cecl will impact atlantic union as you know under the new cecl accounting standard that went into effect on january 1st lifetime expected credit losses will now be determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the loan portfolios since our last seasonal update in october the economic outlook and portfolio characteristics have been consistent to slightly improved and the company now estimates that the allowance for credit losses will increase to approximately 95 million or more than double the allowance reserve level as of december 31st under the former incurred loss methodology as previously noted the allowance increase under cecl is primarily driven by the company s acquired loan portfolio and the consumer loan portfolio we have completed an independent validation of our cecl model and we plan to disclose the final allowance impact in our 10 k once we have worked through the full governance process for the day one recognition from a shareholder stewardship and capital management perspective we are committed to managing our capital resources prudently as the deployment of capital for the enhance the enhancement of long term shareholder value remains one of our highest priorities as such during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0 25 per common share an increase of 0 02 per share or approximately 9 compared to the prior year s quarterly dividend level the board of directors had previously authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to 150 million of the company s common stock through june 30th 2021 in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions as of january 17th we have repurchased 2 4 million shares at an average price of 36 91 or 89 6 million in total the total remaining authorized shares to repurchase is approximately 60 million so to summarize atlantic union delivered solid financial results in the fourth quarter and in 2019 despite the headwinds of the lower interest rate environment and the company continued to make progress toward its strategic growth priorities we are revising our operating financial metric targets to reflect the challenging interest rate environment which we expect will persist in 2021 but we remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance relative to our peers finally please note that we remain focused on leveraging the atlantic union franchise to generate sustainable profitable growth and remain committed to building long term value for our shareholders and with that i ll turn it back over to bill cimino to open it up for questions from our analyst community william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations thanks rob and carl we re ready for our first caller questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of casey whitman from piper sandler the line is now open john c asbury president and chief executive officer hi casey good morning casey orr whitman piper sandler analyst good morning hi good morning rob just to be clear on the updated financial targets you just outlined what are you assuming for further rate cuts if any robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes on that front casey what we re assuming is that there is no further rate cuts by the fed in 2020 and 2021 where but the curve remains in line with where it is today a flat curve in terms of the nim forecast that we re looking at in terms of those targets that we set we are thinking we will be stabilizing at the levels you see in the fourth quarter on a core basis expect to be in about 3 35 to 3 40 range on a core basis now if the fed were to cut which the implied curves indicate maybe in the second half of this year you could see that range could drop to the 3 30 to 3 35 range going forward casey orr whitman piper sandler analyst okay understood let me ask a question about expenses so your core expense run rate is now at around 92 5 million and you ve got at least the fdic expense is likely normalizing back up in the first half of the year so where do you think expenses shake out until the 20 or i think last call you had guided to like a 4 to 5 increase in expenses for in 20 is that does that still apply here or sort of what are your general thoughts about expenses in 20 robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s exactly right casey so we coming out of the fourth quarter we think we re at a run rate of about 92 million that includes some of the impacts of the investments we made this year we are expecting to increase that run rate approximately 4 next year as we continue to invest in the various technologies digital product and people etc including a wage inflation factor of about 3 so we re looking at about a 4 increase in that run rate on a full year basis next year obviously the quarters will be a little different as there is some seasonality in the first quarter which will be a little higher than an average for each of the quarters john c asbury president and chief executive officer and casey this is john i would add that to some extent you can expect to see this front end load a bit yes there is the seasonal aspect rob points to but there is a surge of activity going on in the company and we are making hay while the sun shines in terms of we are not working on a merger right now and we are very focused on completing a number of important initiatives to position the company for the future and there are some things that will begin to drop off the schedule as we get into the second half of the year so i ll kind of leave it at that but i would reiterate what rob said don t look for it to be evenly distributed look for it to be a little more loaded toward the front end and then an improving trend at the back end casey orr whitman piper sandler analyst very helpful thanks guys i ll let someone else jump on john c asbury president and chief executive officer thank you casey william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations and carl we are ready for our next caller please operator your next question comes from the line of catherine mealor from kbw the line is now open catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks good morning robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer hey catherine john c asbury president and chief executive officer hi catherine catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods analyst just wanted to follow up on the margin guidance that you gave rob as we think about loan yields it seemed like the legacy loan yields had a pretty big decline this quarter how are you thinking about loan yields going into next year and maybe where new production is coming on right now versus where the legacy loan yield is currently sitting and then on the other side of the balance sheet maybe on deposit cost how much further reduction do you think you can get in deposit cost if we don t see any further rate cuts robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so in terms of the guidance on margin as mentioned we feel like we re going to be stabilizing in the range you see in the fourth quarter some of that is when you look at the detail of that we re going to see additional loan yield earning asset yield compression not material but we think we can offset that with additional reductions in our cost cost of funds primarily and the cost deposits we do have some opportunities in lowering various deposit rates it is a bit of a tail on some of our promotional money markets that we have a six month promotional money market promotions out there some of which we ll reprice as we continue into this year so we think there s opportunity there actually money markets came down about 30 basis points quarter to quarter so we re expecting that would come down a little further we are seeing a little more pressure on the loan yields as well but when you match up the compression on that versus lower deposit costs we should be able to stabilize in this 3 35 to 3 40 range again assuming no rate cuts coming down the pike catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods analyst got it and then in that does that also assume a level of deployment of the excess liquidity that we saw in this quarter as well robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right yes so as i mentioned there was about 3 basis points of lower margin due to that liquidity so that also comes into play as well in that guidance catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods analyst got it ok and then i noticed also the fair value accretion guidance came down i think it was about i think it was about 60 million last quarter for 2020 and now its 13 7 million is this just from kind of is this from cecl or can you give any color on why the decline robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes in terms of what you see in the earnings release we have not updated that projection or what we think cecl is we re still working through the potential for cecl the decline there is primarily because we accelerated you saw a little bit of acceleration in the fourth quarter which kind of reduced the go forward number our feeling is that when we recalculate under cecl that we will see a bit of a pick up for an acceleration if you will that accretion more in 2020 then what s currently showing up on that chart so we will continue to work through that we will give better guidance probably in the next quarter on that but that s probably a conservative estimate at this point catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense great thank you very much john c asbury president and chief executive officer thanks catherine william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations and carl we re ready for our next caller please operator your next question comes from the line of william wallace from raymond james the line is now open john c asbury president and chief executive officer good morning wally how are you william wallace raymond james analyst thank you good morning very good thank you maybe just following up on the last line of questioning on so how would you anticipate your reserve to trend in 2020 once you implement cecl should they be flat on our reserve to loan basis or up or continue to be down like we saw in 19 robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes well interestingly on that front wally as you know we book day one impact we as we ve estimated would be about 95 million you will see that coming down primarily because of the run off in our consumer third party consumer book where presumably that we ve got the lifetime losses embedded in that day one projection so we won t be replenishing that reserve for at least our book of business for any charge offs that come through assuming that we ve estimated properly so you can expect that would come down over time just all things being equal and the portfolio mix remaining the same the drivers of increasing that of course will be loan growth in the other book of business the other loan portfolios that we have on the books but and of course if there is major changes in the economic outlook more risk more tendency toward a recession that could drive the reserve up as well but as we look forward now i think you could expect to see the day one reserve level come down a bit over the year william wallace raymond james analyst okay thank you and then the 95 million impact does that include the purchased loans is that the full impact robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right wally that s correct yes william wallace raymond james analyst so what s the capital impact then robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the capital impact is about we calculate about 20 basis points to 25 basis points in terms of regulatory capital will be phased in over three years william wallace raymond james analyst okay and so but the tce impact will be immediate in that robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer call it on tce probably call it about 20 bps to 25 bps william wallace raymond james analyst okay robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes william wallace raymond james analyst and then so looking at your financial your revised financial targets that 15 to 17 return on tangible common what tce base do you assume for those targets robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer we expect it as we ve mentioned i think we our goal is to be at about 8 5 tce and i think our projections call for that to be about 8 5 to 8 75 for this year including the impact of the cecl william wallace raymond james analyst okay right okay john i believe in your prepared remarks you mentioned the continued opportunity around truist branch closures did you say that you anticipate those closures in late 2021 john c asbury president and chief executive officer yes what you re saying wally is that because virginia has the most overlap including the greater washington area of any of their markets in the system they intend to go last year presumably to get it right and so we do not expect those closures to occur until the latter part of or least the second half of next year as you may have read they are saying that there will be no branch closures anywhere for a year which doesn t surprise me just given the scale of this combination we ve seen leadership announcements of course have come through they are consolidating their commercial banking teams for the time being suntrust branches and bb t branches continue to run effectively independently and so we have we are adjusting a few of our plans accordingly yes surprisingly we do market research you d be surprised at how many consumers have no earthly idea these two companies are merging at this point not a clue the commercial customer certainly did so we don t want we need to make sure that we synchronize some of our initiatives with the maximum disruption opportunity on the consumer side william wallace raymond james analyst okay so you were through the award and there were no announcements on any new m a in 2019 you have continued opportunity around truist disruption through 2021 or even in to 2022 it sounds like how does the m a discussion change or does it change in 2020 john c asbury president and chief executive officer not really if you listened my comments were carefully made so what we re saying is that we have a number of initiatives and i listed off quite a few that have been completed and there are more under way so our heart is probably right now is to really get ahead of this truist as i said i feel like we ve got the opportunity while we re not engaged and a merger transaction conversion integration effort we need to make a run for it we need to knock out and get us close to competitive parity as we can during this window of opportunity having said that the level of discussion that s going on out there the level of inbound inquiries that we are receiving does lead us to believe that there will be opportunities when we decide that it s time it is we are not of the mindset that we would want to do anything this year but we have conversations continuously we ll continue to evaluate this in real time we look at the full spectrum of opportunities on the m a front and i would say that there is a very real opportunity as we get into 2021 you could see us active again but for now what we do not want to do is to put off or delay strategically important initiatives internally and they are all just products by the way i hinted at this we ll talk later on about we have a stem to stern review of processes inside this organization we will be implementing we are implementing it s happening now robotic process automation there are a number of things that do cost us some money frankly on the front end that will make the company more efficient more scalable more productive and offer higher quality and so this is the window to do it so that is our view william wallace raymond james analyst okay thanks and this is just a ticky tack question rob but are we done with merger costs and as a quick follow up when should we see the discontinued operations go ahead robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks yes merger costs are done and rebranding costs you ve done so we re basically running at an operating go forward here operating expense base william wallace raymond james analyst and on discontinued same thing robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yes william wallace raymond james analyst okay great thanks i ll let somebody else ask a question now john c asbury president and chief executive officer thanks wally william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations thanks wally and carl we are ready for our next caller please operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston from stephens inc the line is now open john c asbury president and chief executive officer hi brody brody preston stephens inc analyst hi good morning everyone how are you john c asbury president and chief executive officer good morning brody preston stephens inc analyst i just had a couple just clean up questions before i get into some of my other questions so i guess just following up on the cecl commentary so i guess just the 20 basis points to 25 basis points that would be about a 35 million capital impact somewhere in that range is that fair rob robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes that s about right brody brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then i guess as i think about as i think about the reserve ratio moving forward i understand that the consumer book is running off but as the acquired book also runs off i m assuming that that s carried at a if we segment the buckets for the loan loss reserve between origination and acquire originated and acquired i m assuming that that acquired bucket is the reserve ratio on that is a little bit higher and so as that runs off does that also i guess add to the loan loss reserve ratio moving lower over time robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i don t think that s going to impact it that much in terms of the acquired the acquired book let s say the good acquired book which is what we re putting the reserve at which is pretty much in line with legacy union s reserving so i wouldn t expect that that s going to be a driver there is of course the pcb the purchased credit deteriorated but that s not a big number for us here brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then on the share repurchases just comparing the press releases it looks like you bought back about 45 million worth of stock this quarter just wondering if you had the shares repurchased or the average price that you repurchased that just for the fourth quarter robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think in total it s like 36 91 since we started and the fourth quarter was i think was about 37 30 or so 37 40 brody preston stephens inc analyst okay great thank you and i guess just going back to the nim guidance you said you sort of expect that to stabilize in this 3 35 to 3 40 on a core basis is that is that gaap core nim that you re guiding to robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer when you say gaap brody preston stephens inc analyst yes i mean you provide yes you provide an fte and a gaap margin in your press release and so just think out that the core margin on a gaap and an fte basis just robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s fte basis that we re talking about here brody preston stephens inc analyst okay so it sounds like maybe just a little bit more compression in the first quarter and then sort of stable to up from there robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s perfect brody preston stephens inc analyst okay all right i just wanted to touch on what percent of loans the loan portfolio is tied to libor and how much of that is one month libor robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the total book about 24 is tied to one month libor so it s pretty sensitive to that libor rate and as you know it declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter about 30 basis points i think so that was a big driver of the loan yield compression you saw we saw brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and what percent of the portfolio is tied to prime robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer about 12 to 13 brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and i m assuming these loans sort of reprice throughout the quarter on a monthly basis robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that s right brody preston stephens inc analyst okay robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer somewhat relates to back swaps which we price a little more i guess about monthly basis i think they typically reprice brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then on the cd book i guess i was a little bit surprised to see the cost of cds flat to up a basis point just given some of what i saw you were doing on the cd pricing front in the quarter and so i guess what was the driver of that and what could we expect for time deposit costs moving forward robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think what you should be seeing those coming down i think that s a reflection of some of the higher rate cds that we were running us promotions during the second and third quarter that that are playing out but you can expect to see those rates coming down as we ve this we ve lowered the rates over the last two quarters so going into next year you will see those declining as you ll see money market rates start to come down as well brody preston stephens inc analyst all right and then just a couple of a couple of quick ones left the mortgage was a little bit weaker than i was looking for and it looks like refi volumes aren t quite as strong as i would have thought i just wanted to better understand what drove that robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes actually i think in terms of what our expectations were it came in pretty well when you consider that fourth quarter is typically a lower seasonal quarter for mortgages so we felt pretty good about that so we were expecting that to tick down for the quarter brody preston stephens inc analyst okay and then wealth management you had a pretty good a pretty strong quarter in terms of aum wanted to get a sense for how much of that was market related versus new inflows and what s your outlook for 2020 for that business might be just given some of the leadership changes robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say a lot of what you saw there was driven by the market in terms of the driving aum up less so of new business coming in although we did have some coming in remains to be seen in terms of expectations in 2020 our new leadership there is undergoing a review of the entire business unit and we do expect to see an uptick there but some of that is dependent on where some of it s market driven as well in terms of aum so we ll see where we go from there but taking that out of the equation we do expect to see it some positive momentum in that business but pretty it s too early to tell at this point brody preston stephens inc analyst all right great thank you very much everyone john c asbury president and chief executive officer thanks brody robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brody william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations and karl we are ready for our next caller please operator your next question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker from compass point the line is now open laurie hunsicker compass point analyst hello thanks john c asbury president and chief executive officer hi laurie good morning laurie hunsicker compass point analyst hi good morning rob i just wanted to go back to margin again i know you ve talked a lot about it but directionally as we look at just the accretion income piece and i m thinking about reported margin i just want to make sure that i have this right apples to apples because accretion income was so big this quarter so if we re looking at it going forward your reported margin just keeping in line with your comments on your core margin you reported margin probably is going to track in that the 3 45 so like high 3 40 s 3 48 3 49 range am i doing that the right way robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i ve got it 3 45 to 3 50 depending on core that s right laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay perfect i just want to make sure i got that right okay and then just a few things on expenses here just specifically three line items looked outsized and i wondered if you could help us think about that around your comments the technology the professional and the marketing was there any one time items that drove those higher robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer not really other than and the marketing uptick we had some credits in the third quarter which did not recur in the fourth quarter so the fourth quarter was a bit more of a run rate basis for marketing in terms of technology and processing we re starting to see the impact of some of the initiatives that we put in place during the year for instance zelle adds to processing costs etc so there is an uptick related to some of those items that started to come through in the fourth quarter and the other item which one was that that was professional fees laurie hunsicker compass point analyst so just the technology yes and the professional fees for robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes professional fees we do have some consulting expenses we re incurring related to some of the initiatives that we re putting in place we re putting in a new deposit pricing platform that we ve spent some consulting dollars on got some other projects robotic automation as john alluded to so there s some up consulting related to strategic initiatives that s embedded in those numbers laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay and so i guess and one more question here as we think about the branches that you closed obviously no more or at least in the near term no more rebranding or branch closure expenses but are the cost saves from those branch closures now fully phased or are we going to see robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes so we that s right on spot i think we said about 400 000 500 000 a quarter that we did see in the fourth quarter laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay and then where do you guys stand in terms of thinking about branch closures for this year are you feeling good about the numbers john c asbury president and chief executive officer we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the culling that we ve done something that we are exploring we re about to do one as we have an opportunity enrichment where we re going to go essentially close two branches and move them into one new better location and as we assess the franchise and i ll ask shawn o brien head of consumer banking to comment we think we could replicate that model end up with better located fewer branches in metropolitan markets and lower our expense run rate shawn we don t want to get into too much detail but any perspective you can share on that shawn e o brien executive vice president and consumer banking group executive yes all i d add is that through acquisition we have some branches that aren t super consistent with our brand and not necessarily in the best shape and so we d like to get a little bit less of a dense franchise footprint and i think we can do that probably by taking 14 12 14 branches over time and consolidating them into seven newer branches so that s kind of what we re looking to do but that s a bit of a long term play as we build out those new branches laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay okay great and then john you mentioned through 2019 you had hired 39 people from bb t suntrust how are you still actively looking to hire and then just of those 39 how many people are part of your c i team thanks john c asbury president and chief executive officer i guess the answer is we re always in the market for talent and we are not going to have a big net add a lot of those were not all net adds to be very clear and so we had i would say a good half of that number would be in various roles in retail bank especially branch managers with outstanding alternative who are really bankers coming out of these larger organizations and i m looking to dave ring on here maybe best guess maybe 40 or so of those would be commercial banking related and we think the relationship manager david v ring executive vice president and commercial banking group executive yes about 15 between commercial originators and credit oriented folks and for this year you know probably adds in the single digits in total but it s like john said it s more of a net number because we know we have retirements and other things that we will replace this year laurie hunsicker compass point analyst great great okay one last quick question here question for you rob your third party consumer what is the balance and then of that what s lending club thanks robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes in terms of the lending club we re about 118 million at the end of the quarter so that was down about 22 million or 23 million and on that front laurie by the end of this year we expect to be less than probably 15 million or less as it continues to run off laurie hunsicker compass point analyst great and then do you have the number for what your third party consumer originatives i know most of its lending club with the total robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we had about another in terms of service finance we have about 100 million some odd in that third party program which we will also be running down this year as well laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay so you re still you re right around 200 million 220 million robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes a little over yes probably more like in the 225 million 230 million range laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great thanks i ll leave it there robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you laurie william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations and carl we have time for one last caller please operator your next question comes from the line of eugene koysman from barclays the line is now open john c asbury president and chief executive officer good morning eugene eugene koysman barclays analyst good morning thank you i wanted to follow up on your loan growth target for 2020 can you share how much of that 6 to 8 loan growth are you expecting to come from the legacy truist customers john c asbury president and chief executive officer no we cannot do that eugene koysman barclays analyst that s fair and can you help us maybe you give us some color on how your initiatives to go after the truist customers are progressing john c asbury president and chief executive officer very well i ll ask maria tedesco president of atlantic union bank to provide some commentary we have a comprehensive set of initiatives now the timing of some of these has changed a bit certain guerrilla marketing tactics for branches that are going to be consolidated doesn t really make a lot of sense at this point in time maria do you want to speak just in terms of high level project forgive me i just said it project sundown for those of you who don t know it is our formally secret code name so we re taking advantage of the suntrust bb t disruption i hope you see the humor in sundown maria p tedesco president of atlantic union bank well again we see this as a multi year opportunity this is we are planning on a marathon event with initiatives to go over the next couple of years but much of what you see us doing is now closing the gap of who our sort of competitive set is exactly what we re doing so those are the short term plans but we see this as an offensive plan we know this disruption we re ground zero for this event and we have a sense of what will happen that will be disruptive to customers that will make it opportunistic for us so those initiatives without getting into much detail is really set against what we believe to be the timeline of disruption and literally every business has their plan in which to be offensive and be opportunistic john c asbury president and chief executive officer and recognizing that this is a public forum we don t want to show our hand too much but rest assured there is a very robust action plan to maria s point each line of business has a very targeted set of initiatives and i would reiterate this is a multi year disruption it has begun this will play out for years maria p tedesco president of atlantic union bank yes and i think you ll see a lot of the initiatives that we ve even talked about today on this call help us be a stronger competitive positioning in the market but certainly those with specific product gap john c asbury president and chief executive officer and on the commercial side we do discreetly track clients that we have won coming out of bb t or suntrust and trust me there is a list and it s growing we re not going to get into details but we re having pretty good success chipping away at that eugene koysman barclays analyst that sounds pretty good given the number of technology initiatives you ve talked about can you share with us what is your technology budget for the last year and for 2020 and maybe help us understand how much of it you re spending to run the bank versus innovate the bank john c asbury president and chief executive officer yes i don t want to answer the former question eugene in terms of too much specificity on exactly what we re using for digital strategy in some respects there is certainly a dollar cost issue here but one of the bigger constraints for a mid size bank like us candidly is not so much the dollars although that s important it s having the subject matter experts available to work the project and that is the single biggest reason why we don t want to do a very near term acquisition because we will take this very same people offline to work on a merger conversion integration and we need them focused on laying this out rob can you what if anything would you share in terms of how much do you think we re spending on new will be a relatively small portion robert michael gorman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think incrementally you re probably talking about maybe a 10 increase year over year from what we ve normally spent on that so incrementally including all digital investments in ranking all the automation the zelles of the world the ncinos of the world so i would say probably good 10 increase in our budget related to technology john c asbury president and chief executive officer and then beyond technology budget per se you have to think holistically i m looking at kelly dakin now who s head of digital strategy and customer experience kelly how many people on your team now today kelly dakin chief digital and chief customer experience officer there is 17 people that support digital strategy and another three that support customer experience john c asbury president and chief executive officer and when i got here it was probably 1 5 you ve been here just under a year and how much you walked into kelly dakin chief digital and chief customer experience officer i walked in there was about four people john c asbury president and chief executive officer about four so there you go so it s people as well who are working on these initiatives and you can expect to see on the digital strategy side that the idea is to have essentially a quarterly release schedule and so there is a plan that goes out for a long long time in terms of the timeline of things you want to do everything from continuous upgrades to the mobile banking suite of offerings new product initiatives some of this needs to be modulated if we were in a higher rate environment frankly we d be doing more than we re going to do right now but we re going to see the things that need to done i m sorry eugene there s probably that s much clarity as we re willing to share publicly eugene koysman barclays analyst this is actually very helpful thank you very much william p cimino senior vice president and director of investor relations thank you gene and thanks everyone for

op ed views and opinions expressed are solely those of the author at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last week president donald trump again talked positively about negative interest rates that s not a very good idea considering negative interest rates are a warning signal of deflation which can be as bad for an economy as runaway inflation but trump was right to herald this era of low nominal interest rates and inflation if you want to understand how the dow jones industrial average has risen from a low of 800 to a high of 29 000 in four decades look at the federal reserve s graph of the 10 year treasury rate showing the sharp and relentless decline in interest rates between 1980 and 2020 think about how the world has changed in 1981 10 year treasury bills paid an interest rate of 16 now they are at 2 it may be the biggest unsung story of economic success a gift that just keeps on giving i remember in the early 1980s my local bank was trying to lure depositors by offering lifetime certificates of deposit paying 10 to 12 interest rates many of the banks that made such foolish offerings failed in the years to come what happened federal reserve chairman paul volcker teamed together with ronald reagan in a political partnership that slew inflation bringing it down from 12 to 4 in about 18 months the high nominal interest rates back then were simply the price we all paid for runaway inflation which rose to 12 in 1980 the consensus among economists and leading financiers was that double digit inflation was with us for decades to come as paul samuelson warned about in his weekly newsweek column whoops what was not foreseen was that reagan and volcker would start a new economic regime to kill inflation that prevails to this day we now live in an era with interest rates lower than at any time in decades and the forecast is for borrowing costs which are driven primarily by inflation and inflationary expectations to remain microscopic for years and decades to come why do these low rates matter to the economy let s start by imagining the added cost to buying or selling a home today if we still had mortgage rates as high as they were back then homeowners would be paying thousands of dollars of extra mortgage payments a year and real estate values would crash as would homebuilding second low interest rates raise stock values and wealth inflation and high interest rates are the thieves of the stock market the towering inflation of the late 1960s through 1980 corresponded with a near 60 collapse in the after inflation return on stocks it was one of the greatest liquidations of wealth in u s history a bloodbath disinflation and falling interest rates combined with a stable dollar have helped resurrect growth while u s assets owned by the public have reached 100 trillion in value third low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing costs for businesses and allow small firms that might not have access to equity markets to expand investment through loans by the way real inflation adjusted interest rates rise when there is a higher demand for credit which happened in the 1980s even as nominal rates plummeted the biggest winner of all from low rates is of course uncle sam every 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates reduces federal borrowing costs by at least 1 trillion over a decade a sudden spike in rates by say 200 basis points which would still be below the historical average in the post world war ii era means 2 trillion to 3 trillion of higher interest expenditures on top of 20 trillion of publicly traded debt a final point i keep hearing senior citizens and financial advisers complain that low interest rates hurt retirees on fixed incomes that s nonsense seniors tend to hold more stocks than young people so the surge in stock values has disproportionately benefited older people in the united states seniors who complain about today s low returns on bonds should be taking a look at how their stock portfolios are performing in just three years under trump index funds have seen better than a 50 return some 60 trillion of wealth is held by seniors today and will soon be passed on to the younger generations thanks to this 40 year surge in the stock market in the 1970s seniors living on fixed incomes were supposed victims of high inflation and interest rates because it cost them more to buy food medicine and energy higher interest rates would correspond with a higher cost of living so seniors should be careful of what they wish for so should trump his administration is benefiting mightily from low rates and tame inflation to which his supply side policies including tax cuts have contributed but negative rates would mean falling prices and the last time that happened the nation

repeat of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in part because beijing had acted more quickly and radically this time while the sars outbreak initially caused steep losses for asian stocks they rebounded smartly in its wake one hurdle this time is that many equity markets globally are trading at stratospheric valuations the u s s p 500 index is trading at a price earnings

there are many issues on the minds of americans just ahead of the first caucuses and primaries in the 2020 presidential election according to gallup polling the top five extremely important issues for voters are health care national security gun policy education and the economy the next highest issues are immigration climate change and abortion but for catholics according to analysts who spoke with the register overarching all of these individual issues will be the competing and very different positions that the republican and democratic parties are taking on them collectively health care the 2020 democratic front runners favor either government run single payer medicare for all or a public option with a potential transition to single payer former vice president joe biden who has been leading in national polling described his health care plan on his campaign website as a public health insurance option like medicare building on obamacare affordable care act and expanding its subsidies biden initially claimed that his plan would allow people to keep their private insurance but in a recent interview with the new york times clarified that if you like your private insurance and your employer keeps it with you you can keep it sens bernie sanders i vt and elizabeth warren d mass who trail biden in national polling are proponents of single payer medicare for all which would eliminate private insurance in favor of a government run plan they have been repeatedly challenged on how they re going to pay for their medicare for all plans which are estimated to cost as much as 34 trillion over the first decade of implementation after refusing to say how much it might cost sanders asserted recently that his medicare for all plan would cost substantially less than the current system a claim that was called into question by the new york times warren released a 26 trillion spending proposal for medicare for all and a transition plan both of which were met with criticism president donald trump has repealed portions of obamacare including eliminating the individual mandate which penalized those not enrolled in health insurance and exempting religious groups like the little sisters of the poor from complying with the contraceptive mandate however he has faced criticism for not fully repealing and replacing obamacare while signing an executive order directing the department of health and human services hhs to improve portions of medicare by increasing plan options for seniors trump criticized democratic policy proposals like medicare for all arguing that they want to raid medicare to fund a thing called socialism the majority of americans 54 still support a health care system based on private insurance according to the latest gallup polling although support for government run health care rose to 42 in 2019 national security trump has taken an aggressive stance against global terrorism touting the recent killing of qassem soleimani iran s head of the islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force a u s designated foreign terrorist organization in a u s led airstrike another u s raid in october killed islamic state isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi the killing of soleimani has escalated tensions with iran something the democratic candidates emphasized as the new york times noted the airstrike has brought national security and foreign policy to the forefront of the issues discussed on the campaign trail sanders and warren support a complete removal of u s troops from the middle east biden said on the debate stage recently that he would leave troops in the middle east in terms of patrolling the gulf calling it a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with isis gun policy the democratic candidates have been calling for tighter gun control laws in light of mass shootings in recent years and have all taken an adversarial stance on the national rifle association nra while some have conceded the importance of the second amendment rights of citizens to own guns all the democratic front runners plan to increase background checks and ban the sale of assault weapons biden s plan includes a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales warren s plan would create a federal licensing system that would require people to obtain a license to buy and own firearms or ammunition trump supports expanding concealed carry laws and opposes bans on automatic weapons and high capacity magazines the trump administration did issue a federal rule banning the use and sale of bump stocks which can help fire semi automatic weapons at faster rates and were used by the 2017 las vegas mass shooter that shooting resulted in 59 fatalities education with the rising costs of education sanders and warren are both in favor of government subsidized free public four year college sanders backs canceling all existing student loan debt warren would do so based on income and biden has called for adjusting debt based on s the total amount of outstanding student loan debt reached an all time high of 1 41 trillion in 2019 biden sanders and warren are in favor of government run and subsidized universal pre k and subsidizing teacher s salaries trump is weighing options for reducing student loan debt including refinancing loans at lower interest rates and getting rid of debt in bankruptcy the trump administration has pushed increases to federal charter school grant aid in addition to supporting charter schools the trump administration has supported vouchers or tax credits for private or religious schools to expand school choice the administration s proposed education freedom scholarships would provide federal tax credits that could be used to pay for private schooling home schooling tutoring and more biden warren and sanders all propose banning for profit charter schools due to concerns over accountability and impact on public schools economy the economy is one area where trump is in a popular position with americans a recent cnn poll found that 76 of americans think the economy is good or very good the unemployment rate hit a historic low of 3 5 in december and the stock market is at an all time high the democrats strategy on the debate stage thus far has been to downplay the economic growth that the trump administration has overseen and focus on wealth inequality which has earned the party criticism and concern over messaging the issue will be a recurring one as americans signal satisfaction with the economy and seek reassurance that democratic candidates would not stall economic growth immigration all the 2020 democratic candidates back a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants currently living in the u s sanders and warren have advocated for decriminalizing illegal border crossings biden is not in favor of this but would ensure that the law was enforced humanely sanders has pledged to pause deportations and abolish immigrations and customs enforcement ice warren would restructure ice but not abolish it and biden has advocated for reforming policies not abolishing ice biden sanders and warren all back covering illegal immigrants under a government run health care plan president trump s push to build a border wall on the u s mexico border is opposed by all of the democratic front runners as are his efforts to rescind the obama era deferred action for childhood arrivals daca policy which deferred deportation for those who were brought to the country as children the trump administration reached an agreement with guatemala to send asylum seekers at the u s border there and is planning to enter similar agreements with el salvador and honduras climate change the democratic candidates have rolled out costly plans for tackling climate change sanders released a 16 trillion green new deal plan to fight climate change that includes building new solar wind and geothermal power sources and committing 200 billion to help poorer nations fight climate change he claimed the plan would pay for itself and create 20 million new jobs warren s plan includes investing 3 trillion to transition to renewable energy and implementing a corporations tax to help pay for her climate change proposals biden s plan includes pressuring china to stop subsidizing coal exports a 1 7 trillion federal investment over 10 years to address climate change and using trump era corporation tax cuts to help pay for it biden recently received criticism for saying that coal miners who will lose their jobs as the u s transitions to fossil fuels should learn to program all the 2020 democratic candidates are in favor of rejoining the obama era paris climate agreement which the trump administration is exiting due to its draconian financial and economic burdens abortion the democratic front runners do not back any restrictions on abortion even after viability the candidates are also united in their support for overturning the hyde amendment and fully funding abortions with taxpayer dollars in contrast trump has earned the praise of pro lifers by reinstating and expanding the mexico city policy ban on funding abortion overseas in 2017 revoked by his predecessor eight years earlier he has honored his pledge to appoint supreme court justices and federal judges supportive of pro life perspectives the administration defunded 60 million from planned parenthood in august 2019 through an hhs rule barring title x funding recipients from referring for abortion on jan 22 trump announced he would address the attendees at the 47th march for life in washington as the first president to attend in person at the jan 24 march he spoke of the dignity of human life every child is a precious and sacred gift from god lgbt issues the 2020 democrats have pushed lgbt accommodations sometimes utterly dispensing with religious freedom concerns all of the democratic front runners have backed the equality act proposed federal legislation that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to title vii of the 1964 civil rights act without religious freedom exemptions biden declared the equality act his no 1 legislative priority as president warren and sanders have also named the legislation a top priority trump is opposed to the equality act stating that while he opposes discrimination the bill in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights the trump administration s department of education also rescinded 2016 obama era guidance requiring that when a school provides sex segregated activities and facilities transgender students must be allowed to participate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity leading moral issues ashley mcguire a senior fellow for the catholic association told the register that the two biggest moral issues for voters in the 2020 election are abortion and religious liberty she argued that judicial appointments were an important aspect of that as well one in five voters said that the biggest issue in determining their vote was the supreme court mcguire noted of the 2016 election a lot of voters feel like the issues that they care most about wind up being determined by nine judges at the supreme court and i think that that is still going to be pretty much true mcguire said that abortion debate is becoming more nuanced as pro lifers have done a very good job of moving the conversation and the debate to be much more about details like abortion when a baby can feel pain and states rights when it comes to determining abortion legislation i think that democrats are going to be forced to take positions on a lot more detailed aspects on the issue of abortion than maybe we ve seen in the past she emphasized tribalism charles camosy associate professor of theology at fordham university and board member for democrats for life of america told the register that increased tribalism will impact this election cycle there is now a question of political tribalism that has formed around donald trump and those who are running against him camosy said unlike last presidential election cycle when things were much more fluid the battle lines are more clear sadly dozens of millions have defined one or another side as the enemy which is to be defeated based more on tribal loyalties than anything to do with issues camosy said that for many the issues are still important and that trump has a concerning record on certain moral issues including separating families at the border in an attempt to use the pain and suffering of children and their parents as a means of deterring immigration and limiting the numbers of refugees which we ve taken from areas of desperate need including areas where the need was created by u s actions on abortion which drove so many swing voters in 2016 donald trump has proved surprisingly good especially given that quite recently he was strongly pro choice he noted the judges he has nominated and the executive actions he has taken have all been in support of prenatal life he has been good at protecting the religious freedom of christians especially those with pro life views he added many pro lifers will vote for donald trump on the basis of these achievements and or because the nominee facing him will be so bad on abortion in 2016 he was a wild card on this issue but in 2020 he is now a known commodity and swing voters will feel more confident in their voting on this issue competing visions brian burch president of catholicvote told the register that for catholic voters the issue of abortion will be preeminent and there will be a stark contrast between the two candidates given what we know of all of the democratic candidates currently and the considerable pro life record that president trump has created in the last three years burch emphasized that the election will be between two competing visions for what the future of america should look like and this implicates the centrality of the family and even the idea of a nation itself whether a nation s identity and its values ought to be defended or whether they are a source of division when viewed through the lens of identity politics increasingly we re being told that to defend the idea of a border of particular values that we cherish that the idea of the family and even of gender itself that these are forms of oppression burch said in reference to the democratic party s rhetoric this is fundamentally in conflict with the idea that the church has proposed about the dignity of the human person and our social nature lauretta brown is the register s washington based staff writer

tangible book value per share 3 tangible common equity to tangible assets 4 earnings per diluted share excluding acquisition costs and 5 return on average assets excluding acquisition costs the company uses these non gaap financial measures to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the company s operational performance and to enhance investors overall understanding of such financial performance in particular the use of tangible book value per share and tangible common equity to tangible assets is prevalent among banking regulators investors and analysts the numerator for the core efficiency ratio is calculated by subtracting acquisition costs and intangible asset amortization from noninterest expense tangible assets and tangible common shareholders equity are calculated by excluding intangible assets from assets and shareholders equity respectively for these financial measures our intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangible tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding we believe that this measure is consistent with the capital treatment by our bank regulatory agencies which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios and present this measure to facilitate the comparison of the quality and composition of our capital over time and in comparison to our competitors non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited further the non gaap financial measure of tangible book value per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for book value per share or total shareholders equity determined in accordance with gaap and

zimbabweans in particular and the world in general clearly can t find confidence in the zanu pf governance system the enduring crisis in zimbabwe presents a conundrum to many people guest column learnmore zuze zimbabweans in particular and the world in general clearly can t find confidence in the zanu pf governance system the enduring crisis in zimbabwe presents a conundrum to many people to the generality of zimbabweans whose only desire is simply the pursuit of a dignified existence the debilitating liquidity crunch foreign currency shortages rising inflation spiralling basic commodity prices erosion of disposable incomes power outages and low productivity are a weight unbearable to carry retrospectively inclusive of the robert mugabe era it would be enormously accurate to say that zimbabwe has shifted from one crisis to another for nearly two decades now twenty years of skills flight and economic instability are a long time of suffering it is for this reason that zimbabweans seem to have resigned to fate to the extent of shunning the stayaways that always result in loss of lives and property zimbabweans passionately loathe the situation in their country but clearly do not have the wherewithal to alter it they are or rather have always existed in a survival mode they are going with the tide of a catastrophe they cannot decipher zimbabweans born around 1999 are moving into adulthood having grown under the cloud of economic uncertainty the zimbabwean political and economic tragedy has become a definition of zimbabwean life while it is easier to understand the zimbabwean crisis in terms of how it presents itself through the economy it is profoundly critical to realise that the zimbabwean tragedy is squarely traceable to the politics of the day this self evident truth was reflective of the mugabe zanu pf and morgan tsvangirayi mdc political feud which culminated in the government of national unity gnu in 2009 in any set up no economic progress can occur in the presence of a political crisis today zimbabwe finds herself caught up in the exact situation where the economic crisis is nothing but a silhouette of the terrible political problems bedevilling the nation the current government has gone around the world on an offensive to win international confidence the bretton woods institution among many other monetary institutions with the potential to assist have been engaged towards extinguishing a colossal us 18 6 million debt and accessing new lines of credit from other financial institutions as things stand a raft of measures including direct threats to businesses operating in the country and the austerity measures have been topical in an attempt to contain the revolting economy with little success banning of the use of the united states dollar has not stopped the public from using it liberalising of fuel imports has not tamed the ever growing fuel queues in the country it appears the more efforts are made to control the damage the more the damage occurs this simply points to one thing zimbabwean problems indicate something deeply wrong with politics without pulling punches the real key to unlocking the situation in zimbabwe is to start by fixing the politics of the country as long as nothing happens in the way of both political and economic reforms then the country still has miles to go it is a given that one of the worst things to happen to the present administration is failure to win confidence of the zimbabweans in particular and the world in general for example it is an open secret that zimbabweans have plenty of foreign currency stashed in different places in their homes as they mistrust taking it to banks history has contributed to this apprehension people remain sceptical of taking their hard currency to banks in order to get the bond notes it is simply a question of lack of confidence in the government by zimbabweans the forex reserves held by people probably run into millions but an apparent lack of confidence in the system is feeding the crisis coming to how confidence of the international community has been harmed there really is no secret america was honest enough to tell the zimbabwean government that it needed to fulfil some tough conditions including political and electoral reforms accountability for past atrocities and compensation for white farmers who lost their land under mugabe s land reform programme among others the us even went further clearly highlighting that it was urgent that the soldiers who killed protesters in the august 1 2018 post election demonstrations be made to account we may debate theories postulate and pontificate about the economic malaise in zimbabwe but the untainted truth is that massive changes have to occur within the broader politics of the country it must be clearly mastered that a simplistic view in mending the economy is self defeating fixing the zimbabwean crisis is not as easy as picking an alternative currency like the rand or pula in the absence of production where almost everything has to be imported coupled with an archaic industrial infrastructure then no economy can be revamped it sounds

before a mysterious respiratory illness emerged in the center of china spreading with lethal effect through the world s most populous nation concerns about the health of the global economy had been easing replaced by a measure of optimism the united states and china had achieved a tenuous pause in a trade war that had damaged both sides the specter of open hostilities between the united states and iran had reverted to stalemate though europe remained stagnant germany the continent s largest economy had escaped the threat of recession now the world is worrying anew an outbreak originating in china and reaching beyond its borders has summoned fresh fears sending markets into a wealth destroying tailspin it has provoked alarm that the world economy may be in for another shock offsetting the benefits of the trade truce and the geopolitical easing and providing new reason for businesses and households to hunker down on monday investors dumped stocks on exchanges from asia to europe to north america they entrusted their money to traditional safe havens pushing up the value of the yen the dollar and gold they pushed down the price of oil over fears that weaker economies would spell less demand for fuel in short those in control of money took note of a growing crisis in a country of 1 4 billion people whose consumers and businesses are a primary engine of economic growth around the world and they chose to reduce their exposure to risk by late monday the virus had killed more than 100 people in china more than 4 500 had been infected mostly in mainland china but also in hong kong japan macao malaysia nepal singapore south korea taiwan thailand and vietnam and as far away as australia canada and the united states advertising the emergence of the virus in china whose government jails journalists and tightly controls information left the world uncomfortably short of facts needed to assess the dangers it s the uncertainty of how the global economy is going to respond to the outbreak said philip shaw chief economist at investec a specialist bank in london that will depend on the severity the spread and the duration of the outbreak he said and we don t really know the answers to any of these questions what was left to the imagination resonated as a reason for investors to unload anything less than a sure thing stocks in japan and europe fell more than 2 in new york the s p 500 was down 1 6 with stocks of companies whose sales are dependent on china especially susceptible wynn resorts which operates casinos in the gambling haven of macao a special administrative region of china dropped more than 8 the virus and its attendant unknowns conjured memories of another deadly illness that began in china the 2002 03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which killed nearly 800 people in many ways it looks similar said nicholas r lardy a china expert and senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington we are seeing fast increases in the number of cases the hospitals are overwhelmed and are not even able to test people with symptoms i m expecting the cases to go way way up in the end sars significantly slowed the chinese economy dropping the annual growth rate to 9 1 in the second quarter of 2003 from 11 1 in the previous quarter according to oxford economics an independent research institute in london advertising the episode is coinciding with the lunar new year a major holiday in which hundreds of millions of chinese journey to their hometowns to visit relatives with air rail and road links in central china restricted as the government seeks to block the spread of the virus hotels restaurants and other tourism related businesses are likely to suffer some economists assume that those effects will quickly dissipate leading to a revival in the consumer economy within months that is how events played out in 2003 our baseline is that it will be a fairly big impact but relatively short lived said louis kuijs the hong kong based head of asia economics at oxford economics in the hopeful view economic damage will be contained by the chinese government s aggressive response in effectively quarantining the outbreak s center wuhan a city of 11 million people and much of the surrounding area in hubei province advertising but wuhan is a hub of industry sometimes called the chicago of china intensifying the quarantine s implications for the national economy this is really unprecedented lardy said the economic effects may be much larger than sars wuhan is a major industrial city and if you re basically shutting it down it s going to have a major effect already china s government has extended the lunar new year holiday by three days through feb 2 ensuring that migrant workers will not return to their factory jobs as soon as anticipated almost certainly disrupting production suzhou a major industrial city near shanghai has extended the holiday until at least feb 8 given that china s economy is the source of roughly one third of world economic growth the slowdown could be felt widely most directly china s neighbors would absorb the effects especially those dependent on tourists from china among them hong kong the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam over the weekend china announced that it was barring overseas group tours by its citizens if china s factories are hobbled by additional restrictions on transportation that limit factory production that could become a global event it could hit iron ore mines in australia and india that feed raw materials into china s smelters it could limit sales of computer chips and glass panel displays made at plants in malaysia and south korea advertising it could trim sales of factory machinery produced in germany and auto parts made in the czech republic hungary and poland it could even affect the purchases of additional american farm goods that china agreed to under the trade deal signed this month the shock is hitting just as china contends with its slowest pace of economic growth in decades reviving fears that its reduced appetite for the goods and services of the world could jeopardize jobs on multiple shores china is obviously slowing down in a structural way said silvia dall angelo senior economist at hermes investment management in london the global economy is clearly more shaky with sluggish growth it is clearly more vulnerable to shocks the sars outbreak prompted the government to stimulate the chinese economy by directing surges of credit that financed huge infrastructure projects but whatever damage china confronts this time its willingness to respond will be limited by the government s concerns about mounting public debt they are much more constrained now said lardy the china expert i think people underestimate the conviction that the top leadership has that they really want to reduce financial risk but as global investors try to gauge the outlook one element is the same as ever in china information is scarce trust in the authorities is minimal advertising during the sars outbreak the government was slow to acknowledge the existence of the virus as local officials actively covered up cases allowing the threat to multiply this time the government has sought to project the sense that it is forthrightly reckoning with the crisis president xi jinping has publicly acknowledged the threat while warning local officials not to hide reports of trouble but in the current moment of agitation any perceived lack of information tends to weigh in as bad news this is of course still a government system where transparency is not really held up as an important criterion kuijs of oxford economics said this is still an overall system in which discretionary decisions by bureaucrats are driving everything instead of very clear rules

guest column learnmore zuze zimbabweans in particular and the world in general clearly can t find confidence in the zanu pf governance system the enduring crisis in zimbabwe presents a conundrum to many people to the generality of zimbabweans whose only desire is simply the pursuit of a dignified existence the debilitating liquidity crunch foreign currency shortages rising inflation spiralling basic commodity prices erosion of disposable incomes power outages and low productivity are a weight unbearable to carry retrospectively inclusive of the robert mugabe era it would be enormously accurate to say that zimbabwe has shifted from one crisis to another for nearly two decades now twenty years of skills flight and economic instability are a long time of suffering it is for this reason that zimbabweans seem to have resigned to fate to the extent of shunning the stayaways that always result in loss of lives and property zimbabweans passionately loathe the situation in their country but clearly do not have the wherewithal to alter it they are or rather have always existed in a survival mode they are going with the tide of a catastrophe they cannot decipher zimbabweans born around 1999 are moving into adulthood having grown under the cloud of economic uncertainty the zimbabwean political and economic tragedy has become a definition of zimbabwean life advertisement while it is easier to understand the zimbabwean crisis in terms of how it presents itself through the economy it is profoundly critical to realise that the zimbabwean tragedy is squarely traceable to the politics of the day this self evident truth was reflective of the mugabe zanu pf and morgan tsvangirayi mdc political feud which culminated in the government of national unity gnu in 2009 in any set up no economic progress can occur in the presence of a political crisis today zimbabwe finds herself caught up in the exact situation where the economic crisis is nothing but a silhouette of the terrible political problems bedevilling the nation the current government has gone around the world on an offensive to win international confidence the bretton woods institution among many other monetary institutions with the potential to assist have been engaged towards extinguishing a colossal us 18 6 million debt and accessing new lines of credit from other financial institutions as things stand a raft of measures including direct threats to businesses operating in the country and the austerity measures have been topical in an attempt to contain the revolting economy with little success banning of the use of the united states dollar has not stopped the public from using it liberalising of fuel imports has not tamed the ever growing fuel queues in the country it appears the more efforts are made to control the damage the more the damage occurs this simply points to one thing zimbabwean problems indicate something deeply wrong with politics without pulling punches the real key to unlocking the situation in zimbabwe is to start by fixing the politics of the country as long as nothing happens in the way of both political and economic reforms then the country still has miles to go it is a given that one of the worst things to happen to the present administration is failure to win confidence of the zimbabweans in particular and the world in general for example it is an open secret that zimbabweans have plenty of foreign currency stashed in different places in their homes as they mistrust taking it to banks history has contributed to this apprehension people remain sceptical of taking their hard currency to banks in order to get the bond notes it is simply a question of lack of confidence in the government by zimbabweans the forex reserves held by people probably run into millions but an apparent lack of confidence in the system is feeding the crisis coming to how confidence of the international community has been harmed there really is no secret america was honest enough to tell the zimbabwean government that it needed to fulfil some tough conditions including political and electoral reforms accountability for past atrocities and compensation for white farmers who lost their land under mugabe s land reform programme among others the us even went further clearly highlighting that it was urgent that the soldiers who killed protesters in the august 1 2018 post election demonstrations be made to account we may debate theories postulate and pontificate about the economic malaise in zimbabwe but the untainted truth is that massive changes have to occur within the broader politics of the country it must be clearly mastered that a simplistic view in mending the economy is self defeating fixing the zimbabwean crisis is not as easy as picking an alternative currency like the rand or pula in the absence of production where almost everything has to be imported coupled with an archaic industrial infrastructure then no economy can be revamped it sounds rather trite yet it is the truth about the zimbabwean crisis only when the essential political problems are adequately addressed can the international confidence return zimbabwe is a country of massive potential but remains trapped in an economic paralysis whose major panacea is simply the return of confidence in the presiding government like this like loading

president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs
