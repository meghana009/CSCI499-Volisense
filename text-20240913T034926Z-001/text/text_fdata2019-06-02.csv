the tariff truce came to an abrupt end via presidential tweets on may 3 until those tweets us officials had been indicating that progress was being made and there was hope that at the sidelines of the g20 meeting that trump and xi would agree on a trade deal the end of the tariff truce marked a turning point in the markets risk appetites were reduced equities and yields fell the dollar eased in the first half of may as renewed trade tensions were understood as increasing the likelihood that the federal reserve would cut interest rates the greenback recovered in the second half of the month with the notable exceptions of the japanese yen and swiss franc as the still wide interest rate differentials and idea that the us is best prepared to weather escalating trade conflict ahead of the imposition of china s retaliatory tariffs on june 1 and as just as the process seeking ratification of the new north american free trade agreement has begun president trump surprised the world by claimed emergency powers and imposed a 5 tariff effective june 10 that could gradually rise to 25 at the start of q4 unless mexico tightens up its border controls there are likely to be far reaching even if unintended consequences for mexico the outlook for monetary policy and as an alternative for those seeking to move facilities from china and the us economy and future trade negotiation the current trajectory would put a 25 tariff on all the goods from the two countries that are the largest source of us imports and a 25 tariff on all car imports shades of smoot hawley the local elections proved disastrous for the uk tories at the beginning of the month and their performance in the eu parliament elections was not better prime minister may finally succumbed to pressure resigning before the results of the eu parliament elections were announced the risk off environment that followed the end of the tariff truce plus the heightened risks that may s successor would increase the risk of a no deal exit weighed sterling sterling fell nearly six cents over the course of the month and fell almost every day against the euro after trump s twitter storm on may 5 the june ecb june 6 and federal reserve june 19 meetings are among the month s highlights although neither central bank is expected to announce new initiatives both with present updated forecasts the ecb will also provide some more details of its new targeted long term refinancing operation tltro meanwhile the gap between the fed s declaratory policy patience wait and see and the market which is aggressively pricing in a rate cut before the end of the year has rarely been more stark the chinese yuan s 2 6 decline against the dollar in may unwound the lion s share of its gains for the year the fall however is not a reflection of officials seeking to offset the tariff effects in word and deed chinese officials have been tempering the yuan s decline and warning against speculators owing to interdependency and limited alternatives we argue that it is difficult for china to use the yuan s exchange rate its holdings of us treasuries or its dominance in rare earth minerals to use as leverage against the us due to the costs involved we identify them as possible measures at a much higher level of the escalation ladder dollar backed by the highest interest rates among high income economies the us dollar is higher against all the major currencies but the yen and canadian dollar so far in the first half of 2019 there is little doubt among economists that the us economy slowed markedly in q2 but this follows the overshoot in q1 at the same time market based measures of inflation expectations e g the five year five year forward and 10 year break even have fallen around 20 bp in may fed officials will likely see the tariffs as equivalent to a tax hike rather than focus on the resulting higher prices we still only a slim chance that trump and xi will meet on the sidelines of the g20 meeting the rhetoric was still rising as may ended the us has given europe and japan until late november to limited auto exports and this cast a cloud over the bilateral negotiations however unlike the new nafta agreement the negotiations with japan and europe are executive agreements which do not need congressional approval euro following the stronger than expected q1 us gdp reported on april 26 the euro recorded a low of almost 1 11 speculators sold into the euro s bounce and the single currency came back and made a marginal new low drawing even closer to 1 11 the news has already been discounted

developed market outlook trade concerns set the tone amid nfp global pmis and the ecb this week saw the risk off market undertone deteriorate further as president of the united states donald trump turned his sights to mexican tariffs threatening to slap 5 duties on goods from early june with tariffs set to rise by 5 increments to a maximum of 25 by october in a bid to pressure the mexican government to crack down on illegal migrants across the us mexico border further compounding the risk averse market theme reports on friday confirmed that china have a major retaliative plan to restrict us access to rare earth materials in a bid to gain some leverage in further us china trade negotiations whenever they may be friday s under forecast chinese manufacturing pmi did little to alleviate concerns of a global economic slowdown with purchasing managers index falling back into contraction territory 49 4 after tentative signs of an uptick in activity buoyed the index back into expansion territory over the previous two months in such an environment the safe haven japanese yen has excelled pushing higher against all major peers the swiss franc chf has also been supported as investors seek out safe haven assets to weather the current market turbulence the new zealand australian and canadian dollars all headed into the weekend on the back foot with the loonie in particular weighed by friday s 1 drop in the price of oil similarly the commodity linked norwegian krone looked set to see out the week down against both the single currency and us dollar however bearing the brunt of the unexpected tariff announcement the mexican peso was obliterated over the course of friday s session with the peso to dollar exchange rate last seen down 2 69 at a four month low the british pound remained under intense downside pressure as political risks in the uk around brexit intensified with eurosceptic tory lawmakers queuing round the block to replace prime minister theresa may when she steps down in june markets have subsequently priced for elevated no deal brexit odds looking ahead to next week concerns over global trade prospects will remain the major market theme as investors await mexico s response to tariff man s proposed hikes and further details on china s next move while trump may have written the art of the deal his aggressive negotiating tactics have thus far failed to prompt capitulation from either mexico or china with economists warning of the far reaching economic repercussions for both the involved parties and global economic health overall a multi front trade war could yield if we consider that mexico exports over 350 billion to the united states retaliation to the measures by mexico would be off the charts said mexico s former chief nafta negotiator kevin smith advertisement this news does leave the world wondering whether trump s use of tariffs could become ever broader this is a step change as previously we had been seeing delays in trade related decisions on europe and japan as we thought the administration was so focused on china wrote global chief economist at standard chartered david mann adding it does add to the reasons to worry that any country running a trade surplus with the u s could come into the spotlight in the future us dollar usd eyes on trade nfp this week saw the inversion of the us treasury yield curve back on the agenda with analysts debating the efficacy of this as a leading indicator of an incipient recession despite the inversion some analysts remain pessimistic about the potential of an imminent recession striking the world s largest economy we think markets are getting a bit ahead of themselves when pricing in a recession in the us over the next couple of years the dataflow has remained solid so far and that should be the general trend over the coming week wrote ing economists adding that said we don t think friday s key jobs report will cause a massive rethink among investors in terms of the dataflow friday saw the latest pce price index release the fed s preferred method of inflation print an on target 0 2 while federally compiled personal spending and income

rate is tipped to remain at the multi year low of 3 6 despite relatively robust data markets continue to grow pessimistic on the us outlook with current pricing reflecting a 70 probability for a quarter point cut to us interest rates by september of this year ing economists were more upbeat although they noted the risks revolving around trade we don t expect the fed to follow through with the rate cuts that markets are now pricing in although a lot depends on trade trade tensions are growing and markets will be watching next week to see if a trump is inching closer to placing tariffs on the remaining basket of chinese goods and b if china is gearing up for further non tariff retaliation they wrote euro eur pmis cpi and the ecb while this week has been relatively light on the data

warrant service sector pmis on wednesday will be followed on thursday by german industrial output figures with the total value of new purchase orders placed with manufacturers forecast to moderate to

by w a wijewardena delivering the first memorial oration of the late a s jayawardena in colombo last week the incumbent central bank governor dr indrajit coomaraswamy emphasised the need for institutionalising the macroeconomic policy being presently pursued by the bank in order to make it sustainable he spoke on creating frameworks for macroeconomic policy making and institutionalising them to achieve sustained improvement in macroeconomic fundamentals before an audience of asj s contemporaries colleagues admirers and students asj a man for all seasons asj was a career central banker but he was much more than that he wore many hats simultaneously during his career spanning for more than five decades he lent his academic wisdom to students at the old vidyodaya university as a visiting lecturer in late 1960s that was where i first met him not as a top economist but as a versatile teacher he was an advisor to the newly formed ministry of plantation industries in early 1970s advising the minister on how best the resources belonging to the nationalised plantation sector could be utilised then for a short period he was handpicked by the government to head the country s largest commercial bank bank of ceylon as its general manager many years later he functioned as its chairman too he was a top bureaucrat in the government first as the secretary to the ministry of industries and later as secretary to the ministry of finance his longest outside involvement happened to be at the international monetary fund as its alternative executive director looking after the interests of india sri lanka bangladesh and bhutan asj used to telling us that imf was his fourth university after peradeniya london and harvard helping him to refine his economic thoughts on modern lines but his main career was at the central bank where he rose from a junior staff officer to senior deputy governor before he was elevated as its governor in late 1995 he held that post till 2004 successfully going through many calamities which the country as well as the bank had to face during that period converting adversity to prosperity when the bank was destroyed by an ltte bomb in january 1996 instead of lamenting over it he used the opportunity to reform the bank on modern lines his motto was that if phoenix the mythical bird in ancient greek mythology could rise from ashes so could the bank he in fact saw to it i have analysed asj s contributions to sri lanka in these numerous capacities in a series of articles to ft and other media and interested readers could have access to them via the links provided in the box on this page macro stability restoring the macroeconomic fundamentals in sri lanka s economy was something which ran through asj s blood hence coomaraswamy as the incumbent governor of the bank was the best to do justice to him and the title of his oration was both apt and opportune sri lanka in a historical setting to understand sri lanka s current economic problems and identify what it should do to overcome them in the future it is useful to place the country in a historical setting at the time of independence in 1948 sri lanka was a promising economy in south asia with capacity to win the economic race along with even a war ravaged nation like japan but over the years while other comparable countries in east asia moved forward faster sri lanka slipped away from them relegating itself to the common category known as a developing country while there were many reasons for this coomaraswamy diagnosed macroeconomic issues called macroeconomic stress by economists as the prime causal factor for this sad fate of the country according to him from 1948 to 1977 the macroeconomic stress was generated by three basic developments one was the declining export prices compared to rising or stagnant import prices known as unfavourable terms of trade another was the inability of the country to generate sufficient resources to continue with the liberal social welfare measures like free education and free healthcare system the third was the dwindling the revenue base of the government in a background of ballooning consumption expenditure programs loss of real income due to unfavourable terms of trade of these causal factors the worsening terms of trade need further elaboration sri lanka had long depended on the export of tea rubber and coconut to earn the needed foreign exchange to pay for its imports however when the export prices fell compared to those of imports requiring the country to use more export units to buy a unit of imports a situation known as unfavourable terms of trade the economic consequences of this development were twofold first it made the real welfare level of sri lankans lower than the real output they had produced because that output could buy a lesser amount of import goods it is like you work harder every year but get paid less so that the real basket of goods that you can have is also smaller second the widening trade gap and the consequential deficit in the balance of payments ate up the country s vast foreign exchange reserves which it had inherited from the british when the rupee came under pressure for devaluation it was sought to be corrected by imposing a stringent regime of import and exchange controls further adding to the macroeconomic stress in my view the failure to address this issue appropriately was the reason for the other two macroeconomic ailments identified by coomaraswamy in his oration a fiscal sector in stress after 1977 according to coomaraswamy the out of the shape fiscal sector was the main trigger point for macroeconomic stress in the country while revenue continued to fall as a percent of gdp expenditure was built up by rising defence expenses and salary and pension payments to an expanded public sector since the savings within the economy was insufficient to meet the investments the country had to borrow in increasing amounts in each successive year the result was the need for using almost the entirety of the government revenue to pay interest and repay the principal of the borrowings by the government since new borrowings had to be made to service the old borrowings and finance new investments it added to the debt stock year after year changing the country s debt dynamics to its disadvantage while the fast growing east asian economies had done the opposite sri lanka emerged as a major macroeconomic spoiler this was manifested according to coomaraswamy by several highs that can be attributed to sri lanka high budget deficit high inflation high nominal interest rates and high valued exchange rate all are connected to each other the result was the emergence of two deficits as the ailment in the macroeconomy the high budget deficit in the fiscal sector and the high current account deficit in the external sector if anyone is interested in taking the stress out of the economy these are the two ailments that have to be cured unfortunately both are outside the purview and the scope of the central bank and come within the legitimate economic policy obligations of the government ailing sri lanka s economy today coomaraswamy was very frank about the present state of sri lanka s economy economic growth has been falling continuously since 2013 reaching a record low level of 3 2 in 2018 while foreign exchange reserves have been dwindling in the recent past the potential growth in 2019 has been 5 but the estimates made by both the central bank and imf have been below that recording a widened output gap both have contributed to put pressure on sri lanka rupee to depreciate in the market the situation has been aggravated by the bunching of the repayment of foreign debt in 2019 a legacy of resorting to foreign borrowings in the past to bridge the country s resource gap though the impact of the recent bomb blasts and religious clashes has not been precisely measured coomaraswamy was of the opinion that the reduction in the aggregate demand due to the loss of income should compress the actual growth in 2019 in the external sector though the recent clashes did not cause a sudden panic among the foreign investors there had been continuous capital outflow from the country the rupee depreciated by 16 in 2018 against the us dollar but after that correction was made its further depreciation has been contained in fact the rupee has appreciated by a little more than 3 so far in 2019 over its level at end 2018 in the case of foreign exchange reserves even if a worst case scenario is assumed there will be sufficient official foreign exchange reserves to meet the foreign debt repayment obligations measures implemented to attain macroeconomic stability coomaraswamy then elaborated on the measures which the central bank has already taken or propose to take in the immediate future to acquire foreign funding to build the country s foreign exchange reserves in this regard the traditional source for sri lanka had been borrowing from international markets in us dollar denominated international sovereign bonds ever since sri lanka began to tap this market in 2007 there had been many issues of international sovereign bonds by the country in the last 12 year period even in 2019 the central bank on the request of the government tapped this market to raise funds for the government now the bank is proposing to diversify its commercial borrowings into swap facilities with india china and qatar in addition sovereign bonds will be issued in japanese yen in the form of samurai bonds and in chinese yuan in panda bonds the major breakthrough proposed is to borrow from international markets on the strength of the credit worthiness of the world bank coomaraswamy revealed that bank s policy based guarantee or pbg facility is being studied in the central bank at present in order to borrow from international markets on the strength of aaa credit rating given to the world bank if successful this would enable sri lanka to borrow at about 2 compared to present borrowing rate of 6 7 however a caveat is the need for introducing a policy package acceptable to the bank long term stability depends on restructuring the economy these measures will surely help sri lanka to generate foreign exchange funds to repay its existing loans this is also what the central bank could do as the fiscal agent of the government but this solution is temporary enabling sri lanka to overcome the most pressing problem of the day namely how to meet the foreign exchange obligations on account of the debt repayment and continuing with the import program in this regard the permanent and long term solution does not rely on foreign borrowing and repaying the country s foreign debt or paying for imports the long term solution is to restructure the country s economy giving more priority to investments in sectors that would help the country to earn more foreign exchange by mobilising funds by borrowing from the international markets the central bank has done its job now it is the government s job to take measures to influence the real sector of the economy to produce more without such a long term policy mere borrowing from international markets to service foreign debt and pay for imports will only increase the country s indebtedness no country or an individual can live forever by borrowing for is needs without working it will push sri lanka back to the vicious circle of macroeconomic stress which it is trying to avoid sustaining policy is a challenge since sri lanka is characterised by policy changes whenever the government changes or whenever a new person assumes leadership even within the same government good policies adopted by the central bank have no permanent existence this happened when the political power changed from unp to upf in 2004 the previous government had agreed to replace the monetary law act with a new central banking act and repeal the old banking act and introduce a financial services institution act however the government that came to power in 2004 did not think it necessary and shelved both draft legislations hence it is essential to institutionalise the good macroeconomic stability work which the central bank has done coomaraswamy devoted the last part of his oration to emphasise this need already an asset and liability management act has been enacted permitting the central bank to raise funds outside the appropriations approved by parliament whenever the market is conducive to do so and keep them without transferring to the government in order to repay public debt that is to bunch in a given year this has been strengthened by a medium term debt management strategy that enables the central bank to use available unused space to issue debt on behalf of the government to give strength to the flexible inflation targeting program by making the bank independent from fiscal dominance a new monetary law act is said to be presented to parliament for approval soon these are the institutional improvements that have been already implemented or earmarked to be implemented in the near future they would certainly make macroeconomic stability measures sustainable but do not assure it since the present government cannot make unchangeable rules for future governments that should come from political consensus building and that is completely outside the purview of the central bank w a wijewardena a former deputy governor of the central bank can be reached at waw1949

first a review of last week s events eur usd president trump decided to shake up the markets once again putting chinese problems aside for the time being he turned his eyes towards mexico as he failed to build a wall on the border with it in order to stop the flow of illegal immigrants we will punish mexico with the dollar the us president decided and increased the duties on mexican made goods onwards and upwards in july the rates will be raised up to 10 in august up to 15 in september up to 20 and in october up to 25 it is not excluded that such a demonstration of power pursued a double goal in addition to the punishment of mexico city he also wants to scare beijing see what we do with the recalcitrant of course china is not mexico everything is much more complicated here but be that as it may the dollar continued to grow the results of the elections to the european parliament also played in its favor as a result the pair recorded a local low at the level of 1 1115 on thursday may 30 and ended may near the monthly pivot point at 1 1167 thus the euro weakened against the dollar by about 350 points in the first five months it is appropriate to recall that a year ago at the same time the european currency lost 2 5 times more about 900 points in just a month and a half so both traders and brokers have every reason to complain about lower volatility gbp usd after the resignation statement of prime minister theresa may and success of the brexit supporters in the elections to the european parliament the pound continues to be under pressure recall that 65 of experts supported by 90 of oscillators and trend indicators voted for the pair to fall further this was exactly what happened the pair not only went down but also updated the lows of spring 2019 reaching the bottom on the horizon 1 2557 then a rebound followed and the final chord sounded at 1 2630 usd jpy the growth of tension entails the growth of anti risk sentiment the blow struck by trump in mexico caused a collapse of almost all market assets first of all the oil price and investors have once again turned their eyes to a safe haven called the japanese yen where one can wait out the next economic storm as a result unlike the euro and the pound which fell against the dollar the yen on the contrary strengthened reaching 108 30 on friday may 31 where it met summer fully confirming the forecast given by 75 of analysts 85 of oscillators and 100 trend indicators cryptocurrencies for the third week in a row bitcoin stubbornly stepped up to the cherished 10 000 moving according to the step forward half step back scheme so having fought off the horizon of 7 880 the btc usd pair went up sharply late in the evening of sunday may 26 reaching 8 955 on monday then a correction of 5 5 followed and one more spurt upwards as a result of which it was seen at the height of 9 100 however it failed to gain a foothold above 9 000 the bulls began to fix their profits and bitcoin said goodbye to the spring at 8 510 having risen in price by more than 120 for these three months as for the pairs eth usd ltc usd and xrp usd both ethereum and litecoin as well as ripple after growth following the reference cryptocurrency returned to the mid may values by the end of the working week as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd in addition to us president trump the main engines of this pair are the us federal reserve and the ecb recall that the current head of the european central bank mario draghi leaves office on october 31 the main contender for his chair now is jens weidmann who being a supporter of a strong euro actively supports the increase in interest rates representatives of the fed by contrast hint at a possible reduction in the dollar rate due to a possible slowdown in the us gdp such a situation should presumably play in favor of the euro however according to bloomberg the ecb will begin to raise the rate no earlier than april 2020 and during this time a lot can change moreover the political and economic problems of the eurozone can be observed already now based on the above 60 of experts supported by graphical analysis on d1 vote for the pair to fall to support 1 0975 the next target is 100 points lower most indicators also look to the south 50 of them are colored red 25 are green and 25 are neutral gray supporters of bulls are currently in the minority in their opinion the pair will not be able to break through support in the 1 1100 zone and it can reach the height of 1 1265 1 1325 on the rebound now the events of the coming week which are worth paying attention to on monday june 3 we are waiting for the publication of business activity indices in the eurozone the united states and china and on tuesday for the data on inflation and unemployment in the eurozone thursday june 6 will also be filled with news from europe these are data on gdp the ecb decision on interest rates and most importantly the ecb press conference on monetary policy and finally as usual we will see the publication of statistics on the us labor market on the first friday of the month experts expect that the nfp may fall by about 30 from 263k to 190k which will weaken the dollar for a while gbp usd the main contender for the post of british prime minister today is the former mayor of london and foreign minister boris johnson and this is bad for the pound since johnson is a supporter of the tough brexit and exit from the eu without a deal such an outcome scares the market and today 65 of experts supported by 90 of oscillators and 100 of trend indicators on d1 expect the british currency to weaken further and the fall of the pair first to support 1 2555 and then to the 2018 lows 1 2475 and 1 2405 the remaining 35 of analysts believe that the pair s behavior over the past two weeks is a precursor to a strong correction as a result of which it can return to the height of 1 2745 or even reach the resistance of 1 2825 a compromise is offered by graphical analysis on d1 according to its readings the pair can first rise to the level of 1 2825 and then turning around find the bottom in the zone of 1 2405 1 2475 usd jpy despite the fact that 100 of the trend indicators and 85 of the oscillators on h4 and d1 are colored red the situation is not that simple 15 of oscillators are already giving signals that the pair is being oversold support levels are 107 75 and 107 00 resistance levels are 109 15 109 65 110 35 and 110 65 as for the experts the votes were divided as follows 50 side with the bears 25 side with the bulls and 25 are at a loss in the middle whose position will be the most correct will depend on the stock markets with which the pair has a strong correlation and as usual on trump s tweets dedicated primarily to the course of the us china trade war at the same time when transitioning to the medium term forecast the situation changes radically here it is already 75 who give the palm to the dollar cryptocurrencies six years ago in 2013 an unusual message from luka magnotta from the future was published which predicted the price of bitcoin which turned out to be surprisingly accurate on average every year the cost of bitcoin increased about 10 times magnotta wrote it grew from 0 1 in 2010 to 1 in 2011 to 10 in 2012 to 100 in 2013 then there will be a slowdown and the price will increase 10 times every two years bitcoin will grow to 1 000 in 2015 to 10 000 in 2017 to 100 000 in 2019 and to 1 000 000 in 2021 there are still seven months until the end of 2019 or is it just seven months in any case this cryptocurrency must demonstrate a fantastic growth in order to achieve the goal set by magnotta as for the shorter term forecast a well known analyst peter brandt has expressed an opinion that driven by the fomo fear of missing out syndrome of numerous traders the price of bitcoin will soon overcome the mark of 10 000 at the same time brandt stresses that a rather deep correction is not far off the bulls will certainly want to take profits and this sale will stop buyers trying to jump into the leaving train unlike brandt most analysts 70 have set a more modest goal for the btc usd pair to consolidate above 9 000 the remaining 30 believe that the pair will take a breather and will move in the side channel 7 500 8 500 in conclusion of this forecast it should be noted that the time of its writing is friday 24 00 gmt and it is possible that it is the upcoming weekend as it happened more than once that the bulls will once again move bitcoin quotes up

london cnn business 1 escalating threats president donald trump s threat to impose tariffs on all imports from mexico isn t more of the same it plunges the relationship between the united states and its second largest supplier of imports into jeopardy it leaves exposed the significant number of global businesses that move goods across the border and the 5 tax tied to mexico s ability to halt the movement of undocumented immigrants into the united states looks like it could go into effect on june 10 that s soon for investors the president s announcement via twitter on thursday which said tariffs could eventually rise to 25 came as a complete surprise the threat of tariffs on mexico was completely off the market s radar said cliff hodge director of investments at cornerstone wealth group no one has been talking about tariffs on mexico that changed friday the dow plunged 355 points or 1 4 as investors agonized over the latest tariff threats the s p 500 and nasdaq fell too markets had already been roiled by the re escalation of the trade war between the united states and china even before the president mentioned new duties on mexico the dow had been on track for its sixth consecutive weekly decline its longest streak of that kind since june 2011 it hit that mark friday the china problem isn t going away beijing increased tariffs on 60 billion worth of us goods last week in retaliation for the latest hike from the united states talks are at a standstill and china is now making very clear that it could pull american businesses into the fray but proposed tariffs on mexico differ from the tariffs on chinese exports in two important ways multinational companies have for decades relied on the ability to freely transport goods between the united states and mexico more than two thirds of trade from mexico consists of exchanges between us companies and their subsidiaries according to a us government report from 2017 should that change they ll be in big trouble the united states could be looking at an earnings recession that could flow through to an economic recession hodge said the most vulnerable sector in this case is autos the industry imported 59 4 billion in parts from mexico last year according to us government trade data finished cars and trucks also come into the united states from mexico about 2 7 million autos were imported from mexico last year worth 52 billion according to the us commerce department tariffs are not a cost automakers are prepared to bear the global nature of auto production makes the sector particularly vulnerable to an increase in tariffs fitch ratings chief economist brian coulton and analyst pawel borowski said in report this week besides global vehicle sales have already been softening with demand falling in key markets that means that automakers will be hesitant to pass the costs on to consumers and could be forced to take a greater hit themselves the second reason that tariffs on mexico are a big threat is that they could derail a key trade agreement investors had assumed that the usmca which replaces the north american free trade agreement between the united states canada and mexico was on track for implementation but it requires low tariffs on products traded by its signatories and it has not yet been approved by congress analysts at goldman sachs said in a research note friday that if the tariffs take effect the usmca is less likely to be ratified before the 2020 election that would certainly spook markets which are only now starting to price in that risk and it could make china think twice about striking a new trade deal with the united states after seeing how easily it could be torn up it will cause them to question whether it makes sense to make a deal with this administration if they are willing to use tariffs for other strategic issues later said chris zaccarelli chief investment officer for independent advisor alliance 2 ecb time the european central bank will hold its june meeting as the situation on trade continues to deteriorate and the race to find a replacement for president mario draghi heats up analysts expect the central bank to outline details on additional cheap loans for banks while maintaining historically low interest rates we expect a dovish draghi who emphasizes that the ecb is continuing to reassess the outlook and stands ready to use all instruments bank of america merrill lynch analysts said in a recent note 3 jobs jobs jobs america s booming labor market may have nowhere to go but down the may jobs report out this friday is expected to show that us payroll growth decelerated to 190 000 jobs in may according to a reuters survey of economists that would mark a slowdown from april s surge of 263 000 however adding that many jobs would still represent very healthy growth especially given that unemployment is sitting at a 49 year low of 3 6 wages gains are expected to be flat at about 3 2 year over year a clean bill of health from the jobs report could ease wall street s concerns about slowing economic growth 4 india us trade the trump administration added another country to its trade policy overhaul on friday announcing it would end preferential trade treatment for india on june 5 the move effectively ends tariff exemptions on indian goods worth over 5 billion in a statement trump said india had not done

against mexico make a fed rate cut before year end more likely in our view the us economy has already passed an inflection point so that we now believe the fed s next rate move will anyway be a 25 basis points quarter point rate cut in early 2020 while the us economy maintains moderate momentum backed by a strong jobs market and still elevated private sector confidence the effects of the earlier fiscal stimulus are rapidly dissipating and trade tensions represent a serious downside risk we expect the fed will maintain its patient approach through 2019 but with output growth slowing faster than it currently forecasts and inflation undershooting its target an interest rate cut will become unavoidable our view remains that us growth will gradually slow from 2 9 in 2018 to 1 6 in

increasingly difficult trade war with china and now likely mexico the move was driven by breakevens and term premium which suggests that flight to quality convexity and month end extension also likely played a role nevertheless we have come a long way we are pricing in one 25bp cut by sep 19 and about 90bp of cuts by end 2020 the market is very pessimistic about the growth momentum and the impact of tariffs note that tariffs can take a while to show up in the data due to stock piling and margin absorption further we don t think that the fed can be pre emptive and cut rates without signs of

year the world bank report said friday may 31 was an interesting day in indian politics and economics on the economics front q4gdp numbers plunged to a 20 quarter low while annual growth came to a five year low of 6 8 per cent however despite much scepticism india could stick to its fiscal deficit of 3 4 per cent for fy19 bank credit growth declined by rs 1 5 lakh crore in april but this has always been a seasonal phenomenon on the political front the country got its first woman finance minister pm indira gandhi did hold the portfolio but that was only as an additional charge in 72 years domestic growth was even weaker than what was expected manufacturing gva which grew by 12 1 per cent in q1 decelerated sharply growing by 3 1 per cent in q4 this was expected based on the q4 fy19 results of 932 listed corporates around 550 companies had reported either negative or single digit revenue growth for fy19 manufacturing gva grew by 6 9 per cent compared to 5 9 per cent in fy18 core gva an indicator of private demand slowed down to 6 1 per cent the lowest since q2fy18 agriculture and allied activities grew at 2 9 per cent in fy19 compared to last year s growth of 5 9 per cent in q4 the sector registered a negative growth of 0 1 per cent however the good thing was that the agricultural price deflator an indicator of rural purchasing power has finally recovered in q4 after two successive quarters of de growth in fact our estimates suggest that since the msp increase in july 18 wholesale prices of 18 major crops includes cereals pulses and oil seeds have recovered from lows and are now on average 10 per cent higher than the msp however such rise in mandi prices has no material impact on retail food inflation which seems to have declined even as wholesale inflation has moved up the divergence is a matter of debate but low inflation now seems entrenched in india s psyche advertisement in this context the government decision to now extend the pm kisan scheme to all farmers is a positive step we also did some rough estimates to find out the fiscal cost of such an ambitious programme over the next five years our calculations suggest that even if we progressively increase the income support from say rs 6 000 to rs 8 000 in the terminal year inflation indexed and reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent in 2024 with a nominal gdp growth of around 11 5 per cent the additional cost for 14 crore farmers over the baseline estimates could be rs 12 000 crore per annum same as the revised estimates if only rs 6 000 was provided to all 14 crore during the next five years we need a definitive consumption push in rural areas the figures on the expenditure side of gdp do not foretell a promising picture the decline in private final consumption expenditure is a matter of concern though an increase in government final consumption expenditure has been able to offset it after reaching a high growth of 9 8 per cent in q2 fy19 pfce growth declined to 7 4 per cent in q4 the growth in gross fixed capital formation dipped to 3 6 per cent in q4fy19 which is the lowest in the last eight quarters it seems that election uncertainties have taken a toll on investment and government spending on the fiscal front the latest data shows that the government has been able to meet the revised fiscal deficit estimate of 3 4 per cent of the gdp however there has been a rs 1 45 lakh crore reduction in expenditure with a rs 69 140 crore cut in subsidies majorly food subsidy covering for rs 1 57 lakh crore reduction in total receipts now that fy19 estimates are revised the fy20 be may be on the higher side the problem is that global uncertainties have compounded in recent times tax cuts by the us did not have much impact on its growth last year and going forward there is not much room for further support world trade growth is likely to remain weak into the second quarter of 2019 the latest world trade outlook indicator wtoi remains well below the baseline value of 100 for the index signaling continued falling trade growth in the first half of 2019 the outlook for trade could worsen further if heightened trade tensions are not resolved or if macroeconomic policy fails to adjust to changing circumstances for example the ongoing trade skirmish between usa and china is showing no signs of abating with the us increasing tariffs on chinese products china in retaliation has said that it will raise tariffs on 60 billion worth of us imports starting june 1 there are even concerns about the tariff war spilling over to financial markets in the form of china cutting its exposure to the us treasury market worsening economic indicators in the us like student loan delinquency and yield curve inversion the worst since 2007 as well as us exports getting squeezed by trade wars are also going to pose challenges for the us economy advertisement given the growth slowdown that the country is facing the question arises whether the government should continue to focus on the path of fiscal consolidation or keep deficit numbers constant for the next two years at 3 4 per cent or keep it marginally higher before reducing it as growth revives we believe that the government should target a structural deficit as an alternative to targeting the fiscal deficit like most advanced and several emerging economies this serves as an automatic counter cyclical stabiliser unlike the current target that has been set from the outset as a fixed percentage of gdp and is a statistical misnomer but for sure fiscal policy should be transparent and credible and we must strive for what we can achieve through resource mobilisation and not through expenditure compression we also expect monetary policy support to complement fiscal policy in the interregnum the rbi could also advise banks for effective rate transmission the sbi has proactively moved to external benchmarking of the repo rate to lending rates there is no harm in replicating this we end on a positive note recently s p global ratings upgraded indonesia s sovereign rating to bbb from bbb just after the re election of president joko widodo strong economic growth prospects low debt an infrastructure drive of more than 400 billion and prudent fiscal policy enabled the upgrade india has also seen the re election of the modi government with an even larger mandate uncanny similarity

dwight bullard former member florida senate political director the new florida majority last week the robert mueller press conference was again a reiteration of how far down the rabbit hole we have gone as a country in terms of our politics in the 1970 s as the country was gripped by the watergate hearings we witnessed a presidency brought down because a sitting president acknowledged that he knew of an illegal act being committed and actively chose to cover up that acknowledgement richard nixon became the first president to resign from office rather than face removal by congress here we are in 2019 with an investigation that concluded that the president of the united states attempted on multiple occasions to commit illegal acts only to me undermined by people who did not want to follow through with those acts all while a foreign country admitted to election tampering with no condemnation by the current administration that is now documented and on the record yet we have a congress that seems to view impeachment as some mythical thing that cannot be done if this were the plot of a movie you might consider this absurd but this is literally our current reality looking ahead i don t know if the millions of residents that call south florida home are aware but miami will be hosting the first nationally televised democratic presidential debate that means that over 20 individual vying to unseat the president will be in our backyard trying to convince a national audience that they are the best candidate to take the democratic nomination and beat donald trump you can also expect many of these men and women to host town halls fundraisers and meet and greets while they are in town as a veteran of far to many campaign cycles what will trouble me from now until november 2020 are how many people i will encounter that will tell me i don t know who s running i can t speak for the other 350 million americans but for the millions of my neighbors here in south florida here s your chance to get to know people face to face please take the time over the next few weeks to research who these people are so that when you see them at your local coffee shop you can ask them the important questions that are on your mind
is another recession real or imagined with fears rife over an imminent global economic recession experts have expressed mixed feelings on how it may affect nigeria s economy already suffering a lot of headwinds report ibrahim apekhade yusuf and medinat kanabe as nigeria immune from the impending global financial crisis as accentuated by the trade wars between the two major economic powers including the usa and china are the fears about a global meltdown as experienced a decade ago founded are there ominous signs the foregoing questions are some of the worries that have preoccupied the minds of well meaning nigerians in the last couple of days now indeed with the latent fears over another imminent global economic crunch many countries of the world are preparing ahead for any eventualities while analysts have expressed mixed reactions as to the extent to which the outcome of the trade wars can adversely affect nigeria they however did not foreclose the possibility clear and present danger over recession one man who should know better is the governor of central bank of nigeria cbn godwin emefiele he spoke of fears of another recession if measures are not put in place to combat the high rate of unemployment and other economic crisis emefiele gave this hint penultimate wednesday at the university of benin while delivering a lecture titled beyond the global financial crisis monetary policy under global uncertainty according to him monetary and fiscal policy authority must be ready to challenge the situation and begin to think of what can be done to tackle the situation the cbn governor said from some of my concluding remarks you may have observed whether you like it or not there is global uncertainty that will unfortunately most certainly lead to another crisis the question could be how are we as nigerians particularly our leaders i am talking of monetary and fiscal policy authority how are we preparing our country for the next set of crisis he said we have luckily exited recession we have seen inflation pending downward to about 18 72 percent in 2017 to about 11 37 percent today we see reserve moving up exchange rate stabilizing but unfortunately we still have issue and those issues bother on unemployment rate he assured that cbn will continue to take proactive approach in mitigating the likely adverse effects that may emanate from external headwinds while the cbn governor was rather downcast in his forecast the president of the association of bureaux de change operators of nigeria abcon alhaji aminu gwadabe at the weekend was optimistic that the country was not under any risk especially of a global recession as far as i m concerned there is really no cause for alarm the forex market has been relatively stable from what we can see the economic managers have got a solid rein on the workings of the economy the new government as just been sworn in and have since hit the ground running he assured going down memory lane the abcon boss said one of the factors that helped the country from exiting recession in the past was a single exchange rate for the market ensuring that naira should not be more than n400 to a dollar and this was one of the first thing we did as an association to checkmate the spike and the weakness of the naira also as stakeholders in the market we have helped the central bank of nigeria in ensuring that people have readily foreign exchange accessibility like you said our number is about 3 500 none of the banks even have up to 1000 outlets in the entire country in lagos alone we have about 1 700 bdcs so we are all over the place ensuring liquidity right now the market is even shocked up because the parallel market rate is below the rate we are buying from the cbn we are currently buying at n358 to the dollar for working customers that come some even n355 but we are going to the cbn window at n360 to a dollar so it is even becoming impossible for people to go to cbn window and come out and sale to make margin because of the parallel market rate is even far below the selling rate of the cbn to the bdc sub sector 2019 outlook in 2019 by broad consensus of global economic institutions the world economy will slow however the issue is where and by how much reporting on this the london based magazine the economist noted that economists at investment bank jp morgan developed their model based only on the historical predictive power of the stock market credit spreads and the yield curve this implies a probability of a recession in the united states in 2019 which could be as high as 91 according to economic watchers in nigeria a lot will depend on the condition of the international oil market if the global economy slumps oil prices will come under severe pressure and rising dollar would result in oil price decline besides the experts inferred that there are strong reasons to believe that monetary conditions will tighten in the year as cbn seeks to rein in liquidity just as there are concerns that this might not be adequate to refrain the naira from falling against major foreign currencies rising food prices from low harvests as a result of the herdsmen conflict and severe floods in 2018 and the implementation of the new minimum wage are expected to increase inflationary pressures during the year which could lead to tighter monetary policy recession is a possibility in the view of mr victor ndukauba deputy managing director afrinvest west africa limited the fear of global recession is not likely but a global slowdown in growth is certain under the circumstance while making oblique reference to the trade warfare between the usa and china ndukauba said the risk is possibly driven by the us the trade wars on one hand between the us and china fighting over you know the trade balance and trade deficit and more recently the conflict between mexico and canada so i think that s the real threat to global slowdown because between the us and china these are the two countries that are responsible for nearly 40 of all trade flows and perhaps even more in terms of the global gdp on whether the risk of the global slowdown in growth is sufficient to push the global economy into a recession he said it is a possibility that might be possible but i think if you follow the top global issues though the more critical thing for us is still the domestic challenges confronting us daily raising some posers the afrinvest boss said what is the risk of the slow down on all titles positive or negative and how do we put that side by side the expectations for the conflict in the middle east and how long will the escalation in iran and the us versus north korea last for me issues are even more fundamental and they are more domestic than external while attempting a prognosis of the issues bedeviling the nation s fledging economy he said growth is at 2 or thereabouts and the security growth is very weak at 2 where our population is still growing at 2 6 2 7 so that is part of the problem with respect to an expansion in poverty what drives growth in nigeria is not so much what happens on the external sector and the best you can have is oils prices is still where it was last year which is at an average of 70 barrel or more but even with that we saw that revenue underperformed by 45 so unless something significant happens in terms of output significant output in oil volumes and that oil prices stay high we are still going to struggle in respect to revenue and there is only so much you can flog in terms of trying to get the economy to swipe as we produce the taxes pressed further he said some of the issues are more domestic than external as a government we need to look at i think the focus now has to be more on growth because that is where the real need is unemployment indices is a disaster at 26 or thereabout so we really need to address the issues and even those external developments are always the key risk factor but i think regardless we still have good examples we can draw from in africa ethiopia is doing maybe 10 and rwanda is doing something similar so i think there are pockets of excellence even despite the global headwinds as far as i m concerned there are very clear and present dangers really of a possible recession by the way a recession is officially described as two successive regimes of negative gdp flow so if you see a contraction then there is a problem when you look at the 2 gdp growth there is only really one sector that made the difference and that is the telecoms ict attracted about at 10 gdp growth every other sector hardly posed such impressive outcomes at 6 and services was more or less negative manufacturing was down those are the issues really confronting us at this point in time how usa china trade war will aid global recession there are worries that a further escalation of the trade war between the united states and china could drag the world economy into a recession according to janus henderson investors this is a potential for a near term very painful escalation of the trade tensions which could weigh on the tech sector and slow global growth said richard clode a portfolio manager on the global technology team at janus henderson i m worried about the trade war clode said at a media round table on disruption and sustainable investing in hong kong rising protectionism 25 per cent tariffs on chinese goods is going to have huge implications for the global economy and could ultimately bring us into a recession

rising trade war concerns sovereign bond yields have dropped around the developed world creating a fundamentally bullish situation for gold prices falling real yields the ig client sentiment index shows that gold prices could continue to trade higher in the days ahead see our long term forecasts for gold and other major currencies with the dailyfx trading guides gold prices week in review gold

rhetoric and policy responses the next week should be noteworthy as the long threatened 25 tariffs on 200 billion of imported chinese goods goes into effect meanwhile us president donald trump is proving that he really is a tariff man as he has threatened fresh tariffs on mexico as he seeks to push forth immigration reform efforts along the southern border of the us regardless of the efficacy of using tariffs as a tool to negotiate on immigration the fact is that the trump administration has shown a willingness to go to places that other us presidential administrations have not so it s too soon to say if these barks will result in bites with trade war concerns around the globe swirling with the us at the center there has been a steady shift towards safe haven assets like developed countries sovereign bonds in recent weeks amid a stable inflation backdrop the drop in nominal bond rates like german bunds uk gilts and us treasury yields has produced an environment of falling real

some recent economic news gives hope that the economy is less fragile than many people assumed one useful indicator of a revival of confidence by investors is the slight bounce back of the rupee s value against the dollar foreign currency markets are notoriously prone to bouts of pessimism or overconfidence and exchange rates tend to overshoot past their equilibrium values regularly so a correction was overdue another indicator is that the stock market appears to have stopped its downward slide albeit with help from government owned mutual fund companies what is still worrisome though is the fiscal deficit that is close to five percent of gdp but the upcoming budget will no doubt be addressing this issue the improvement in economic outlook is in no small measure a result of the change in the economic team for which the pti government has been pilloried as kowtowing to the imf to the critics a technocratic setup is anathema because in their view those elected to parliament are the ones mandated to govern and should therefore also be held to account for their acts of commission and omission while in positions of responsibility one must however remember that the reliance on technocrats to formulate economic policy has been the norm in most of pakistan s history for example z a bhutto appointed feroze qaiser a chartered accountant by profession as his economic adviser ziaul haq invited the eminent economist mahbubul haq to serve as the country s finance minister while benazir bhutto had v a jafarey to guide her during her two stints as prime minister musharraf s regime was chock full of technocrats including his hand picked prime minister shaukat aziz a renowned international banker the last ppp government had abdul hafeez sheikh as finance minister 2010 2013 he is now reprising his previous role in the current government in this regard at least naya pakistan is not so different from what came earlier and perhaps that s not such a bad thing either those who assail the reliance on technocrats should pay heed to the wisdom attributed to deng xiaoping the architect of china s growth miracle who said it doesn t matter whether a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice what deng essentially meant was that pragmatism should trump ideology china s growth rate over the last 40 years and its status today as the world s largest economy in purchasing power parity terms is testimony to the importance of what deng believed some part of the blame for our current economic predicament should also be placed squarely at the door of the private sector in this country for instance we are reminded time and again that the textile industry is the backbone of this country s economy and therefore deserving of all types of governmental assistance since the sector as a whole accounts for about 60 percent of pakistan s exports however past performance by the textile sector is a cause of concern and underlines weaknesses in pakistan s ability to generate sufficient foreign currency and to diversify its commodity export base according to the state bank of pakistan s statistics pakistan s annual exports of textiles and textile products in 2000 were 5 8 billion which grew to 12 9 billion by 2016 this translates into a compounded annual growth rate of 5 1 percent in comparison bangladesh which started garment manufacturing much later than pakistan exported ready made garments worth 4 9 billion in 2000 that soared to 28 1 billion in 2016 yielding a compounded annual growth rate of a stunning 11 5 percent putting each country s performance in a wider context pakistan s share of the global textile and apparel export market was 1 63 percent in 2000 and grew only marginally to 1 76 percent in 2016 bangladesh on the other hand expanded its market share from 1 38 percent in 2000 to 3 83 percent in 2016 about a three fold leap in its international market share william easterly an economics professor at new york university points out in his book the elusive quest for growth that bangladesh started its garments industry from scratch in 1979 when a bangladeshi entrepreneur teamed up with the south korean conglomerate daewoo corporation to establish desh garments desh started production of shirts for the international market in 1980 but the astonishing fact that professor easterly highlights is that the lone desh factory had directly or indirectly spawned over 700 garment manufacturers in bangladesh by 1985 as its management and workers acquired knowhow and left to set up their own businesses professor easterly attributes a large part of bangladeshi success in garment exports to the initial training provided to desh workers by daewoo which resulted in an ever widening virtuous circle of industry specific knowledge this is an instance of a massive return to investment in knowledge which thomas jefferson the principal author of the american declaration of independence and the third us president likened to a candle emitting light knowledge is like a candle even as it lights a new candle the strength of the original flame is not diminished professor easterly however puts it more prosaically knowledge leaks why pakistan s major industrial sector fell behind in comparison to bangladesh despite the fact that pakistan first entered the field of textiles in the 1950s is probably the result of a number of factors no doubt there are countless documents prepared by foreign consultants gathering dust in the various chambers of commerce and government offices however if we are to push ahead with an export led revival then the problems faced by this sector need to be comprehensively addressed through an ongoing dialogue between the private parties concerned and the government the immediate issue facing pakistan today is one of having sufficient foreign currency to make repayments of its foreign currency obligations which is why the country has turned to the imf for assistance one of the reasons for the liquidity crunch is of course the repayment of loan obligations necessitated by the projects implemented due to the china pakistan economic corridor cpec agreement cpec is undoubtedly of great benefit to the country s development as it focuses on developing the country s energy infrastructure and interconnecting the country cities through highway links but the projects inked under this agreement are for the most part long lived and therefore expected to generate benefits extending over 30 years and more anybody with an iota of business sense would recognize however that a borrower who intends to repay a loan does not borrow with the obligation to make front loaded repayments when the benefits from the project financed by that loan arise for the most part at a much later stage this is why one doubts whether any serious cost benefit analysis was done when the cpec framework agreement was initiated because the country has spent and misspent beyond its means for far too long the only alternatives to the imf loan were to a default on our international debt obligations b negotiate a rescheduling of the cpec loans and c let the foreign exchange value of the rupee undergo a free fall the first option would make pakistan an international pariah so it can be ruled out as a non starter whereas the second is unlikely to happen the third option is dangerous for a variety of reasons perhaps more so than anything because it could unleash a period of hyperinflation in the country and going by the experience of venezuela or zimbabwe that is not a desirable situation unfortunately there is no choice other than fiscal austerity euphemistically termed fiscal consolidation by economists for the next two to three years one can only hope that the poor in this country are spared the worst privations in the upcoming budget the writer is a group director at the jang group email iqbal hussain janggroup com pk
john howard famously declared during his 2004 re election campaign that interest rates would always be lower under a coalition government that s been a truism for several years now with the official cash rate at a record low of 1 5 per cent but if the betting is correct about our interest rate trajectory it may well be that interest rates under the morrison government will forever hold the record for the lowest of all time that would be a neat historical bookend given the highest was 21 4 per cent which occurred in april 1982 during the fraser government when mr howard was treasurer no one equates low interest rates with superior economic management any longer in fact it s debatable just how much influence governments have over rates given its habit of shifting in 0 25 percentage point increments when the reserve bank lowers rates tomorrow afternoon it will be firing off one of the last six shots remaining in the chamber market economists are falling over themselves guessing how many are to come the consensus is two cuts one tomorrow the next in august but the outliers are predicting as many as four in the next 12 months that points to an exceptionally weak economy susceptible to a growing list of potential international shocks a message starkly at odds with that presented at the budget and the election just two months ago we were promised a decade of federal budget surpluses based upon a strong and recovering economy when a housing slump collides with rising unemployment that s the problem with booms they tend to unwind occasionally in spectacular fashion especially when they ve been supercharged with debt super cycle payback low wages and record debt supplied that s where we find ourselves hocked to the eyeballs with no obvious way out wages growth has slumped and savings have depleted more concerning the housing boom where most of that debt has been deployed is but a distant memory it has been in reverse for four years in west australia and for more than 18 months on the east coast that s leaving a growing number of owners under water owing more than their house is worth if it s temporary and you can keep paying the mortgage that s not a problem but an extended price decline hits a growing number of homeowners and if the economy sours and firms start laying off indebted workers the banks and the financial system take a hit in the west and the northern territory almost 15 per cent of all mortgages are in negative equity so when the unemployment rate ticked higher last month the reserve bank was left with no alternative rates had to be cut and lending restrictions loosened with the alp s defeat two threats to property values easing property tax concessions around negative gearing and capital gains were removed add in the first home buyer government guarantee and that s a five point housing market stimulus plan that immediately changed housing market sentiment but the spruikers predicting another property boom may have some time to wait it s more likely the market bottom will be reached sooner and not be quite so severe but prices still have some way to fall why the economy is slowing no one is mentioning the r word quite yet but the run of bleak news on our economy has been unrelenting of late on almost every key measure in fact it s extraordinary no one made much of a fuss about it during the election inflation came in at zero for the march quarter wages growth is anaemic retail sales are poor car sales have plummeted and last friday credit growth was weaker than even the pessimists were forecasting that followed sluggish business investment data along with a sharper than expected fall in building approvals and despite all the recent hype housing prices continue to slide on wednesday we ll be presented with the march quarter gdp numbers this time last year they were strong but in the second half of last year the economy suddenly weakened there s every indication that trend continued in the first quarter of this year with annual growth expected to come in at just 1 6 per cent life in the slow lane supplied there s just one part of the economy that is doing well and that s exports more specifically our iron ore exports have been forging ahead not only have we been shipping vast quantities to china we ve been raking in vast profits iron ore prices have soared as china has pumped in stimulus at the same time supplies from brazil have been disrupted by catastrophic dam failures with tragic consequences that export performance may lift real gdp and nominal gdp which includes value unfortunately given our mining industry is dominated by foreign owners most of that cash ultimately flows out of the country australia s iron ore exports have been one of the few high points of the economy reuters david gray what if the rate cuts don t work when the reserve bank cuts rates it has more than just home owners in mind the main aim is to force the australian dollar lower that helps boost our export income and makes our local industries more competitive unfortunately according to investment bank ubs our temporary iron ore export boom could prevent a dramatic fall in the currency which means the rba would be firing off one round of its precious ammunition for little or no impact that s why reserve bank governor philip lowe has called on federal and state governments to help stimulate the economy these include further monetary easing additional fiscal support including through spending on infrastructure he told a group of economists in brisbane a fortnight ago relying on just one type of policy has limitations that s a big admission from a central banker that it no longer has enough conventional firepower and it is in need of old style government spending it s a realisation that s dawned a little too late on many of the world s biggest monetary authorities the problem is state governments particularly in nsw and victoria have coasted along on the back of a property boom that now has turned to bust the stamp duty rivers of gold no longer are flowing meaning the federal government will most likely have to step up and that will punch a massive hole in the budget even so should everything turn pear shaped the rba is prepared to delve into the murky world of unconventional monetary warfare late last year just as the first signs of our slowdown became apparent rba deputy governor guy debelle let slip the bank could engage in quantitative easing a form of money printing employed by the us japan and europe in the aftermath of the global financial crisis our weakening economy couldn t have come at a worse time an increasingly aggressive america is upping the ante with a hugely indebted and slowing china over trade our major trading partner global bond traders are pricing in a global recession what a time to win an election
the move shocked investors and spurred a broad sell off that sliced more than 350 points from the dow jones industrial average the selling left the benchmark s p 500 index 6 6 lower for the month and up 9 8 for the year so far clearly the markets were blindsided and completely caught off guard said cliff hodge director of investments for cornerstone wealth it was only a month ago that the s p 500 hit a record high and underlined its claim as the longest bull market for stocks on record at more than a decade long the market had climbed steadily through 2019 amid rising investor confidence that a deal with china was at hand and that the federal reserve would not tip the economy into recession by raising interest rates too aggressively but when the first weekend of may arrived trump s tweet threatening more tariffs on china upended months of calm in the market investors are now preparing for a much longer and messier resolution to the global trade war than they were expecting just a few weeks ago the trade conflicts have also clouded the global economic outlook with many economists now forecasting u s growth to weaken in the coming months that s likely to weigh on corporate profits this year what you had over the last few days really is an increase in global uncertainty and the economic data has been poor and weakening said tom martin senior portfolio manager with globalt investments with rising costs as a result of tariffs and rising uncertainty that s definitely going to have a damper on earnings the s p 500 index fell 36 80 points or 1 3 to 2 752 06 it s the first time the s p 500 has dropped for four straight weeks since autumn 2014 the dow lost 354 84 points or 1 4 to 24 815 04 the nasdaq slid 114 57 points or 1 5 to 7 453 15 the russell 2000 index of smaller companies gave up 20 04 points or 1 4 to 1 465 49 major stock indexes in europe also fell you had a market that was feeling as though president trump would want to do a deal so that the economy would not be hurt said martin and now the behaviour is indicating that he will use tariffs to accomplish his goals and seems less concerned about the actual economic impact since the end of april investors have sought out safer investments like utilities and bonds technology stocks which led gains all year were among the month s biggest losers the technology heavy nasdaq shed 7 9 while technology companies within the s p 500 lost 8 9 utilities which have lagged the market fell only 1 3 in may making them among the month s best performers meanwhile real estate stocks posted a 0 9 gain the only winners this month the new tariffs on mexican goods shocked investors who were already nervous about a global trade war crimping economic growth the new front in the trade war hit automakers particularly hard many of them import vehicles from mexico general motors slid 4 3 friday while fiat chrysler dropped 4 8 ford motor lost 2 3 banks also declined as higher bond prices pushed yields lower the yield on the 10 year treasury note slid to 2 13 from 2 22 late thursday investors have been shifting money into bonds over concerns that economic growth will be crimped by the ongoing trade war lower bond yields drag down interest rates making lending less profitable for banks citigroup fell 2 3 and bank of america lost 2 1 energy companies sank following another broad slide in oil prices occidental petroleum fell 4 1 and valero energy dropped 3 4 investors have been fleeing to safer holdings all month the shift to utilities and bonds quickened earlier in may after the u s and china broke off negotiations the u s then pushed more tariffs on chinese goods along with a ban on technology sales that prompted retaliatory tariffs from china and threats over other key resources while the u s economy grew at a solid 3 1 annual rate in the january march quarter many economists now think growth is likely to weaken in coming months they cite a range of threats facing the u s economy including escalating trade conflicts more cautious spending by consumers and businesses and a global economic slowdown on friday a report showed china s factory activity slowed in may as the trade war between washington and beijing escalated economists say china may be drawing up its own list of retaliatory targets among u s companies the worry is that a trade war fought on multiple fronts around the world will be a drag on corporate profits and on a u s economy that s been supported by a solid job market that worry pulled the yield on the 10 year treasury note to its lowest level since the summer of 2017 that s left long term treasury yields below some short term yields an unusual occurrence that many investors see as a warning sign of recession investors are also raising their bets that the federal reserve will need to cut interest rates later in 2019 to help the economy less than a year after it had been raising rates to get them closer to normal the fact that the president is willing to use tariffs as a weapon can really cause damage to business confidence hodge said you ve got to be wondering who s next energy futures closed broadly lower friday

swift s latin american regional conference larc explored how banks in the region are looking to increase digitisation while managing cyber and compliance challenges ignacio blanco head of latin america the caribbean at swift opened larc by noting that customer demands from financial services have rapidly increased in the digital world with organisations operating in a world that is hyper connected financial institutions need to evolve from market leaders to digital leaders he said this was supported by an audience poll that asked delegates to think about the main driver for digital transformation in their organisation with business model adaptation 32 and meeting customer expectations 31 being selected as the key drivers accelerating digital transformation as to how banks are approaching this challenge kartikeya swami associate partner at mckinsey company described how they are deploying systems and tools to drive products with an agile test and learn approach developing solutions and getting them out to customers for testing as quickly as possible taking on feedback updating the solution and sending it out for more feedback thinking about what it takes to successfully support the acceleration of digital transformation christopher mager ctp managing director digital office at bny mellon treasury services said that two years ago his institution had moved to pursue a more centralised strategy by creating an enterprise level digital group their clients often hold relationships with a number of the bank s businesses across the world he said so this enterprise view was helpful to provide a seamless approach as part of this process bny mellon created a digital council that has representatives from all the different business groups and key stakeholders while each business within the group should prioritise its own developments there are certain functions that every business undertakes such as onboarding clients or providing reporting for example this is where the digital council and enterprise approach has its focus mager said helping the business structure its data across the enterprise and avoiding duplicating costs kasif wadiwala associate partner at deloitte consulting reinforced the point that financial institutions need a bank wide digital strategy in order to bring all businesses along on the digitisation journey at the same time he added that banks need to understand what their business process rules are and how they manage technological investments before jumping into digitisation projects commenting on his own bank george doolittle executive vice president and head of global payments services corporate investment banking at wells fargo said they realised they had centralised innovation too much and needed to get the various business lines more involved in the process the business lines have the customer connection which is key in developing solutions that actually solve customer needs when it comes to payments for example customers want a fast effective and secure experience this point was raised by beatriz quevedo uman a regional head of client management global liquidity and cash management latin america for hsbc who noted that this need is the same for consumers and businesses alike mo nica garci a luzio vice president of finance at banco bisa added that corporates need more information around their payments which is why her bank had added support for swift gpi last year a question from the audience on day 1 of larc asked about how banks can go about balancing digital innovation with cyber security and regulatory requirements bny mellon s mager responded by saying that his team works closely with business partners on the digital council so that legal and compliance teams at the bank have an input on the bank s innovations it is important to get all key stakeholders on board before investing in and working on innovation in order to address any particular issues before time and resources are spent on a project facing cyber challenges the threat that banks face from cyber criminals was highlighted by swami who commented that 25 7 of all malware attacks in 2018 hit banks and other financial services organisations cyber actors will attempt to infiltrate a local system via a phishing attack a compromised security token or similar pat antonacci head of customer experience at swift explained they would then look to move large volumes of funds over weekends or holidays for example while banks smartened up to this approach and would monitor for these sorts of attacks fraudsters will now try to withdraw smaller but more numerous amounts during weekdays julian dana director of latin america for mandiant at fireeye made the point that advanced persistent threats apts are one group of cyber actors to pay particular attention to today these groups can often be government sponsored apts from countries such as north korea have evolved he noted from acting like hacktivists to now looking for financial gain as a way around economic sanctions ransomware like wannacry is an example of this apts have local contacts to support attacks who can help with reverse engineering to generate an insider threat adam bulava executive director of attack simulation with jp morgan added that the us financial sector has developed cyber response guides across the community to help address cyber threats the more that banks run through these eventualities the better they will be able to respond to a real attack the human element in combating cyber crime was highlighted by carmen zegarra digital crimes unit attorney for microsoft she said that people may have their password underneath their keyboard use basic passwords or use the same password on their company computer that they use on their mobile phone she stressed that organisation wide education is critical to build awareness nine out of ten people will click on a phishing link so the business needs to understand that fighting cyber crime is everyone s responsibility bulava said that jp morgan regularly carries out phishing tests across all of their employees in a move designed to further awareness and to protect the business he added that the bank has a red team of ethical hackers who will attack the bank s environment to try and gain access to data or accounts this can highlight where previously unknown vulnerabilities exist in the bank s infrastructure delegates had a chance to see skylar simmons from swift s own red team carry out a live hack on the second day of larc 2019 simmons showed how a methodical approach could allow a hacker to find a bank s ip address relatively easily see which ports of the bank s ip addresses are open and target the information they could uncover to quickly gain access to the bank s servers using a variety of tools that are easily available online in the hack simmons was able to download sensitive files from the bank s server he also found that the bank had written its own programme to send mt103 messages without using swift interfaces while the system was set up to only allow authorised users to send payment messages having compromised the system the hacker can start checking what security measures exist and bypass these quickly sending tens of millions of dollars to his own accounts the speed at which simmons was able to demonstrate a hacker s attempt to gain access to a bank s core systems provided plenty of food for thought for attending delegates keeping up with compliance as well as balancing an innovative digital agenda with managing the cyber threats banks also need to be able to keep up with the compliance demands they face speaking to this point on the second day of larc sandra depoalo managing director and global head of aml with bny mellon said that the compliance team needs to engage with the business team in a bank to understand new clients before the onboarding process begins she said that aml compliance in the bank could call a similar person in the potential client organisation at the start of this process for example depoalo added that it is important to find out if correspondent banks have similar controls in place if a bank is making repeated requests for information that go unanswered from its correspondent red flags can be quickly raised maristella aldana sanin chief compliance officer at bancolombia agreed with the need for compliance to be close to the business compliance programmes need to be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they share the ethical principles of the organisation as well as the regulatory rules in compliance she added that they are also trying to improve the customer experience by being as agile and efficient as possible by using new technologies such as bots to scan for suspicious operations and comparing customers with a pool of peers for example corporate governance is critical to ensuring that compliance is understood across the whole organisation carlos e troetsch partner and executive vice president at mmg bank president of felaban said that this allows institutions to be proactive rather than reactive and it should be integrated into a bank s risk programme speaking to different banks in other regions also helps support the understanding of compliance in a bank beneficial ownership was named as the biggest compliance challenge globally by james h freis jr chief compliance officer and managing director at deutsche bo rse group the question is who is behind the corporate entity he said what is the nature of the corporate business and where are the funds coming from while it can be difficult to address beneficial ownership freis said that if it is done right it could create a level playing field across all countries collaboration and innovation to create common standards such as the swift kyc registry help in this regard he added regional considerations the issue of corruption and compliance is clearly top of mind for financial institutions in latin america a poll of delegates showed 69 believe that the biggest concern for latin america today is corruption and its impact on foreign direct investment fdi claudio irigoyen managing director head of latin america economics and foreign exchange fixed income strategy at bank of america merrill lynch commented that this issue has certainly been very important in different national elections in latin america in the past couple of years he did add however that the elephant in the room with regard to fdi is the possibility of us china trade wars on that topic humberto lo pez director of strategy and operations for latin america with the world bank observed a split in latin america noting how the northern part of the region looks to the us while the southern part of region looks to china he added that interest rates in the us could be a concern for companies in latin america with high levels of debt looking at where opportunities exist in the continent irigoyen mentioned brazil saying that expectations have adjusted significantly since the most recent presidential election with the reform bill in brazil expected to be passed by q3 2019 and additionally a market friendly government being elected in argentina there are good economic news stories in the region he said margaret myers director of the asia latin america program inter american dialogue highlighted softbank s us 5bn technology growth fund for start ups which could help to promote growth in the region she added that the advancement of 5g across the region offered the prospect of development in industries such as agriculture and mining in closing larc 2019 swift s ignacio blanco drew attention to the variety of opportunities for banks to accelerate digital transformation in latin america that had been discussed at the conference he concluded by saying that this transformation needs collaboration and it is critical that institutions foster a culture that supports this

trading partner this time the target is mexico trump plans to impose 5 tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 and to ratchet them up to 25 by oct 1 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border tariffs have become one of trump s favorite policy tools the president who calls himself a tariff man has slapped the levies on imported steel aluminum dishwashers and solar panels he s also imposed them on 250 billion worth of chinese goods in a dispute over china s aggressive campaign to challenge american technological dominance and he s planning to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese imports that he hasn t already targeted before trump tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries when nations tended to focus on keeping imports out and exporting as much as they could more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ q are we in a trade war economists have no set definition of a trade war but with the world s two largest economies now slapping potentially punishing tariffs on each other it looks as if a trade war has arrived all told trump has threatened to hit as much as 550 billion worth of china s exports to the u s with punitive tariffs that s more than the 506 billion in goods that china shipped to the united states last year it s not uncommon for countries even close allies to fight over trade in specific products the united states and canada for example have squabbled for decades over softwood lumber but the u s and china are fighting over much broader issues like china s requirements that american companies share advanced technology to access china s market and the overall u s trade deficit with china so far neither side has shown any sign of bending ___ q so what are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they re typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller in the united states tariffs also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ q do other countries have higher tariffs than the united states most key u s trading partners do not have significantly higher average tariffs according to an analysis by greg daco at oxford economics u s tariffs on imported goods adjusted for trade volumes average 2 4 percent above japan s 2 percent and just below the 3 percent for the european union and 3 1 percent for canada the comparable figures for mexico and china are higher both have higher duties that top 4 percent trump has complained about the 270 percent duty that canada imposes on dairy products but the united states has its own ultra high tariffs 168 percent on peanuts and 350 percent on tobacco ___ q what are tariffs supposed to accomplish two things raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for the u s government from 1790 to 1860 for example they produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy by douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the u s government collected 34 6 billion in customs duties and fees the white house office of management and budget expects tariffs to fetch 40 4 billion this year tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after world war ii the formation of the world trade organization and the advent of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement among the u s mexico and canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether ___ q why are tariffs making a comeback after years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade a populist backlash has grown against globalization this was evident in trump s 2016 election and the british vote that year to leave the european union both surprise setbacks for the free trade establishment critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to china and other low wage countries then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all since china joined the wto in 2001 the united states has shed 3 1 million factory jobs though many economists attribute much of that loss not just to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on china mexico and other countries he blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for america s persistent trade deficits 566 billion last year most economists by contrast say the deficit simply reflects the reality that the united states spends more than it saves by imposing tariffs he is beginning to turn his hard line campaign rhetoric into action ___ q are tariffs a wise policy most economists trump s trade adviser peter navarro is a notable exception say no the tariffs drive up the cost of imports and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise their prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components some u s companies that buy steel are complaining that trump s tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices more broadly economists say trade restrictions make the economy less efficient facing less competition from abroad domestic companies lose

reading time 6 minutes south african reserve bank governor lesetja kganyago has called on african countries to be smarter when borrowing money he says debt is not a replacement for domestic revenue mobilisation kganyago was delivering his opening address at the african economic research consortium s 50th biannual plenary currently underway in cape town the plenary brought together more than 200 researchers academics policy makers and economists to discuss the rising debt levels faced by african countries there should be transparency in debt reporting prioritize rebuilding a buffer through change of reforms said gov lesetja kganyago governor south african reserve bank africadebt 50thbiannualplenary pic twitter com edyoptx1wc aercafrica aercafrica june 2 2019 in officially welcoming the delegates at the workshop kganyago also raised concern that debt should not be used for other intended purposes public debt has as important role to play in financing development particularly in smoothing government expenditure however it should be clear that debt is not a replacement for domestic revenue mobilisation meanwhile debt levels have to remain sustainable so as not to undermine market confidence to ensure that debt plays a meaningful role it must be utilised for revenue generating activities that increase the productive capacity of the economy he further warned that debt is not something that can be hidden saying debt transparency is crucial i have heard of people being able to hide assets in some foreign countries i have never thought that people would even conceivably think of hiding debt because how long can you hide it at some stage somebody will come to you and say you owe me and so the debt will come out so i do not understand why people even try to hide the debt so the issue of debt transparency is going to be come crucial going forward rising levels of debt on the continent the executive secretary of the un economic commission for africa vera songwe is one of the delegates who presented her research paper on rising levels of debt on the continent the external debt annual growth rate for cameroon djibouti ethiopia rwanda uganda and zambia is above 25 said dr vera songwe under secretary general eca_official africadebt 50thbiannualplenary pic twitter com di3ad0dubr aercafrica aercafrica june 2 2019 songwe told the consortium that increasing interest rates instead of the debt itself is the main problem that leads to the high levels of debt faced by african countries the fact again that our debt is high is high again is not the problem it s the fact that we cannot pay the interest rate that s where the problem is and as the interest rates begin to change we begin to fall into problem i had a paper where i show ghana for example goes to the market and raised a euro bond for 750 million dollars and then interest rates change and that euro bond becomes 1 point three billion us dollars the citizen s of ghana are paying the exchange rate

is actually a capacity based network and what we do is that we encourage evidence based policy advice to african countries what we are going to do with these papers the take always is that we are going to summarise these papers and in future they will inform policy and one of them is convening the policy makers especially minister of finance to actually discuss the issues and even the implementation we convene policy makers once we have some resource to share over 4 200 economists have graduated through aerc graduate training programs 400 of those at phd level professor njuguna

tax revenue collection in african countries it turned out that the zimbabwean treasury s introduction of a 2 tax on all electronic transactions has yielded positive results beyond that government s expectations this is according to zimbabwe s deputy reserve bank governor kupukile mlambo during the media briefing mlambo says zimbabwe s national budget is solely dependent on domestic resources and domestic borrowing he says the tax on electronic transaction even managed to cater for the recent floods that hit the country treasury they introduced a 2 percent tax on all electronic transactions this is very important for zimbabwe because 95 percent of our domestic transactions are in electronic form so cash really accounts for a very small amount of payments because of the shortage of cash now what this 2 percent tax on electronic transactions has done is that it has also managed to bring in the informal sector which normally doesn t pay taxes and for the first time in almost six years we are to have a surplus on our budget so that is one of the ways we have done and we were able to pay for unforeseen disasters like cyclone idai out of that 2 so it has really worked more than we

trump s tariffs what are they how do they work washington ap president donald trump has once again turned to tariffs to try to get his way with a u s trading partner this time the target is mexico trump plans to impose 5 tariffs on mexican imports starting june 10 and to ratchet them up to 25 by oct 1 if the mexicans don t do more to stop the surge of central american migrants across the southern u s border tariffs have become one of trump s favorite policy tools the president who calls himself a tariff man has slapped the levies on imported steel aluminum dishwashers and solar panels he s also imposed them on 250 billion worth of chinese goods in a dispute over china s aggressive campaign to challenge american technological dominance and he s planning to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese imports that he hasn t already targeted before trump tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries when nations tended to focus on keeping imports out and exporting as much as they could more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ q are we in a trade war economists have no set definition of a trade war but with the world s two largest economies now slapping potentially punishing tariffs on each other it looks as if a trade war has arrived all told trump has threatened to hit as much as 550 billion worth of china s exports to the u s with punitive tariffs that s more than the 506 billion in goods that china shipped to the united states last year it s not uncommon for countries even close allies to fight over trade in specific products the united states and canada for example have squabbled for decades over softwood lumber but the u s and china are fighting over much broader issues like china s requirements that american companies share advanced technology to access china s market and the overall u s trade deficit with china so far neither side has shown any sign of bending ___ q so what are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they re typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller in the united states tariffs also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional duties on foreign imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ q do other countries have higher tariffs than the united states most key u s trading partners do not have significantly higher average tariffs according to an analysis by greg daco at oxford economics u s tariffs on imported goods adjusted for trade volumes average 2 4 percent above japan s 2 percent and just below the 3 percent for the european union and 3 1 percent for canada the comparable figures for mexico and china are higher both have higher duties that top 4 percent trump has complained about the 270 percent duty that canada imposes on dairy products but the united states has its own ultra high tariffs 168 percent on peanuts and 350 percent on tobacco ___ q what are tariffs supposed to accomplish two things raise government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the establishment of the federal income tax in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for the u s government from 1790 to 1860 for example they produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy by douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the u s government collected 34 6 billion in customs duties and fees the white house office of management and budget expects tariffs to fetch 40 4 billion this year tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after world war ii the formation of the world trade organization and the advent of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement among the u s mexico and canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether ___ q why are tariffs making a comeback after years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade a populist backlash has grown against globalization this was evident in trump s 2016 election and the british vote that year to leave the european union both surprise setbacks for the free trade establishment critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to china and other low wage countries then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all since china joined the wto in 2001 the united states has shed 3 1 million factory jobs though many economists attribute much of that loss not just to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on china mexico and other countries he blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for america s persistent trade deficits 566 billion last year most economists by contrast say the deficit simply reflects the reality that the united states spends more than it saves by imposing tariffs he is beginning to turn his hard line campaign rhetoric into action ___ q are tariffs a wise policy most economists trump s trade adviser peter navarro is a notable exception say no the tariffs drive up the cost of imports and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise their prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components some u s companies that buy steel are complaining that trump s tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices more broadly economists say trade restrictions make the economy less efficient facing less competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase

american consumers would pay a hefty price if president donald trump carries out his latest tariff threat against mexico but that s just one of many issues created by the president s pledge to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on one of the country s largest trading partners trump said via tweet on thursday he would impose tariffs of 5 percent on all mexican imports beginning june 10 in response to the flow of migrants over the southern u s border a subsequent white house statement said the tariffs would rise incrementally up to 25 percent by oct 1 unless mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory the uncertainty caused financial markets to plummet and threatened to send stocks lower for the sixth week in a row this is just the latest worry to put on the fire for investors said ryan detrick senior market strategist for lpl financial can we really fight two trade wars at the same time the prospect of fighting trade wars on multiple fronts spooks investors and executives alike as we are all fighting to develop plans to exit or to reduce our exposure to china one of our options mexico is now equally in jeopardy said rick helfenbein president and ceo of the american apparel footwear association this could roil u s and global financial markets which could see this as a signal that trump is leading us in the direction of a global trade war if that were to happen the u s economy could get hit hard said desmond lachman resident fellow at the american enterprise institute a right leaning think tank from a consumer perspective everything from cars to vegetables would get more expensive the u s imports 53 billion worth of autos from mexico and the country also is a major supplier of produce electronics and apparel including more than one third of men s and boy s jeans according to helfenbein prices will go up sales will go down jobs will be lost he said this has a devastating effect on our industry a lot of companies in the u s not just retailers treat north america as a unified market said david french senior vice president of government relations at the national retail federation it opens a new front in uncertainty for retailers but really for the u s economy president trump s attempt to bully mexico has horrified u s businesses as well as mexican political leaders said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics we expect the market to keep falling until the president blinks lachlan estimated that a 25 percent tariff on all mexican imports could add 0 4 percent to inflation but even more than just the health of the economy is at stake it borders more on the crazy bill daley former u s secretary of commerce under president bill clinton said on cnbc s squawk box on friday characterizing trump s mexico tariff threat as throwing gas on a fire the really shocking thing about this from a political standpoint is this is an abrupt reversal of everything the administration has been signaling about its top legislative priority said phil levy senior fellow on the global economy at the chicago council on global affairs levy pointed out that on thursday u s trade representative robert lighthizer asked congress to begin the ratification process for the united states mexico canada agreement usmca trump s replacement to the north american free trade agreement the office of the u s trade representative has called the trade pact a mutually beneficial win for north american workers farmers ranchers and businesses that would create a more level playing field for american exports now its passage is in jeopardy although acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney told reporters on thursday the two are absolutely not linked and said these are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute experts disagree saying trump absolutely risks derailing the pact slapping tariffs on mexico would almost certainly be deemed illegal under world trade organization rules trade experts on both the right and the left say this is alarming because it sends a message to all u s trading partners that the president has no compunctions about breaking treaties even ones he orchestrated it s a clear signal the president does not feel bound by trade agreements levy said as the threat of a full on trade war with china grows beijing is more likely to dig in if its trade negotiators believe trump would extract concessions in order to make a deal only to turn around and break his word in the eyes of the outside world this means that the u s is now the world s biggest rogue trader shepherdson said this has far reaching implications that could leave the u s with a tarnished reputation on the global stage well after trump s presidency is over a legacy that could take a long time to overcome this action would further undermine the rule based international trade system that the u s so painfully put together in the post war period lachman said does this seem like the extent of the trade problems we re going to have levy said this says no we re going to pick trade wars anywhere there s something that annoys the president

big money raiser for the u s government from 1790 to 1860 for example they produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to clashing over commerce a history of us trade policy by douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast last year tariffs accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 the u s government collected 34 6 billion in customs duties and fees the white house office of management and budget expects tariffs to fetch 40 4 billion this year tariffs also are meant to increase the price of imports or to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their products at unfairly low prices tariffs discourage imports by making them more expensive they also reduce competitive pressure on domestic competitors and can allow them to raise prices tariffs fell out of favor as global trade expanded after world war ii the formation of the world trade organization and the advent of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement among the u s mexico and canada reduced tariffs or eliminated them altogether ___ q why are tariffs making a comeback after years of trade agreements that bound the countries of the world more closely and erased restrictions on trade a populist backlash has grown against globalization this was evident in trump s 2016 election and the british vote that year to leave the european union both surprise setbacks for the free trade establishment critics note that big corporations in rich countries exploited looser rules to move factories to china and other low wage countries then shipped goods back to their wealthy home countries while paying low tariffs or none at all since china joined the wto in 2001 the united states has shed 3 1 million factory jobs though many economists attribute much of that loss not just to trade but to robots and other technologies that replace human workers trump campaigned on a pledge to rewrite trade agreements and crack down on china mexico and other countries he blames what he calls their abusive trade policies for america s persistent trade deficits 566 billion last year most economists by contrast say the deficit simply reflects the reality that the united states spends more than it saves by imposing tariffs he is beginning to turn his hard line campaign rhetoric into action ___ q are tariffs a wise policy most economists trump s trade adviser peter navarro is a notable exception say no the tariffs drive up the cost of imports and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise their prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported components some u s companies that buy steel are complaining that trump s tariffs put them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer their products at lower prices more broadly economists say trade restrictions make the economy less efficient facing less competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best ___ animated explainer on trade disputes ___ follow paul wiseman on twitter at
exico city tomato exporter sergio esquer peiro spent much of friday in hastily called meetings with other stunned growers trying to evaluate the potential fallout of u s president donald trump s threat to slap coercive tariffs on all imports from mexico the sudden announcement caught observers on both sides of the border by surprise and prompted president andrés manuel lópez obrador to dispatch his top diplomat to washington for talks seeking to head off the proposed tariffs obrador said mexico won t panic over the threatened hike but economists and those whose livelihoods depend on the trade relationship worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year worry that stiff duties could have dramatic negative consequences and potentially spark a trade war between the neighboring countries already esquer and other exporters were having to contend with a 17 56 tariff on tomatoes imposed after washington announced in march it was ending a longstanding agreement over alleged mexican dumping of the fruit if the new duties do take effect esquer is looking at another 5 being slapped on his products potentially increasing to 25 in subsequent months unless mexico does more to stop illegal migration through its territory by a june 10 deadline per trump s demand right now more than anything there is a reaction of disbelief with everything that is going on esquer who s been sending tomatoes and other crops to the united states for 60 years told the associated press by phone during a break in the meetings it also goes against the spirit there is between both countries the agreements we have the bilateral trade we have which is very successful esquer continued on the other hand we ll have to wait for the reaction of u s exporters to mexico because they are also going to see their exports threatened if mexico launches some kind of mirror policy from berries and automobiles to machinery and household appliances all of mexico s exports stand to be hit with the tariffs avocado growers in michoacan electronics factory workers in tamaulipas across the border from texas auto parts exporters all would feel the pinch esquer who does business from the tomato growing northwestern state of sinaloa said it s not just businessmen who stand to lose since mexico s estimated 700 tomato exporters are responsible for directly generating some 450 000 jobs according to mexico s agriculture department last year some 2 billion in tomatoes were exported to the united states second only to tequila and ahead of avocados the threat also throws into question the future of the usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada hammered out in months of contentious negotiations as a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s most touted achievements trump s threat came the same day mexico announced it would begin the process of ratifying the usmca and less than two weeks after it successfully negotiated the lifting of u s steel and aluminum tariffs that had been a roadblock to final approval for the trade deal it would really have a terrible impact on our producers and our exporters said kenneth smith ramos who led then president enrique peña nieto s delegation to usmca talks and is now an international trade consultant at mexico city based agon and it would hurt u s producers as well because they rely a lot on mexican inputs for their production he added so it would reduce their competitiveness and force them to raise prices which would ultimately of course hit consumers that means people like chuck sholtis ceo of el paso texas based plastic molding technology inc which employs 100 people most of its business involves plastic injection molding for automotive electronics and business products for maquiladoras factories in mexico that are run by foreign companies sholtis said his company has already suffered from u s steel tariffs on china that increased the costs of their tools and it s also been hit by slowdowns at ports of entry sholtis said the united states has found a niche in high tech specialized manufacturing that s part of a global supply chain he fears that if more tariffs like this are implemented or if the usmca doesn t take effect the united states will lose its edge in manufacturing he s also worried about possible recession in mexico and the united states it s illogical sholtis said tariffs go against one of the stated goals of the administration to help manufacturing and thereby create high skilled manufacturing jobs the economic impact for mexico was swift with the peso down more than 3 against the u s dollar friday u s stocks likewise tumbled on wall street initial macroeconomic projections from economists were also chilling analyst alfredo coutiño of moody s analytics said mexican exports to the u s totaled 358 billion last year or 80 of all goods the country sold overseas over the course of a year he said a 5 tariff would represent about 18 billion in damage or 1 5 of mexico s gdp while a 25 tariff would amount to 90 billion or 7 3 of gdp banco base estimated that a 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off growth of mexico s exports but said a weaker peso would help compensate such tariffs would likely push mexico into a recession as well as disrupt regional supply chains and hurt investor confidence oxford economics economist gregory daco wrote in a report coutiño said mexico could impose retaliatory penalties sparking a tariff war a second less aggressive but potentially more effective option would be to allow the peso to depreciate to the point where the tariffs would be neutralized he added via twitter trump argued that mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico already has implemented policies and actions to discourage irregular migration last month it raided the latest caravan of mostly central american migrants traveling through the southern state of chiapas arresting hundreds and effectively breaking it up there have been no significant caravans since then with many migrants saying they now fear to travel in large groups mexico also has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more with seemingly endless waits for permits that would allow them to travel legally through the country but sealing its porous southern border with guatemala is probably impossible because mexico lacks sufficient infrastructure to completely patrol a frontier that includes a river passing through dense jungle we are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy lópez obrador said friday morning while making no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly central american immigrants transiting mexico to reach the u s border we have to help so that they don t enter the united states illegally but we also have to do it respecting human rights said lópez obrador nothing authoritarian they re human beings lópez obrador espouses a longer term holistic approach focused on improving security development and economic opportunity in the migrants countries of origin especially honduras guatemala and el salvador for now lópez obrador is betting on diplomacy and dialogue foreign relations secretary marcelo ebrard announced talks would take place next wednesday in washington with him and u s secretary of state mike pompeo leading their respective nations delegations there is a disposition for dialogue ebrard tweeted we will be firm and we will defend the dignity of mexico in ciudad juarez across from el paso texas 21 year old jennifer del carmen pérez hernández said she moved there three years ago because she couldn t find work in her home state of veracruz on the gulf coast pérez said when she first arrived she was told that if trump were elected staff cuts

the european union eu is a political and economic union borne after world war ii of a desire for harmony in a scarred and divided european continent the original concept was founded on the hope that it would make war unthinkable and materially impossible the original deal was signed in 1950 and called for six nations belgium france italy luxembourg the netherlands and west germany to pool their coal and steel resources seven years later those nations signed the treaty of rome creating the european economic community this laid the foundations of today s european union the bloc has grown steadily from its six founding members to 28 nations today but so have its political complications this week s european parliament ep election results reflect more differences than common causes the eu s political landscape is undergoing a shift europe s longtime political center comprising traditional center left and center right blocs has lost its majority in the ep parties on both edges of the political spectrum have expanded their influence the results suggest that the ep will be a fickle place in the years to come today s political commotion is nothing compared to the upheaval of the late 1980s and early 1990s the era of the end of communism in europe and the reunification of germany however the decisions taken by the new ep will have important implications for europe s economic future representatives to the ep are directly elected by citizens every five years the body has grown in size in the last two decades as many ex communist states in central and eastern europe have joined the eu the ep currently has 751 members called meps germany has the most 96 delegates followed by france with 74 and the u k and italy with 73 each the treaty of lisbon signed in 2007 was instrumental in expanding the ep s powers today the ep has three main roles legislative supervisory and budgetary one of the parliament s main legislative roles is scrutinizing and passing laws proposed by the european commission ec the bureaucratic division of the eu meps have co decision powers in nearly all policy areas they shape eu laws jointly with the council of the eu finding consensus on eu fiscal policy just got even more difficult the ep is responsible for electing the president of the ec and approving the european budget it has strong influence over the banking sector establishing unified banking supervision the single supervisory mechanism and as well as strengthening the european banking authority through regulations such as the bank recovery and resolution directive leaders of the european central bank ecb are subject to ep approval with a louder voice populists and nationalists in the ep will want to put their stamp on economic policy in particular they will seek to control immigration and ease european fiscal rules both issues have been at the core of the growing resentment against the eu as an institution deep political divisions between european countries and parties may also complicate the appointment of the next ec and ecb presidents the prospect of a fiscal policy expansion will create immediate stress for the ep since many eu members share a common currency the ep has set limits on deficits and debt relaxing these rules will raise concerns particularly for countries with high debt levels and poor fiscal discipline italy s fiscal position is already gaining attention amid its weak fundamentals and possible ec disciplinary action over its rising debt against the backdrop of the region s weakening economic prospects uncertainty around future eu policies could lead to significant market volatility and credit rating downgrades for some european nations the ep also has a say in treaties ranging from trade talks to brexit patience for brexit has run dry in many eu nations as reflected in april discussions that resulted in a deferral of the u k s departure however on a faintly positive note the brexit mess has prompted introspection among eurosceptic parties now seeking to change the eu from the inside rather than leave the union from the u k s perspective the success of nigel farage s brexit party in the ep election will push tory leaders toward supporting a no deal brexit boris johnson the leading tory candidate for prime minister recently stated that we will leave the eu on 31 october deal or no deal the odds of a hard or no deal brexit are clearly on the rise again odds of a no deal brexit have risen the race for senior leadership positions in europe is also heating up french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel are in disagreement over who should lead the eu the election of the next ec president will be particularly important and could tilt the odds toward or away from a country s other candidates for instance the election of an ec president from germany would effectively eliminate german jens weidmann s candidacy to be ecb president european policymaking is set to become more challenging with consequences for future trade policy immigration and further eu reforms the traditional political blocs will be pressured into uncomfortable compromises or alliances in order to pass important legislation we do not think the eu is facing an existential threat in the wake of last weekend s elections the populists did not gain as much as some had expected and the middle still seems to be holding but pressure from the wings will make consensus hard to reach at a time when the european economy needs firm direction surprising patience a historical study of tariffs reveals a host of discouraging outcomes lower economic output slower productivity higher unemployment and little change to trade balances with these risks well identified why would any u s business welcome tariffs and yet objections to the tariffs from the american business community have thus far been muted we see a few reasons for this quiet posture but it may not last for starters protectionism creates both winners and losers those who benefit from protection from international trade will make their satisfaction known u s metal producers gained from the steel and aluminum tariffs granting them protection to raise prices and improve their margins domestic manufacturers of products that lost substantial market share to china from handbags to shoes may similarly gain meanwhile the businesses that are worse off from the new tariffs are dispersed across industries and geographies making it difficult for them to speak out in unison some business managers have tried to manage their supply chains to mitigate the risk of tariffs in the second quarter of 2018 economic growth was boosted by a surge in spending to get ahead of the tariffs that loomed large on the horizon in the first quarter of this year inventory accumulation was a source of outsized growth likely due to a push to stay ahead of expected increases in tariffs this has deferred public expressions of discontent fewer voices exist to raise objections as well production of goods in the u s has been in decline for decades companies remaining in manufacturing have been shaped by this downturn and may be cheering the tough stance on china as a matter of principle while defenses of the tariffs vary some realists have made the case that any costs incurred fighting china are worth the long term advantage reclaimed from diminishing china s power in world trade tariffs are a new cost to be absorbed but the strong u s dollar is currently giving importers a purchasing power advantage in addition throughout 2018 american businesses were adjusting to the windfall of the newly enacted tax cuts and jobs act any minor cost increases from tariffs were a wash in the bottom line as corporate tax rates fell for those who could be most severely affected there has been recourse manufacturers who are reliant on chinese sources for which no other supplier is available may seek relief by appealing to the commerce department hundreds of such exemptions have been granted the targets of retaliation specifically farmers will again receive direct subsidies from the government to replace lost sales and purchase unsold crops this year such subsidies cannot carry on forever but they have helped placate an influential bloc of voters any drag from tariffs has been balanced by positive forces the phased nature of the tariffs implementation has also blunted some of the more dramatic consequences that would raise the voices of detractors two weeks ago the u s nearly implemented tariffs of up to 25 on imported vehicles and auto parts while the ensuing uproar from foreign brands dealers and enthusiasts would have been potent it has thus far been unnecessary we believe the deferral was a good idea for many reasons not least because most foreign automakers have long invested in domestic production of vehicles within the u s thus far continued growth despite escalating trade tensions has demonstrated the resilience of the u s economy any new burdens have been tolerable and often negated by other economic drivers however this list of reasons for the muted reaction to tariffs is a set of transient circumstances eventually the business community will scream will our leaders listen who pays we ve been having a debate within the office on what impact the escalating breadth and depth of tariffs between china and the united states will have on inflation the answer as it always is in economics is complicated what is clear is that the prices of goods affected by tariffs have gone up at least for now exporters can offer some discounts to offset tariffs but they come at the cost of profitability reducing margins that were already thin the larger the tariff and the longer it remains in place the more likely that the underlying good will become more expensive the first chart below shows this clearly the federal reserve has estimated that the latest round of tariffs will cost the average american family more than 800 annually this will vary significantly from household to household based on what each consumes higher prices however invite consumers to evaluate their options they may switch to domestic alternatives or cut back on their purchases of the specific product these second order effects tend to push down the price level inflation from tariffs may be undone if the economy slows finally tariffs act as a tax on both households and firms economic theory suggests that higher taxes typically result in lower levels of economic activity slower growth in turn usually means lower inflation the timing and size of these elements depends on a number of things consumers can stockpile goods prior to the implementation of a tariff deferring the pinch to their pocketbooks producers can work around tariffs by re engineering their supply chains government stimulus can be used to keep economic growth on track a key in all of this is the flexibility of consumption and production if there are no clear substitutes for a given product and if it is difficult to re work supply chains tariffs have the potential to add more prominently to inflation taking all of this into account forecasters have estimated that the current set of tariffs against china is likely to add about 0 2 to core inflation over the next twelve months but if the tariffs are extended to cover all chinese imports inflation will shrink because of the damage done to economic activity the latest threatened tariffs against mexico if implemented may follow a similar pattern of near term inflation followed by a retreat with events moving quickly the calculus surrounding this issue will need to be refreshed frequently

tariff on all mexican imports from june 10 which will gradually increase until illegal immigration across the southern border stopped from mexico if the trade war continues then the fear of a

had said the central bank would act if inflation stays too low or global and financial risks endanger the economic outlook what the clarida s comments have done is clarify in many people s minds the answer to the questions of whether low inflation proving more than transitory would itself be enough to get the fed to ease the answer appears to be yes said ray attrill head of fx strategy at national australia bank that served to reinforce prevailing market expectations that the fed will be easing in the second half of this year indeed the case that the inflation slowdown was temporary took a blow when the core personal consumption expenditures index the fed s favoured measure of inflation was revised down to 1 for the first quarter from 1 3 trump s tariff threat only added to the

these are the bad times i opened a may 23 post with those five words and they seem even more apt now than they did a week ago the linked post documented the fallout in chinese markets from allegedly imminent us action against a bevy of surveillance companies including hikvision and dahua initial and subsequent reporting suggested the us would cite concerns about the role of china s surveillance industry in alleged human rights abuses in the northwest region of xinjiang in other words it seems likely that at some point in the near future the us will point to the plight of the uighurs as a justification for a crackdown on more key companies in china the mechanism used to punish those companies would be similar to the huawei blacklisting in addition to blanket coverage of this on my site i wrote a simple primer on the situation for this platform here the problem with this for market participants is obvious there is seemingly no longer a distinction between us economic trade policy and the rest of the administration s agenda the huawei ban was couched in national security terms but the goal is clearly to extract trade concessions from china the proposed action against chinese surveillance companies will apparently be justified at least in part by human rights concerns but again it is obvious that one goal of the prospective move is to secure the upper hand in the trade war if the rout in semis soxx following the huawei ban see visual wasn t enough to convince you of the dangers inherent in blurring the line between economic policy and national security you re probably closer to being a believer after friday s action heisenberg on thursday evening the market learned that when the lines are blurred as described above it creates a two way street that is when national security measures can be wielded to extract trade concessions trade measures can be likewise utilized to advance unrelated agenda items as you re undoubtedly aware the trump administration over the objections of top trade negotiator bob lighthizer and against the advice of treasury secretary steve mnuchin decided to slap across the board tariffs on mexico starting at 5 from june 10 and ratcheting higher at regular intervals up to 25 in october the goal of these measures is to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into the us say what you will about the relative merits of that approach but the fact is lighthizer a trade hawk opposed it on the grounds that the tariffs would imperil the ratification of the usmca that s a deal bob knows something about considering he helped negotiate it and is in the process of working with nancy pelosi to push it through congress if you don t believe bob which again you should because if you don t trust lighthizer s opinion on the usmca then it s not clear whose opinion you would prefer instead you could simply ask every single analyst on wall street every commentator who weighed in on friday and of course mexico itself there are direct quotes from a bevy of analysts experts and mexican officials here the market was not pleased with the latest tariff news for a variety of reasons not the least of which is that as detailed above the read through for the future of us trade policy isn t market friendly the tariffs on mexico prove the administration will hit america s trade partners with levies to advance agenda items that are at best only tangentially related to the us economy perhaps just as importantly the new duties also prove that striking a trade deal with the administration is no panacea a deal does not necessarily shield a country from the unilateral imposition of additional tariffs we do not doubt the credibility of the tariff threat but the use of tariffs to push for a solution to the immigration issue is a strong but slightly unorthodox option in some ways socgen wrote in a note dated friday adding that on the us side it sets a precedent for geopolitical or social negotiations with a possible adverse impact on the credibility of its international and economic relations and negotiations including trade deals with other countries the s p spy logged its fourth daily loss of 1 or more in may as a direct result of the latest tariff escalation this week marked the index s fourth consecutive weekly decline heisenberg 10 year us yields tlt plunged by a remarkable 18bp on the week and 2 year yields fell an astounding 22bp for the biggest weekly decline since the crisis years underscoring just how serious the mexico tariffs are in terms of clouding the outlook both jpmorgan and barclays were out friday calling for fed cuts in september if not sooner both banks cited the duties on america s southern neighbor in their notes the expansion of tariffs to mexico after already negotiating a revised usmca to replace nafta represents an important development since trade restrictions are now becoming multilateral in nature barclays wrote on the way to predicting a 50bp fed cut in september when it was all said and done last month was the second worst may for us stocks since the 1960s considering everything that went on it could have been far worse unfortunately the mexico tariffs suggest things will in fact deteriorate further barring some kind of quick resolution or else an indication that tensions between washington and beijing will soon abate on that latter point there are no such indications china is set to lay out its stance on the situation in an event scheduled for sunday but concurrent with the announcement of that press conference was news that beijing is opening an investigation into fedex fdx the company whose shares have suffered mightily over the course of the trade conflict see the visual below is the first to be targeted by china for a newly announced unreliable entities list a mechanism clearly aimed at blacklisting foreign companies complicit in the us effort to undermine huawei heisenberg beijing unveiled plans for the entities list on friday morning barely 24 hours later fedex was on it or at least it seems that way the move against fedex is related to huawei s allegations detailed by reuters on monday that packages were diverted without the company s permission simply put this is spiraling out of control there s no other way to describe it it s always possible to put a relatively positive spin on things by simply gaming out the mechanical impact of the various protectionist measures at the 30 000 foot level for instance here s a table from goldman which shows the projected hit to s p 500 bottom lines under the various tariff rates on mexico goldman barclays ran their own quick sensitivity analysis which appears to suggest that the overall impact in a worst case scenario would be very muted our analysis indicates that an across the board 25 tariff on all us imports from mexico could hurt 2019e earnings by 1 6 if mexico responds with a similar tariff on us exports there could be an additional negative impact of 1 0 the bank wrote friday barclays but the bank went on to note that while the impact on aggregate earnings is relatively limited there is substantial variation across sectors with consumer discretionary and industrials the most impacted and the auto industry the most exposed the visual shows the variation that underscores a key takeaway these tariff discussions always sound relatively benign when you have them at the 30 000 foot level but that only captures the mechanical index level impact and in the case of the table above from goldman the price increase i e the amount consumer prices need to rise that will allow companies to avoid a hit to the bottom line those analytical exercises don t take into account the myriad second order effects from falling stock prices wider credit spreads a concern at a time when the us corporate sector is over leveraged late in the cycle the hit to sentiment and the fact that at the individual company level the situation could be quite dramatic for instance in the worst case scenario deutsche bank estimates that the ebit hit from these tariffs will be 3 3bn for ford f and 6 3bn for gm gm that s assuming they take the full unmitigated impact from a 25 tariff rate on mexican imports of course they won t rather they ll pass that cost on to car buyers and on deutsche s estimates the average cost of vehicles sold in the us would jump by 1 300 here s a list from goldman that shows russell 1000 companies who break out their assets in mexico goldman in the same note that visual is from goldman echoes bofa bnp socgen and likely a half dozen other banks in warning that this could seriously imperil the passage of the usmca to the extent tariffs on imports from mexico reduce the likelihood of usmca passage companies reliant on supply chains in canada may also suffer goldman warns noting that the bank s economists believe the implementation of tariffs on mexico would cause both house democratic leadership and mexico to slow their consideration of usmca lowering the odds of enactment this year in a separate note out friday barclays warns on the read through for trade more generally to wit we expect a broader risk off in markets as the bar for additional tariffs on other trading partners has been arguably lowered with the use of tariffs to advance immigration policy despite a recently negotiated trade deal usmca the us move may represent risks to countries that are currently engaged in trade talks with the us but at odds on other policy issues this of course encompasses the existing discussions with china on its technological infringements and industrial policies but also europe on agricultural policy and defense spending the fx market effect of these developments will be to boost safe havens such as the usd and the jpy and it is a significant negative for economies that are likely to be directly affected by tariffs e g china mexico euro area but also trade centric and commodity exporting economies in g10 and em of course a stronger dollar and a stronger yen are negative for risk assets the former tightens financial conditions and exacerbates the drag on global trade which depends on usd liquidity while the latter serves to undermine confidence given jpy s role as the global risk off bellwether i e the yen s signaling effect is strong heisenberg it s possible that this situation will improve simply because it has to that is it s not clear how this setup will be tenable even for another couple of days who knows maybe china will strike a conciliatory tone during the above mentioned press conference on sunday meanwhile mexican officials have been careful to come across as constructive in their public comments since the announcement of the tariffs but it s hard to imagine what china might say to soften the blow considering the shrill rhetoric out of state media and now the investigation into fedex at the same time mexico will probably at least pretend to take steps to do more to curtail illegal immigration in an effort to convince the trump administration to delay the planned tariffs the problem though is that between the escalations with china and the unexpected announcement targeting mexican imports investor sentiment may have suffered a fatal blow on the bright side it looks like jerome powell will have no choice but to cut rates by the end of the year
currency and equity traders felt the sting of protectionism on friday as china and the us take fresh steps to restrict trade overnight the trump administration announced plans to impose 5 tariff on all mexican imports starting june 10th and the rate will gradually increase if the crisis of undocumented migrants persists rates would rise to 10 on july 1st if meaningful changes aren t made and increase an additional 5 each month for 3 months trump is resorting to a tariff wall instead of a border wall but politics aside this broad tariff will hurt not only the mexican economy but american consumers and businesses two things can be assured in a trade war slower growth and higher prices for all parties involved the sharp sell off in stocks on friday reflects the market s concern that even though mexico and china will lose the most from trump s trade tantrums american businesses will be hit hard as well it is estimated that for a company like gm each 5 increase in tariffs could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars second half earnings are already at risk because tariffs on china but adding tariffs on mexico could lead to an earnings recession the dollar weakened against all of the major currencies on friday because when president trump announces fresh tariffs the first response by investors is panic over us earnings unfortunately the rest of the world suffers alongside the us so don t be lured by the relief rallies in eur aud and other currencies german retail sales fell 2 in april which was significantly worse than the market s forecast for an increase this tells us that the deterioration in the labor market is more than a statistical fluke earlier this week german unemployment rolls rose the most in 4 years and while part of that was due to changes in categorization the labor department warned that this was the first sign of a weakening economy the european central bank meets next week and it will be an important one not only will the details of the tltro program be released but economic projections will also be updated ecb president draghi will then decide if the economy has weakened enough for them to signal the need for more stimulus the eurozone is in a low growth phase and despite some improvements since the last monetary policy meeting the most important drivers of monetary policy consumer spending inflation manufacturing activity and retail sales weakened for now the eu escaped auto tariffs but a simultaneous slowdown in the us and china will hit the economy hard if the ecb felt that more stimulus was warranted before the us slapped china with another round of tariffs they will certainly feel that accommodative policy will be needed for the foreseeable future eur usd crashed after their last meeting when they rolled out tltro and could fall further if the central bank lowers their growth and inflation forecasts but that may not be enough given how deeply oversold the eur usd is investors may have already discounted ecb dovishness and accounted for lower economic projections so the nail in the coffin for the euro may have to be changes in their forward guidance or talk of new loan programs beyond the current tltro the ecb meeting is not until thursday and between now and then eur usd is a sell on rallies and not a buy on dips for the past week aud usd traded in a very tight range and a breakout is on the horizon between a reserve bank of australia monetary policy announcement retail sales gdp pmis and the trade balance it will be nearly impossible for aud usd to remain confined within this past week s 45 pip trading range the market is pricing in a 93 chance of a rate cut by the rba and the only question is whether they ll follow with another move in july or august the decision to lower interest rates will be an easy one because us china trade talks were the only reason why they passed on it in may but now that the us has proceeded with tariffs on china australia needs to preempt a recession by providing stimulus now vice president pence talked about a possible meeting between trump and xi but with china announcing plans to release an unreliable entities list and the us talking about yet another round of tariffs the outlook for sino us trade relations is grim so while domestic data hasn t been terrible and the labor market in particular is strong australia s economy could be hit hard in the coming months if the rba cuts interest rates and talks about doing more we could see aud usd fall to fresh lows if they ease and sound noncommittal about future movements there s hope for a sustainable relief rally

from credit fuelled boom to currency crisis as turkey s economy unravels we ask what can be done to stop the rot istanbul plays an oversized role in the turkish economy and politics it has been the gateway to the presidency for recep tayyip erdogan and represents a third of the country s economy after a quarter of a century erdogan lost the battle to control the financial capital but controversially another vote to elect the mayor has been planned it is just one of a number of issues that has many people and businesses losing faith in the country after a credit fuelled boom led to bust many are switching to the dollar foreign exchange deposits and funds rose to a record high of 182bn this month the lira has fallen about 37 percent since the beginning of 2018 pushing the economy into recession the central bank has stopped short of implementing capital controls on the way governments limit the flow of money in and out of the country during the boom years delivered mostly through property and construction corporations borrowed in dollars and are now finding it difficult to repay 200bn in loans meanwhile unemployment has jumped to a decade high of 14 7 percent and inflation soared to 19 5 percent the turkish government has promised a series of financial reforms to revive the economy but for now many consumers are struggling to pay for imported goods where did it all go wrong for the economy our institutions are now paralysed we need to rebuild our system by introducing a rule based system in line with universal law separation of powers checks and balances otherwise i believe the current system will self terminate by durmus yilmaz turkey s former central bank governor in 2008 our gdp per capita was above 8 000 and it raised up to 12 000 but today we are below the 2008 numbers says durmus yilmaz former central bank governor the reason behind it is the chosen growth model you can t be a big economy with the skyscrapers you build in istanbul ankara or izmir but they can be your prestige projects turkey shall never capitulate them all infrastructure canal railway fast train projects must continue even with foreign subsidiary because these are the essentials of an economy however a substantial part of foreign money we received has been allocated to a construction sector that feeds 750 different sub sectors this created a boom in the economy but at the end your cash flow is in local currency but your debt is in foreign exchange so we are stuck now in order to fix the turkish economy he says our job is to follow token economy policies and build up the country s interest accordingly as the opposition we and others say the finance and treasury minister the president s son in law should resign but this will not resolve the problem this is a systemic issue this system has paralysed the decision making process in the economy if you monopolise the authority that person manages all we have to address the key trigger of the problem which is this new presidential system which is unique to turkey our institutions are now paralysed we need to rebuild our system by introducing a rule based system in line with universal law separation of powers checks and balances otherwise i believe the current system will self terminate yilmaz says mozambique s debt crisis mozambique is hoping to secure billions of dollars for reconstruction after the devastation of cyclones idai and kenneth cyclone idai alone left more than 600 people dead and about 1 8 million people in need according to the united nations mozambique needs 3 2bn for post cyclone reconstruction the international monetary fund imf says growth could slow to at least 1 8 percent from 3 5 percent from losses to agriculture transport and communications food shortages in beira one of the hardest hit cities and surrounding areas could push prices up 8 5 percent from 5 5 percent mozambique s port of beira is an important hub for the country as well as for neighbouring malawi and zimbabwe but it is not operating right now and according to the finance ministry most homes hospitals and schools had suffered large scale destruction a debt crisis has complicated mozambique s finances in 2016 it admitted to 1 4bn in undisclosed funding that prompted the imf to cut off support triggering a currency collapse and debt default it has little hope of repaying the debt in 2017 the debt to gdp ratio was 112 percent by 2022 the imf forecasts that it could climb to over 130 percent but the country is resource rich it hopes to become the next liquified natural gas powerhouse by 2025 mozambique is on track to invest 128bn but it would still be many many years before it gets over its debt crisis and begins to reap the benefit of the gas anish kapadia managing director of akap energy says some of the debt was clearly fraudulently issued and then you ve got the more conventional eurobonds that were issued as well in terms of that fraudulently issued debt there s a good chance that mozambique may be able to get that written off in terms of the eurobond issue i think it makes sense for the mozambique government to come to some kind of an agreement with the debt holders to move forward because the main thing is that mozambique needs to be in a position where it can raise further debt going forward from really benefit from the full potential of the

pleasant surprises household spending jumped 0 9 per cent the strongest since 2017 and a little better than the quarterly average according to data that date to 1961 consumption accounts for about 60 per cent of gdp so our ability to grow as an economy is dictated to a significant degree by our willingness or ability to buy stuff the bank of canada has assumed for a long time that spending would slow under the weight of a decade long debt binge late last year household purchases slowed too much forcing the central bank to pause its plan to tug interest rates back to a more normal level so a sign of life is welcome suggesting that this year s impressive run of hiring data including some evidence that the hot labour market might finally be putting upward pressure on wages is offsetting the burden of households record debt load consumer spending bounced back strongly after a poor performance in the second half of 2018 matthew stewart director of economics at the conference board of canada said in an email he called the increase substantial and added that households may not be having as much difficulty with their substantial debt burden and rising interest rates as many feared

spent 78 4 billion on new machinery and equipment in the first quarter a nine per cent surge from the previous quarter and the most since early 2008 the quarter to quarter increase was the biggest since 1996 suggesting that canadian companies which have been piling up profits for years finally got off the sidelines poloz said that would happen the bank of canada s surveys of business intentions kept showing that executives were gearing up to invest the resolution of the new north american trade agreement eased worries about the terms on which commerce would be based on the continent and federal tax cuts on investment also likely created a tailwind the early year slowdown will be temporary veronica clark economist citibank investment is key because it signals future activity companies

clients this reinforces our view that the early year slowdown will be temporary to be sure an external shock remains a present danger traders re upped their bets that the bank of canada will be forced to cut interest rates putting more weight on donald trump s decision to escalate the trade wars than all the positive indicators contained within the latest gdp report by linking punitive duties on mexico to the flight of refugees from central america trump risks erasing whatever positive sentiment he instilled by ending aluminum and steel duties on shipments from canada and mexico and the conflict with china feels like it could get worse before it gets better the volatility of trade policy is why there was no indication from the bank of canada this week that it intends to resume raising interest rates wilkins reminded reporters in calgary that the benchmark rate still is lower than inflation meaning real interest rates are negative that s not normal and explains why

originally published at china financial markets a number of recent articles suggest that chinese officials may reduce their purchases of u s government bonds it is very unlikely that china can do so in any meaningful way because doing so would almost certainly be costly for beijing and even if china took this step it would have either no impact or a positive impact on the u s economy note this is an updated version of a previously published january 2018 blog post the original version can be accessed here suggestions by some chinese officials that they may reduce their purchases of u s treasury bonds show just how poorly the world understands the balance of payments here is what a recent financial times article had to say it was an unnerving piece of data for investors last week buried halfway down an esoteric spreadsheet released by the us government that tracks how many treasuries foreign investors buy and sell china the largest foreign creditor to the us government with total treasury holdings in excess of 1 2tn sold 20bn of securities with a maturity exceeding one year in march according to us government data the sales amounted to china s largest retreat from the market in more than two years the article then goes on to suggest that china s reduced holdings of u s treasury bonds may reflect a strategic response to the escalating trade conflict between beijing and washington the data reignited fears that beijing may weaponise its holdings as part of the trade war wreaking havoc with the biggest bond market in the world pushing interest rates higher and increasing the us government s cost of borrowing if china starts dumping its treasuries it would cause huge financial instability said mark sobel a former treasury department official who spent nearly four decades at the agency adding that he considered this an unlikely scenario in january 2018 i explained on this blog why china cannot weaponize its holdings of u s government bonds it is not because as many observers seem to think that selling off the bonds would cause havoc in the market and in doing so would undermine the value of china s own holdings this is very unlikely first of all the federal reserve could easily act to overcome any temporary volatility second as another article in the same issue of the financial times points out rising uncertainty is causing investors to increase their purchases of u s government bonds us treasury yields plunged to their lowest level since 2017 and shares fell more than 1 per cent on thursday as the deepening trade dispute between the us and china raised concerns about global economic growth the rush to the relative safety of government debt pushed the yield on 10 year us treasury bonds to roughly the same level as when the federal reserve began raising interest rates in 2015 longer term rates fell below shorter term ones a yield curve inversion that is seen by many traders as an indication of an impending economic downturn i thought it would make sense to revisit and update my january 2018 post as i explained in that entry the real reason china cannot sell off its holdings of u s government bonds is because chinese purchases were not made to accommodate u s needs rather china made these purchases to accommodate a domestic demand deficiency in china chinese capital exports are simply the flip side of the country s current account surplus and without the former they could not hold down the currency enough to permit the latter to see why any chinese threat to retaliate against u s trade intervention would actually undermine china s own position in the trade negotiations consider all the ways in which beijing can reduce its purchases of u s government bonds beijing could buy fewer u s government bonds and more other u s assets so that net capital flows from china to the united states would remain unchanged beijing could buy fewer u s government and other u s assets but other chinese entities could then in turn buy more u s assets so that net capital flows from china to the united states would stay unchanged beijing and other chinese entities could buy fewer u s assets and replace them with an equivalently larger amount of assets from other developed countries so that net capital flows from china to the united states would be reduced and net capital flows from china to other developed countries would increase by the same amount beijing and other chinese entities could buy fewer u s assets and replace them with an equivalently larger amount of assets from other developing countries so that net capital flows from china to the united states would be reduced and net capital flows from china to other developing countries would increase by the same amount beijing and other chinese entities could buy fewer u s assets and not replace them by purchasing an equivalently larger amount of assets from other countries so that net capital flows from china to the united states and to the world would be reduced these five paths cover every possible way beijing can reduce official purchases of u s government bonds china can buy other u s assets other developed country assets other developing country assets or domestic assets no other option is possible the first two ways would change nothing for either china or the united states the second two ways would change nothing for china but would cause the u s trade deficit to decline either in ways that would reduce u s unemployment or in ways that would reduce u s debt finally the fifth way would also cause the u s trade deficit to decline in ways that would likely either reduce u s unemployment or reduce u s debt but this would come at the expense of causing the chinese trade surplus to decline in ways that would either increase chinese unemployment or increase chinese debt by purchasing fewer u s government bonds in other words beijing would leave the united states either unchanged or better off while doing so would also leave china either unchanged or worse off this doesn t strike me as a policy beijing is likely to pursue hotly and washington would certainly not be opposed to it let s consider each possibility in turn 1 beijing could buy fewer u s government bonds and more other u s assets so that net capital flows from china to the united states would remain unchanged this would be a non event beijing would in effect simply redirect its purchases from u s government bonds to other u s assets of course the seller of those other assets would then be forced to deploy the proceeds of the sales elsewhere so that directly or eventually the proceeds would be used to buy the u s government bonds that beijing sold the only thing that would change in this case is that beijing would have swapped riskless u s assets for risky u s assets in that case there would be no net impact on overall u s interest rates and a very small impact on relative interest rates because this outcome represents nothing more than a swap by beijing out of lower risk assets into higher risk assets with no net change in demand for u s assets the result might be at most a small rise in yields on riskless assets matched by an equivalent tightening of credit spreads there would be no change in overall u s investment except to the extent that tightening credit spreads would cause a small rise in risky u s investments what is more beijing s decision would leave the u s capital account surplus unchanged so it could not have an impact on the u s current account or trade deficits finally beijing s decision would leave the chinese capital account deficit unchanged so it could not have an impact on the chinese current account or trade surpluses 2 beijing could buy fewer u s government and other u s assets but other chinese entities could then in turn buy more u s assets so that net capital flows from china to the united states would stay unchanged again this would largely be a non event the volume of chinese capital flows to the united states would be unaffected but there would be minor changes in the composition of assets to which the flows are directed as in the previous case there would be no net impact on overall u s interest rates and a very small impact on relative interest rates again the result might be at most a small rise in yields on riskless assets matched by an equivalent tightening of credit spreads again as in the previous case there would be no change in overall u s investment except to the extent that tightening credit spreads cause a small rise in risky u s investments beijing s decision would also leave the u s capital account surplus unchanged so it could not have any impact on the u s current account or trade deficits finally beijing s decision would leave the chinese capital account deficit unchanged so it could not have any impact on the chinese current account or trade surpluses 3 beijing and other chinese entities could buy fewer u s assets and replace them with an equivalently larger amount of assets from other developed countries so that net capital flows from china to the united states would be reduced and net capital flows from china to other developed countries would increase by the same amount we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in this case china s overall capital account deficit and current account surplus would remain unchanged but there would be a reduction in its bilateral capital account deficit and current account surplus with the united states and an increase in its capital account deficits and current account surpluses with the rest of the developed world the reduction in the u s current account deficit would mean a reduction in the excess of u s investment over u s savings if u s investment were constrained by an inability to access savings this reduction would occur in the form of lower u s investment because this is not the case given that u s businesses have easy access to as much capital as they need to fund investment the adjustment would occur in the form of higher u s savings savings can be forced up in many different ways almost always involving either less debt or lower unemployment for example a reduction in capital inflows can deflate asset bubbles and so discourage consumption through wealth effects such a reduction can lower consumption by raising interest rates on consumer credit or this reduction could even take place by encouraging stronger consumer lending standards a reduction in capital inflows can also increase savings by reducing unemployment one way or another in economies like the united states that do not suffer from weak access to capital a reduction in foreign capital inflows will automatically increase domestic savings it may be harder than we think for china to redirect capital flows from the united states to other developed economies continental europe japan and the uk are the only developed economies large enough to absorb a significant change in the volume of capital inflows but none of them are eager to absorb the current account implications some economists misunderstanding the nature of the account identity that ties net capital inflows to the gap between investment and savings will undoubtedly argue that these inflows would cause investment in europe japan and the uk to rise but this is wrong it would only be true if investment in these economies had previously been constrained by scarce savings but because this is clearly not the case in today s environment the impact of higher capital inflows into developed economies could only be to reduce domestic savings for developed economies in other words significantly higher capital inflows from abroad would either cause savings to decline as the inflows strengthen their currencies and reduce exports causing either unemployment or consumption to rise or if their central banks act to sterilize the inflows to increase imports by increasing consumer debt if continental europe japan and the uk are unwilling to accept higher unemployment or higher debt they would be unwilling to allow unlimited chinese access to domestic investment and may quickly take steps either to retaliate or to redirect the flows to the united states in the latter case of course it would again be a non event to the extent that developed countries do not redirect chinese capital inflows to the united states however chinese sales of u s government bonds would affect the u s economy but largely in positive ways first of all and contrary to popular perception a reduction of chinese capital flows to the united states would not cause u s interest rates to rise except to the extent that it would cause u s economic growth to pick up because the reduction of the u s capital account surplus would result in an increase in u s savings this would fully match the reduction in chinese savings that had previously been imported by the united states this is just the logical consequence of the balance of payments constraints there would be no direct change in overall u s investment and there would be an increase in u s savings driven by either lower unemployment or a reduction in consumer debt there might be an indirect change in u s investment eventually as the american trade deficit declines remember that because beijing s decision would reduce the overall u s capital account surplus it would also automatically reduce the u s current account and trade deficits for reasons that i discuss in an earlier blog entry finally because beijing s decision would leave the chinese capital account deficit unchanged it would have no impact on the chinese current account or trade surpluses 4 beijing and other chinese entities could buy fewer u s assets and replace them with an equivalently larger amount of assets from other developing countries so that net capital flows from china to the united states would be reduced and net capital flows from china to other developing countries would increase by the same amount in this case as in the previous china s overall capital account deficit and current account surplus would remain unchanged but there would be a reduction in its bilateral capital account deficit and current account surplus with the united states and an increase in its capital account deficits and current account surpluses with the developing world as explained above the reduction in the u s current account deficit would occur through an increase in u s savings there is no difference between this case and the previous one as far as its impact on the united states or on china interest rates in either country would remain unchanged the u s trade deficit would decline and china s trade surplus would remain unchanged there is one important difference to the global economy however because investment in developing countries is often constrained by difficulty accessing global savings a redirection of chinese capital from the united states to developing countries would boost investment in those countries this would increase global growth and would benefit both developed economies and developing economies including the united states but the reason this is unlikely to happen to any large extent is that china has had a very bad experience with its investments in developing countries and may not be eager to raise them significantly more than it has already planned 5 beijing and other chinese entities could buy fewer u s assets and not replace them by purchasing an equivalently larger amount of assets from other countries so that net capital flows from china to the united states and to the world would be reduced finally china could reduce its overall capital account deficit by reducing the amount of capital directed to the united states and not replacing it with capital directed elsewhere china in other words would export less capital abroad this would mean by definition that china must either reduce domestic savings or increase domestic investment this would also mean of course that beijing must run lower current account and trade surpluses one way savings can decline quickly is if a drop in exports causes unemployment to rise the only other way is if there is a surge in consumer debt for investment to rise quickly there almost certainly has to be either a rise in unsold inventory as exports drop or a rise in nonproductive investment in infrastructure in either case this would mean a rising debt burden as in the previous two cases there would be no direct change in overall u s investment and there would be an increase in u s savings the latter driven either by lower unemployment or a reduction in consumer debt there might be an indirect change in u s investment eventually as the american trade deficit declines this is because as beijing s decision reduces the overall u s capital account surplus it also would automatically reduce the u s current account and trade deficits most importantly for china beijing s decision would reduce the chinese capital account deficit and so it would necessarily also result in a reduction in the chinese current account or trade surpluses conclusion even if beijing forced institutions like the people s bank of china to purchase fewer u s government bonds such a step cannot credibly be seen as meaningful retaliation against rising trade protectionism in the united states as i have showed beijing s decision would have no impact at all on the u s balance of payments or it would have a positive impact it would have almost no impact on u s interest rates except to the extent perhaps of a slight narrowing of credit spreads to balance a slight increase in riskless rates it would also have no impact on the chinese balance of payments in the case that it leaves the u s balance of payments unaffected to the extent that it would result in a narrower u s trade deficit there are only three possible ways this might affect the chinese balance first china could export more capital to developed countries in which case the decision would have no immediate impact on china s overall balance of payments but it would run the risk of angering its trade partners and inviting retaliation second china could export more capital to developing countries in which case the decision would have no immediate impact on china s

by barani krishnan investing com sell in may and go away is a proven stock market adage but more than the it was oil that saw investors flee last month the u s crude benchmark lost a stunning 16 the global gauge for oil fell 11 and even after the worst losses in six months the horror story may not be over yet for oil the coming week particularly will determine whether wti gets to stay above the critically important 50 per barrel mark and brent the 60 threshold as of friday there was greater likelihood of the two breaking below those support levels than defending them and there was good reason for that just last week alone all the positives in oil from opec engineered production cuts to sanctions on venezuelan and iranian exports that allowed wti to build a rally as high as 40 year to date seem to vanish suddenly in their place were fears of a global recession made very possible by a dramatic escalation in the u s china trade war and unexpected tariffs on mexico by president donald trump who s intent on punishing that country for apparently not doing enough to prevent illegal migration by its people into america like oil gold too is likely to have an eventful week in the precious metal s case it will be whether it gets to build on the 1 300 psychological highs established last week stay in a range around those levels or fall back to 1 200 levels for now the path of

that progressively to 25 until the flow of undocumented immigrants across the border stops while the president insists that the united states will benefit from its tough action against both china and mexico economists say u s consumers will lose both ways as importers will find ways to pass the import duties along to buyers hence the fear of economic fallout that s hammering oil now wti broke below the 55 per barrel level the first time since february setting a low of 54 73 brent crashed under 65 to a 16 week bottom of 63 05 on a more crucial technical level both benchmarks broke below all

draw of 0 86 million barrels in two previous weeks it announced back to back builds of around 5 0 million barrels oil bulls typically count on strong refinery runs and heavy gasoline consumption in the run up the summer but refiners have been slow to draw down crude in the run up to this summer as profit margins for producing gasoline were running about 30 below year ago levels some suspect that one reason for trump s escalation of trade battles around the world was to after opec s refusal to raise production lately most interestingly he hasn t sent out a single tweet about oil for weeks now

proving that he really is a tariff man as he has threatened fresh tariffs on mexico as he seeks to push forth immigration reform efforts along the southern border of the us regardless of the efficacy of using tariffs as a tool to negotiate on immigration the fact is that the trump administration has shown a willingness to go to places that other us presidential administrations have not so it s too soon to say if these barks will result in bites withtrade war concernsaround the globe swirling with the us at the center there has been a steady shift towards safe haven assets like developed

this summer the nation is expected to celebrate an impressive milestone the longest economic expansion in the nation s history beginning in the wake of the great recession it will surpass the 120 month record recorded from 1991 to 2001 it fills me with dread why because this expansion has been squandered leaving individuals and the nation collectively terribly vulnerable when the next recession arrives an expansion this long should have been an opportunity to grow the middle class for families to build up financial cushions and for the nation to begin cutting into the debt none of that has happened another year of economic expansion and low national unemployment rates did little to narrow the persistent economic disparities by race education and geography notes the federal reserve in its latest report on household fiscal well being the same report found an american working class highly dependent on maxed out credit with four in 10 people saying they wouldn t be able to scrape together 400 to meet an emergency expense in many ways they mirror their government over the coming decade the united states ranks first among advanced economies in the projected growth of its national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product projections show debt rising from 78 percent of gdp now to 92 percent by 2029 if various set to expire tax cuts and spending hikes are continued which is usually the case the debt will be 105 percent of gdp come 2029 many other advanced countries project debt reductions germany as high as 10 percent what happens when a recession hits people lose jobs and need a financial cushion to meet minimal expenses despite the record expansion and an employment rate of 3 6 percent that is the lowest in 50 years many americans don t have it in recessions deficits get worse as government must provide unemployment benefits demand for social programs expands and federal spending is necessary to try to restart economic growth yet in good times the country is facing explosive growth in deficit spending the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget warns that if the debt continues to climb at some point investors will lose confidence in the government s ability to pay back borrowed funds they would demand higher interest rates on the debt and at some point rates could rise sharply and suddenly both major parties share the blame for this situation with tax revenues covering only two thirds of federal expenses the rest going on the national credit card however the republican initiative when in control of the house senate and presidency to approve massive tax cuts in 2017 was particularly reckless there was no need to spur the economy it was already growing there was no attempt to offset the tax cuts with spending reductions no wonder then the deficit is rapidly expanding a new congressional research service report concludes the tax cuts had little impact on overall economic growth and instead exacerbated the growing gap between the very rich and the rest of us they provided a corporate windfall from 2017 to 2018 the estimated average corporate tax rate fell from 23 5 to 12 1 and individual income taxes as a percentage of personal income fell slightly from 9 6 to 9 2 states crs the tax cuts contributed to a record breaking surge in corporate stock buybacks crs found but little in worker wage growth as for the tax cuts paying for themselves the crs found they produced an increase of 0 3 percent in gross domestic product in 2018 at most to pay for themselves an increase of more than 6 7 percent would have been necessary our best hope the expansion continues forever paul choiniere is the editorial page editor

sanctions are having a deep impact on iran but are they changing its behavior iran seen as unwavering despite sanctions us exit from nuclear deal one year after president donald trump withdrew the u s from the iran nuclear deal and began reimposing sanctions iran is experiencing dramatic economic distress inflation has soared oil exports have dropped and the government is facing revenue shortfalls but instead of bringing about a change in the government s behavior the pressure campaign has led to tehran doubling down on its opposition to talks with the trump administration and some u s officials say they see an increased threat from iran and its proxies in the region something iran denies last may trump pulled out of the nuclear accord formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa which saw the u s and other powers france germany the united kingdom china and russia lift certain economic sanctions in exchange for iran accepting limits on and inspections of its nuclear program acting u s defense secretary patrick shanahan left speaks to members of the media as secretary of state mike pompeo listens may 21 2019 on capitol hill in washington alex wong getty images the accord was a signature foreign policy achievement of trump s predecessor former president barack obama and since the 2016 campaign trump has routinely ridiculed it as weak and said it wouldn t stop iran from obtaining nuclear weapons while the deal barred iran from developing nuclear weapons it will eventually decrease the so called break out time that it would take if iran were to develop a bomb something it says it will never do trump s top advisers like national security adviser john bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo long time critics of the deal have also said the accord limited the united states ability to counter malign iranian activity in the middle east three months after withdrawal the u s reimposed the first round of sanctions targeting iran s gold and precious metals other metals like aluminum and steel the automotive sector sovereign debt and national currency the rial three months later an even tougher wave of sanctions was reimposed hitting iran s banking and shipping industries and most importantly oil exports iranians buy items to celebrate the upcoming persian new year noruz at tajrish old bazaar in tehran on march 08 2019 rouzbeh fouladi nurphoto via getty images in april pompeo also announced that the administration was designating iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps an elite branch of its military as a foreign terrorist organization the first time that legal label had been used on another government the economic pressure has forced iran s already mismanaged economy to buckle despite double digit growth after the nuclear deal lifted sanctions iran s economy shrank by 3 9 in 2018 according to the international monetary fund inflation has also jumped to 31 in 2018 the imf reported with predictions it could hit 37 or more this year as the value of the iranian rial drops the price of goods has skyrocketed with red meat and poultry climbing by 57 vegetables by 47 and milk cheese and eggs by 37 according to the statistical center of iran the imf projected in april that 2019 would be even worse saying it expected a 6 contraction of iran s economy that forecast came before the u s announced it was tightening the belt even more to mark the one year anniversary of withdrawal the white house announced on may 8 that trump had authorized sanctions on iron steel aluminum and copper sectors which it said comprise 10 of iran s export economy the sanctions could also target financial institutions or foreign countries that facilitate iran s export of those goods a handout picture provided by the presidential office shows iranian president hassan rouhani c attending a parade marking al quds jerusalem international day in tehran on may 31 2019 iranian presidency via afp getty images more importantly the administration announced days prior that it would no longer provide any waivers to countries to allow them to import iranian oil after granting eight nations exemptions in november that means that any country still importing iranian oil could face u s sanctions although so far there have been no penalties the goal is to drive iranian oil exports all the way down to zero because oil revenue accounts for 40 of iran s annual budget according to special envoy for iran brian hook the administration has gotten close last month iranian crude exports dropped to just 400 000 barrels per day according to reuters news agency compared to 2 5 million barrels per day in april 2018 in april the state department estimated that sanctions had cost iran 10 billion in oil revenue in the face of all of that however iran publicly has stood firm supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said wednesday that his country won t negotiate with americans because there s no use negotiating and it s even harmful our only option is to use means of pressure in the face of u s pressures hours earlier president hassan rouhani was more open saying that the road to talks is not closed but that the u s would have to first return to the nuclear deal a nonstarter for trump in the meantime iran is warning it will restart parts of its nuclear program that are blocked under the jcpoa if it doesn t get economic relief in a televised address on may 8 rouhani said that china russia and the european powers have 60 days to improve economic ties with iran or it will keep its excess enriched uranium and heavy water instead of shipping them overseas two requirements of the deal photo in this photo released on wednesday may 22 2019 by the official website of the office of the iranian supreme leader supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei speaks to a group of students in tehran iran office of the iranian supreme leader via ap while u s officials dismissed that as a threat the u n s nuclear watchdog raised questions about iran s nuclear program on friday the international atomic energy agency reported that iran continues to comply with the deal but that its stockpiles of low enriched uranium and heavy water had grown as iran promised the iaea also reported that iran appears to have installed 33 new centrifuges that can enrich uranium more quickly which could violate the deal technical discussions in relation to the ir 6 centrifuges are ongoing the agency said in an assessment according to the associated press still with tension increasing and both sides doubling down some experts think the pressure is getting to the regime and they may be willing to talk outside iran most analysts believe tehran won t bow to trump s pressure and the risk of war is high inside iran many fear the country s economy isn t sustainable and a deal is likelier than war tweeted karim sadjadpour a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace others however think that iran may

stock markets have enjoyed substantial gains and until last september the rally looked set to continue what upset the apple cart was the dismal outlook for global growth and the 10 year bond in the us offering in excess of 3 the trade war between the us and china the issues with huawei and the issue surrounding brexit italy and the european elections then worsened the global growth outlook and put low global interest rate back on the agenda again the us10 year bond yield is back at 2 15 which allowing for inflation is now no alternative to stocks and stock markets are holding up quite well considering but all that could be about to change if bad news outguns the efforts of central banks to promote growth the fears of a markets collapse and a long global recession are back the partnership between the us and china which has shaped global trade for 20 years is breaking down us administrations in the past have given the chinese open access to the american economy in the hope of furthering political freedom and economic liberalisation it hasn t worked trade talks have broken down and positions have hardened on both sides there seems only one remaining opportunity for compromise and that is the g20 gathering later this month by the end of the summer full sanctions will be in place the outcome of the huawei spat is massive for the global economy as it will uncover us policy towards china and the chinese response many think the relationship between these two countries is a so called thucydides trap when an established power finds its interests are in conflict with those of a rapidly rising power this could lead to a total breakdown in co operation and a fall back to another cold war that s not a pretty analysis moreover us president donald trump is threatening tariffs on mexico this could get out of control very quickly trade wars are like a bar fight somebody throws the first punch but everyone ends up getting hit this is the backdrop to which the brexit debacle is playing i have commented on brexit for years now and many times in this newspaper i have always believed that a no deal outcome is very unlikely due to the uncertainty and carnage it entails remember the germans sell the uk about 90bn of goods each year and buy 50bn surely politicians will not jeopardise all this will they the best course of action was always to kick the can and hope the english mindset changes to staying in the uk i believe we can still get there in the end what worries me more is the total destruction of the uk political system i am not particularly politically minded being from a trading background which requires one to always backing the leading horse but a stable government is a must there may be some very troublesome times ahead for those exposed to the uk economy uncertainty is the worst of all worlds and it seems we are in for more than our fair share kicking brexit out a couple of years until there is some stable leadership would be the most welcome outcome for now on mainland europe it has been quiet for a while but italy is back questioning the fiscal rules does it matter probably not with the trade war escalating indeed we may get some very expansionary tones from central banks to offset the damage caused by sanctions either way it is going to be a hot summer peter brown is head of education at iift and managing director at baggot investment partners baggot ie iift hosts an investing educational seminar on june 22 iift ie
there s a saying south of the border that asserts when san diego gets a cough tijuana gets the flu the connection between the two cities has caused fortunes to rise and fall since the mexican city s establishment around the start of the 20th century after a devastating economic collapse during the great recession which was arguably worse in baja california than san diego county the city has seemingly bounced back in recent years residential real estate construction has led to a vertical condo boom with 17 of the city s 20 tallest buildings constructed in the last decade growth in manufacturing and medical tourism have helped swell the city s labor force to a historic peak up 44 percent since 2005 the jobless rate for baja california was 2 8 percent in the first quarter of 2019 said mexico s national statistics institute despite record violence there are still tourism bright spots with national coverage of the city s growing food scene advertisement now in a likely devastating development president donald trump is threatening to impose a 5 percent tariff on all imported goods from mexico beginning june 10 trump said the move is intended to stop undocumented immigrants from coming across the united states mexico border the president said he will increase the tariffs up to 25 percent if he felt progress was not made unlike past troubles in tijuana a city of more than 1 6 million the tariff threat comes at a time when the economy is doing well tijuana s woes usually coincide with some worldwide event and a bad economy in mexico this time any economic crisis would be directly caused by the american government some business leaders in tijuana were dismissive that tariffs would be levied others were defiant that if tariffs are imposed tijuana would bounce back like it always has but many in the city said they have to be prepared that trump will follow through on his threats and alter its economy for years to come there s been more than a few troublesome times in the city s history said tijuana business leader josé galicot behar who has lived in the city since 1946 he said there are numerous examples of the city bouncing back from crisis and the trump tariff threat would be no different behar is the founder of tijuana innovadora an organizer of several economic forums and initiatives in the city and former director of communications company g tel as a longtime promoter of the region he s also a bit of a historian he said the tijuana region saw major growth during the american prohibition after years as a sleepy outpost established in 1889 the city was rocked in 1933 when alcohol was decriminalized in the united states again the city adapted and by the the 1940s growth in navy personnel in san diego fueled business as soldiers flooded the city s bars and casinos even through political ups and downs he said tijuana seemed to continue to thrive especially after the growth of factories or maquiladoras in the 1970s other critical points were the devaluation of the mexican peso in 1994 and modern drug violence behar expects the brunt of tariffs will be felt by americans as mexican businesses will have to increase what they charge for products with a trade war also going on with china he said mexico will still be the united states best bet for cheap manufacturing how this might be different for tijuana tijuana might be a boom and bust town but it is usually tied to a global event as opposed to just tariffs said pepe larroque a partner with the international law firm baker and mckenzie he works out of the tijuana office primarily dealing with commercial and residential transactions he pointed to economic downturns in 2001 and 2008 affecting nations around the globe that also hit tijuana in those scenarios you had situations that affected the whole economy he said this is being forced on mexico he said factories in tijuana are part of a global supply chain that cannot simply relocate on short notice therefore businesses hit with tariffs will likely pass the cost to the consumers until either the tariffs go away or they decide to shift production to another country he said supply chains are not things that you can just retool between now and june 10 he said so initially it s going to have a very significant effect on consumers in the u s because they will affect the prices companies that invested in tijuana factories would only relocate if they believe the tariffs were here to stay and they found more economically viable alternatives when you reach the point where it is less expensive and logistically possible to manufacture elsewhere you re going to see that move he said some of tijuana s manufacturing industries like aerospace and medical devices are shielded from the impacts of the proposed tariffs because they produce high margin products larroque said they are more resistant than other products that are sensitive to any increase he said that provides a buffer that other areas may not have manufacturing ernesto bravo s phone has been ringing nonstop since trump s tweet his job is helping businesses move into mexico and said companies from the united states china and europe have been calling him to find out what the tariffs mean for their operations in tijuana there is a lot of uncertainty right now he said we are waiting with anticipation to see what really happens the growth in manufacturing is seen as a major factor in increasing tijuana s labor force in 2005 there were 509 579 people in the city s workforce by 2018 it was 735 920 said local development council centro metropolitano de información económica y empresarial most of tijuana s manufacturing has transformed into production for components of a larger projects such as for x ray and mri machines bravo said it is difficult to predict what the impact of the tariffs will be mostly because no one knows how high or how long they will be a 5 percent tariff for two months is different than a 25 percent tariff for two years at 5 or 10 percent it isn t good but we can adjust so that companies investors and manufacturing won t have to make drastic changes like looking for other countries for production bravo said but if it gets to 25 percent and it looks like it won t be resolved the impact would be much graver not just for tijuana but the manufacturing industry in the u s as well compared to other bust cycles in tijuana bravo does not think this reaches the level of the great recession of 2008 the impact this could have won t be like the recession he said it won t get to that level where 50 000 manufacturing jobs here in tijuana were eliminated bravo noted that the economic impacts could likely also have social consequences in tijuana for example if unemployment grows south of the border people may seek economic opportunities in the united states it could create more migration to the u s or more unemployment in tijuana which causes social problems he said james gerber an economics professor at san diego state university said manufacturing is particularly sensitive to the world economy therefore tijuana is sensitive to economic cycles the history is that when the u s economy booms it pulls in a lot of manufactured goods from mexico he said mexico is not just the largest exporter of manufactured goods in latin america it exports more manufactured goods than all of latin america combined it is important to note that if the tariffs lead to a bust cycle in mexico that bust would not be connected to global economics instead it would be connected to u s policy gerber said the u s has a long history of influencing mexico s economy through policy for better or for worse for example for a long time the u s deported large numbers of people into tijuana many of these people had no connection to the border city or didn t speak spanish gerber said this has had the dramatic effect of all kinds of ailments of the life in tijuana in terms of street crimes and in terms of unemployment rates he said positives came out of that as well in that there are call centers in tijuana because of those people deported from the u s who speak english gerber said the devaluation of the peso could have a short term effect on both sides of the border in tijuana costs like rent and services like plumbing and electricity are often tied to the dollar that means that if you earn pesos for a living your money is worth less anything that s imported from the u s is going to cost more gerber said in san diego businesses like the shopping outlets in san ysidro that rely on cross border shoppers may see less traffic from tijuana real estate tijuana s residential construction industry has seen a revival in recent years after becoming dormant during the great recession since 2016 more than 1 000 new condos and apartments over 30 residential buildings have risen across the city salomon saul commercial director for one of the city s biggest developers cosmopolitan group said he doubted trump would follow through on the tariff but even if he did saul said it wouldn t affect the real estate industry much buying homes in mexico is different in the united states because interest rates for mortgages are very high around 12 percent this month compared to around 4 percent in the u s so most of the new condos being build are for wealthy mexicans who can afford to put up all the money upfront it s not worth it to get a loan saul said so the kind of people buying condos are unlikely to be overly affected by the tariffs he reasoned developers say the majority of funding for residential projects comes from within mexico so it is somewhat insulated from the ups and downs of international markets but what about the dropping value of the mexican peso reuters reported friday that the mexican peso had erased all gains for the year following trump s tweet sergio arturo gonzalez business developer for the real estate agency probien bienes exclusivos said it has become increasingly difficult for developers to get projects approved in mexico city making tijuana the best option also many new condos are sold in american cash meaning investors can count on the u s dollar instead of the troubled peso gonzalez said he anticipates the demand will only grow for condos in baja california because it has recently become more difficult for people who live in san diego county and own businesses in tijuana to cross u s customs and border protection in mid may opened inspection booths for cars traveling into mexico disrupting what had often been a seamless drive into the nation although the agency said stops will be sporadic drivers have reported greatly increased wait times

1 americans are paying these tariffs we already have two studies by teams of top notch trade economists who have found that the costs of trump s earlier tariffs are being passed along to american businesses and consumers an update of one of those studies pegged the cost of tariffs announced before thursday including the most recent escalation on 200 billion of chinese goods at 831 per u s household it seems reasonable that this latest round of tariffs on mexican goods will also be largely absorbed by americans 2 this will seriously screw up supply chains and hurt american companies including american companies that need mexican parts to make their own products that get sold here or exported abroad mexico recently became our no 1 trading partner two thirds of our imports from mexico are intra company trade i e a firm trading with itself across the border the auto industry is especially vulnerable of u s auto exports about 35 percent of the value added comes from imported inputs according to deutsche bank securities chief economist torsten slok note also that the u s auto industry is already in trouble announced layoffs for the first four months of this year in autos are the highest since 2009 according to challenger gray christmas we don t know the full economic cost of the tariffs but it would be painful for the united states two years ago a research and consulting firm calculated an 3 two years ago a research and consulting firm calculated an estimate for the costs of a similar 20 percent tariff on mexican imports over three years the bill comes to 286 billion in lost value to the u s economy and a loss of 755 000 american jobs two thirds of those job losses would be at the expense of low to medium skilled workers it s not clear the tariffs are legal the white house said its 4 the white house said its legal justification for the tariffs is the international emergency economic powers act this 1977 law is mostly related to sanctions it has never been used for tariffs according to the congressional research service some trade lawyers have suggested that the law does not give the president power to unilaterally impose trade duties 5 mexico does not have power to do the thing trump seems to be asking the country to do he s asking mexico to block people from central america from crossing into the united states to exercise their internationally recognized legal right to seek asylum there is no plan there was never a plan even acting white house chief of staff and office of management and budget director and apparently 6 even acting white house chief of staff and office of management and budget director and apparently new labor department overlord mick mulvaney acknowledged this in a call with reporters when asked what it would take to remove the tariffs he said the decision would be ad hoc 7 this new self inflicted trade war wound gives us less leverage in negotiating a new trade deal with china and the european union and japan both of which we re also simultaneously trade warring with the tariffs will damage our economy and encourage already suffering trade dependent sectors including agriculture and manufacturing to place more pressure on the administration to reach a deal as soon as possible basically it makes our stated willingness to absorb a little more trade war related pain less credible since we ve absorbed so much pain already 8 it will also damage our ability to negotiate with china and the e u and japan because it proves once again that trump can t be trusted to keep his word including in the form of a signed international agreement everything from mexico recall that trump had previously said that his global steel and aluminum tariffs would stay on our friends in canada and mexico until a new north american free trade agreement was signed but after it was signed last fall he still didn t remove the tariffs finally two weeks ago under pressure from lawmakers he did remove them only to turn around and announce fresh across the board tariffs onfrom mexico mexico negotiated the new nafta in good faith and then was punished for it why would anyone ever make a deal with this president one that required literally any concessions given this track record 9 the decision to impose tariffs and thereby harm red state farmers and manufacturers could cause a rift with the republican lawmakers who have been protecting him to be sure they ve supported him through the trade wars so far but at some point even they might break especially if they think another trade war front could jeopardize their own reelection chances 10 if trump does indeed manage to wreck the mexican economy that would likely increase the flow of immigrants trying to cross the border into the united states when the mexican economy is lousy after all demand to come to the united states rises donald trump was not happy with just putting a hidden tax on american consumers by placing tariffs on products from china now he is proposing substantial tariffs on mexican products he will place a 5 tariff on june 10th and raise that tariff by 5 each month until it reaches 25 in october he says the tariffs will last until mexico effectively blocks central american refugees from coming to the united states which mexico has little control over trump and his cohorts want you to believe that the new tariffs on both china and mexico will be paid by those countries that is a huge lie the tariffs are paid by the u s companies that import chinese and mexican products and are then passed on to u s consumers in the form of higher prices not a single penny will come out of the mexican and chinese treasuries to pay these tariffs these new tariffs are stupid and will do nothing to stop refugees from trying to come to this country catherine rampell in gives us 10 reasons why these new tariffs are mind bogglingly stupid

analysis from our powerhouse roundtable we ll break down the politics smoke out the spin the facts that matter this week unidentified male from abc news it s this week here now chief anchor george stephanopoulos end video clip stephanopoulos good morning and welcome to this week we have a lot to get to this morning but we begin in an all too familiar place mourning the victims of another mass shooting in america here are the 12 killed in a government building in virginia beach late friday laquita brown ryan keith cox tara welch gallagher mary louise gayle alexander mikhail gusev joshua hardy missy langer richard nettleton katherine nixon christopher kelly rapp herb snelling bobby williams the victims and their loved ones in our thoughts this morning ph we will not name the shooter as we confront what has become a deadly epidemic and we begin with the police chief of virginia beach james cevera chief cevera thank you for joining us this morning our condolences to your entire community in addition to the 12 victims we also know there were four injured what more can you tell us about their condition this morning and the latest on the investigation james cevera virginia beach police chief we do know that three of the victims who were wounded are still in critical condition one is in much better condition our fingers are crossed and our prayers are going out that that winds up in a positive outcome for all of them as far as the investigation goes we re currently in what we call the evidence recovery mode the fbi has sent a team of some 40 investigators on our evidence recovery team to assist us actually they now have the lead at this point so all the forensic techs from out city evidence recovery techs from the fbi are still in the crime scene in the building i have to let you know it s a large building and because it s an older building the inside is a honeycomb maze of offices that have been added and some deleted as time went on when the building was first constructed they ve been in there for since the initial shooting and my my deep honor goes out to the work that they re doing right now to put this whole case together from this end stephanopoulos none of us want to give the shooter any more attention than he deserves but from what you ve discovered so far anything more on the motive or whether anything could have been done to prevent this tragedy cevera we don t have anything additional on the motive we re now interviewing co workers witnesses family members anyone who will step forward maybe to give us some additional background i appreciate the fact that we re not mentioning his name we did it once that s the last time we re going to do it as far as additional information on the case like i said we re working every angle we possibly could remember this is an open government building and he s an employee of the open government building so he has access through his card to get into numerous places that the general public would not be allowed into so he had full access to the building stephanopoulos and he obtained the guns legally as well at least some of them we know the shooter used a sound suppressor what difference did that make and do we need more restrictions on gun accessories like that cevera the sound suppressor is just that so someone in one end of the building would not have heard a gunshot going off as opposed to another end of the building but again this is a very large building that might not have been an issue in this particular case as far as you know more legislation on on gun issues i m a member of major city chiefs we did publish something about a year and a half ago i don t think most of that would have mattered in this particular case we do have the second amendment it is very stringent for our country in this particular case the weapons were obtained legally everything was done in a legal manner by this individual stephanopoulos and your officers responded with their training quite quickly saved lives you ve been in law enforcement now 44 years this has hit home for you and your force this morning what is your message to the country cervera well my message is this the first four officers that made entry made entry into that building within few minutes of that initial call going out other officers responded to search other parts of the building the team that made the entry that eventually confronted the suspect made that entry began to clear out the first floor realized where the suspect was on an additional floor they immediately engaged with him it was a long gun battle for lack of any other word what we would call a long firefight they stood their ground they held their ground he was moving they were moving this wasn t something that you would think of in most police officer involved shootings and also everyone has to remember this isn t a choreongraphed movie or tv incident it was real it was violent it was going on those cops stuck themselves in that place to stop him from committing more carnage in that building one officer was wounded i checked with him yesterday he s doing just fine and they were able to take the individual down and yes it was a fatality but we also have to know when they realize he was injured he was down they then switched over to first aid for that particular individual because cops across the country believe in the sanctity of life and they belive that they re the ones that put themselves in harm s way for other individuals and that s exactly what those young cops did stephanopoulos every single day chief thanks for very much for your time this morning cervera thank you sir stephanopoulos and we are now joined by senator michael bennet one of the 23 democrats running for president this year senator bennet thank you for joining us this morning you just heard the chief right there kind of laying out the difficulties facing those who are calling for moregun restrictions like you what difference can a president make here we know president obama supported more gun restrictions couldn t get it done sen michael bennet d co 2020 democratic presidential candidate thanks george thanks for having me i think a president can make a big difference here look we just the house of representatives have passed background checks to close the gun show loophole and the internet loophole this person bought the guns lawfully as we know and every single fact pattern is going to be different but we should pass those background checks 90 percent of the american people support it but we know what s going to happen which is the house has passed it mitch mcconnell will not allow it to come to a vote in the senate and we will not have national background checks after columbine in colorado the people of this western state voted to close the gun show loophole and the internet loophole that was 20 years ago george and every single year about 2 or 3 percent of the people that try to buy a gun in colorado are stopped and these these people are rapists and murderers and convicted felons of one kind of another and it s impossible to argue that our state is not safer as a result of this law so my hope is that if mcconnell does not take this on the floor that the america people and the people of kentucky will hold him accountable for that and that we can actually put leadership in the senate and the white house that will do something about this stephanopoulos you re not the only coloradoan in the race your former boss when he was mayor of denver john hickenlooper is also running of course he was governor of colorado as well and yesterday he got a pretty rough reception at the california democratric convention when he denounced socialism i want to show it begin video clip john hickenlooper former governor of colorado let me be clear if we want to beat donald trump and achieve big progressive goals socialism is not the answer i was re elected booing end video clip stephanopoulos you heard those boos right there you know at state of the union you applaudedpresident trump when he said america will never be a socialist country are you worried that you and john hickenlooper are out of step with the base of your party bennet well i think john might not wanted to have denounce socialism in san francisco that might be the last place that you d want to do it i don t think i m out of step i was not applauding donald trump i was applauding the idea that this country will not become a socialist country i think we have 230 years of being the longest lived democracy on the planet that s something we need to preserve and it is becoming harder and harder for us because we have had 40 years of no economic mobility in the united states 90 percent of the american people 90 percent george have not shared in the economic growth over the last 40 years for them those periods of economic growth has acted as an recession and as a result they can t afford the basic components of the middle class life and on top of that if you re poor in this country your chances of getting into the middle class are lower today than they ve been in generations that is tearing at our democracy and if we don t figure out a way to begin to address that to reestablish in this country the idea that when the economy grows everybody s income grows we re going to have real problems and so i don t think we need to call it socialism or not doesn t matter what we need is a country where everybody has a share in our prosperity stephanopoulos but it s not only rhetorical difference there are real substantive differences as well he was also booed when he took on the idea of medicare for all that it s going to take away private health insurance from so many millions of americans that s your position as well again the base of the party seems to be going in another direction bennet well actually i think the twitter universe in the party is going in another direction the base of the party that i ve i ve been meeting with in new hampshire iowa and just yesterday in south carolina they don t think we should take insurance away from 180 people they absolutely categorically do not agree that bernie is right on that and i don t think bernie s right on that i think he s wrong i remember when we voted on obamacare i was there and we all said if you like your insurance you can keep it and thousands of people in the country lost it because they had insurance that didn t prevent people with preexisting conditions from being bounced from their health insurance and it was a political catastrophe now we re saying look if you like your insurance the democrats are going to take it away from you and replace it with a government plan that s not going to be acceptable to people if you want universal healthcare which i do i just i just had a prostate cancer operation myself and i feel very strongly about this if we want universal healthcare i think we re a lot better off saying to the american people you have an option for your family and for you to decide whether you want to be on a public plan mine is called medicare x or on a nonprofit plan which is what i m now kaiser or a for profit plan if we tell the american people we have to take it away from you before you can have universal healthcare it s never going to work and that s not because by the way single payer is a bad idea it s because we have an existing system of insurance today if we had no existing system i think we should be having a different conversation but i just yeah stephanopoulos i know you re hoping to be the i know you re hoping to be the nominee so is bernie sanders can you support him as a democratic socialist if he gets the nomination bennet i absolutely can support him and i can support him wholeheartedly if it means we re going to beat donald trump stephanopoulos you think a democratic socialist can beat donald trump bennet well i think the only way we re going to lose to donald trump is if we disqualify ourselves and that s why that s why these issues around how we approach universal healthcare how we approach climate change we as democrats we have to build a broad constituency in the country not just of democrats but independents and republicans to overcome trump we should never have lost to trump we lost to a climate denier he should have been disqualified from office just on the basis of that yet we lost on a jobs argument to a guy who is threatening to or you know promising to drag us back into the 19th century we have to go ahead stephanopoulos to make this case you re going to have to get on the debate stage right now you re having you haven t qualified yet there are two criteria 65 000 donors want to show a chart here from 05 38 65 000 donors you need 1 percent in at least three national polls they say it could be tough for you to make this debate even tougher to make the third debate where they re going to double those criteria you confident you re going to be able to get on bennet well i hope so i only got in the race four weeks ago so george i m behind and anybody who wants to help we d love to have the help but i also think i hope the dnc sort of takes a look at this and reconsiders i mean i have won two really tough races in colorado a swing state a purple state in the west i ve chaired the democratic senate campaign committee i raised a record amount of money while i was doing that i ve been in the senate for 10 years and i think the tragedy for adding voices to the democracy if we re basing it just on what people can raise on the internet in just a handful of weeks i just don t think it makes any sense i mean you should see george the e mails that people are sending out to try to get fundraising contributions i mean the desperation is unbelievable and has nothing to do with putting democrats into a strategic posture to win the white house from donald trump which is where we need to be stephanopoulos senator bennet thanks for your time this morning bennet at least i think that s where we need to be stephanopoulos thank you for sharing your views this morning bennet thanks for having me stephanopoulos up next tensions high between the united states and iran martha raddatz is in tehran for an exclusive interview with iran s foreign minister we ll be right back commercial break stephanopoulos amid rising tensions between the u s and iran martha raddatz was able to enter iran for an exclusive interview with the foreign minister she joins us now from tehran good morning martha martha raddatz chief global affairs correspondent abc news good morning george we have not been here since donald trump was elected and pulled the u s out of the nuclear deal and what a difference we have seen begin video clip it was nearly four years ago that the iran nuclear deal was announced we were on the streets of tehran that night surrounded by iranian people full of hope these people are so happy that these punishing sanctions will eventually be lifted and sanctions were lifted double digit growth quickly followed but today in tehran there is little to celebrate with the sanctions back in place the iranian economy is in dramatic distress here in tehran s grand bazaar there seems to be all kinds of goods and plenty of food but the problem is now the prices are astronomical prices for red meat and poultry are 57 percent higher vegetables 47 percent milk cheese and eggs a 37 percent increase what have the sanctions done to you unidentified female very bad very bad raddatz among the young people here a majority of the population fears of war seem to be dwarfed by the crippled economy are you worried about finding a job unidentified female i m actually worried about everything in my life right now because i cannot see any future ahead of me raddatz we asked iran s foreign minister about trump s so called maximum pressure campaign when we sat down with him this morning it looks like it s having a devastating effect on the economy javad zarif iranian foreign minister well president trump has called it in fact economic war i call it economic terrorism and the reason i call it economic terrorism is that it targets ordinary iranian people raddatz president trump says he wants to talk he has invited iranian officials to give him a call how likely is that zarif it s not very likely because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure he is imposing pressure this may work in a real estate market it does not work in dealing with iran raddatz if you did come back to the negotiating table would you trust the united states would you trust president trump zarif the last experience was not very optimistic and does not provide an optimistic perspective for a future agreement so this is what i believe is happening to the national community that is people think twice before they talk to the united states because they know that what they agree to they may not hold to mark raddatz on friday the international atomic energy agency said iran is in compliance with the original nuclear deal but the iaea is also raising questions about new centrifuges in iran and the u s has accused iran or its proxies of sabotaging four oil tankers near the persian gulf charges zarif disputes if the united states decides to declassify some of its intelligence if they show images which some officials say exist of cruise missiles being put on small iranian boats will you simply dismiss that and not believe it zarif no no no i believe you see we call this place the persian gulf for a reason so it s next to us we have the right to defend ourselves just imagine if iran were to come to california coast or to come to florida coast how do you feel ph how would you treat that these ships are located very close to our waters we have the right to put whatever missiles we want to put on them raddatz you ve talked about escalation and that there would be dangerous consequences what kind of consequences are you talking about with the united states zarif well i like to keep president trump guessing because he likes everybody in the world to keep on guessing about what is happening in the united states you hear to one day something coming from the white house the next day something else coming from the state department since they want us to continue guessing let them continue guessing too raddatz what would you say to president trump zarif i ve said it before threats against iran never work never threaten an iranian try respect that may work end video clip raddatz foreign minister zarif says iran would only act out of self defense but that can have a very broad definition george stephanopoulos and it doesn t sound like a lot of negotiations anytime soon martha thanks very much when we come back after robert mueller s surprise press conference the debate over impeachment front and center in the house we ll take that on next commercial break stephanopoulos the impeachment debate is next with congressssman adam schiff and jim jordan we ll be right back commercial break begin video clip mueller the opinion says that the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing william barr attorney general the opinion says you cannot indict a a president while he s in office but he could have reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity end video clip stephanopoulos very different views there from william barr robert mueller want to talk about that now with congressman adam schiff the chair of the house intelligence committee chairman schiff thank you for joining us this morning i know you re coming to us from san francisco this morning site of that state convention yesterday and i want to show everyone house speaker nancy pelosi speaking at that convention and almost getting drowned out by calls for impeachment let s listen begin video clip pelosi the report lays out of 11 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president of the united states as end video clip stephanopoulos and now you ve been supporting the speaker as she holds the line against impeachment but the pressure is building can you hold the line rep adam schiff d house intelligence committee chairman well look i think we re going to do what s right for the country and at this point the speaker has not reached the conclusion and i haven t had either it s best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know is destined for failure in the senate now that calculus may change if the president continues to stonewall if the president continues to demonstrate his unfitness for office there may be little additional cost to going through that process it is in a way even if unsuccessful in the senate the ultimate form of censure in the house but we re not there yet and i think if it is a close call close calls go against putting the country through that we have an important legislative agenda to try to advance we have important oversight work we can do outside the context of impeachment and i think at this point that is still the preferred course stephanopoulos but it would still it could still strengthen your hand against the department of justice in court and and opening an inquiry isn t the same as reaching a final judgment on impeachment why does the evidence laid out by mueller require at least opening up that inquiry schiff well of course mueller didn t say that what he was presenting required impeachment in the same way he didn t comment on the question of indictment and by the way i think bill barr is completely disingenuous in saying that it would have been perfectly fine for mueller to say the president was a criminal i just can t indict him if that s the way barr feels then perhaps he should let the southern district of new york know that they can say individual 1 the president of the united states should be charged when he leaves office but in terms of the the impeachment process it s not mandated by the constitution we can avail ourselves of this when the president demonstrates acts that are high crimes or misdemeanors it is certainly true i think that much of his conduct qualifies for that but at the same time we have to recognize the reality that one party the republican party has turned itself into a cult of the president s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations and we have to figure out in that context is this the right thing for the country and i m just not convinced not yet that that s the case stephanopoulos what might help there is hearing from robert mueller before the congress where do things stand with getting his testimony schiff well i was disappointed to see during his statement the other day such a profound reluctance to testify now i understand that but i think he has one last service to perform it s not enough merely to speak for 10 minutes and say i m not going to answer questions for the congress and the american people there are a great many things that are not in the report we want to find out what happened to those counterintelligence findings that were sent back to headquarters what other things did you learn during the investigation that ought to concern us in terms of whether the president is vulnerable to influence from russia does the president still did you find evidence whether the president still intends to build a trump tower in moscow is that why that financial inducement why the president can t criticize putin or take adequate steps to protect our elections there are any number of questions that we have every right the american people have every need to have answered here so i hope that bob mueller will understand as painful as it may be and as much as it may subject him to further abuse by the white house he has a final duty here to perform like any other witness and it s my hope that he will do so and it s my hope that he will do so voluntary stephanopoulos and if he doesn t subpoena schiff well it will be my recommendation yes but i hope that is not the case that will be a decision really that we ll have to make collectively and with our leadership whenever there s use of compulsion because it may lead to litigation but i would hope none of that is necessary that s not how this process for bob mueller should end he s a dedicated public servant and i hope that he ll come and testify voluntarily stephanopoulos meantime the attorney general has made it pretty clear that he s going to continue this investigation of the investigation here he was earlier this week begin video clip william barr attorney general of the united states sometimes people can convince themselves that what they re doing is in the higher interest the better good they don t realize what they re doing is really antithetical to the democratic system we have end video clip stephanopoulos he hasn t reached a final judgment but he s made it pretty clear he s suspicious something went very wrong at the start of this investigation schiff well ironically of course that statement you heard from bill barr is a perfect description of his own conduct he s willing to cavalierly throw out terms like spying and pretend he doesn t know just how pejorative that term is he is a smart man and understands exactly how incendiary what his allegation is and it s designed to be that s why he is i think falling into such legitimate criticism for acting as effectively a henchman of the president you don t talk cavalierly about intelligence agencies or the fbi spying on presidential campaigns and given how much he mislead the country about mueller s own report and findings we can sadly expect that given this power to declassify information now he will do in a selective way designed to mislead the country and the president s service and there may be no opportunity for rebuttal this time there will be no further mueller report that will set straight this selective declassification that he may put into effect and the fact that he will say he doesn t want to speculate about what went on early in the investigation until he knows but he s willing to speculate that it was spying tells you all you need to know about how disingenuous he s being with the country stephanopoulos chairman schiff thanks for your time this morning schiff thank you george stephanopoulos let s hear from the top republican on the house judiciary committee the ranking republican on the house oversight committee jim jordan from ohio thank you congressman m for joining us this morning you just heard chairman schiff there very suspicious of the attorney general rep jim jordan ranking member oversight committee jucidiary committe r ohio attorney general is going to get to bottom of this thing he said four things six weeks ago in from the senate finance committee george four things i thought were very important first he said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the fbi that is definitely true comey fired mccabe fired under investigation lied three times under oath chief counsel jim baker demoted then left the fbi currently under investigation by the justice department lisa page demoted and left the fbi counsel and of course deputy head of counterintelligence peter strzok demoted and then fired so there was definitely a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the fbi then he said three other things that everyone should pay attention to he said spying did occur he said second that there s a basis for his concern about the spying that took place and then maybe most important he used two terms that should scare all your viewers he used the unauthorized surveillance and political surveillance and he s going to find out if all of that actually happened the evidence seemed to suggest that it did stephanopoulos well we don t know that yet but we will find out from his review what they find meantime we ve also heard from robert mueller he laid out four incidents in the obstruction of justice section of the report that met all three criteria for obstruction of justice an obstructive act connection to an investigation corrupt intent does that concern you jordan look bob mueller had 22 months 30 million 19 lawyers 40 fbi agents 500 witnesses 2 800 subpoenas if he could have accomplished obstruction he would have done it he couldn t do it that wasn t his finding regardless of what the officer of counsel told him at the at the department of justice what they can do with a sitting president or not if he could have established obstruction of justice he would have done it he didn t do it bill barr said that that there wasn t obstruction of justice deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said the same darn thing stephanopoulos well that s not what robert mueller said though and he laid out the evidence are you going to are you concerned enough to take a look at the evidence jordan no i ve read the i ve read the report i m looking at the evidence but what i want to look at and this is what bill barr wants to look at this is what john durham is now charged with finding i want to look how this whole thing started i want to look why they put someone next to george padapoulos someone pretending to be somebody else this azra turk individual to find out what was going i want to i want to learn about that i want to learn about why they didn t tell the fisa court this is something i want to ask bob mueller if he ever comes and testifies did you actually explore the dossier they took the dossier to the secret court didn t tell the court the clinton campaign paid for the document didn t tell the court the guy who wrote it christopher steele had told the fbi he was desperate to trump so i want to i want to find out about that and i know bill barr wants to as well and that s why he s doing the investigation he s doing stephanopoulos they did say that there was indication of political motive behind the funding the dossier but you just said you wanted to hear from robert mueller so you believe he should testify jordan i mea that s up to jerry nadler i know this i got questions for him i think the one question most americans want to know when did you first learn there was no obstruction or excuse me no collusion the the central charge of bob mueller the central task was to find if there was any collusion between the trump campaign and russia stephanopoulos actually he says he didn t look at collusion that s not what he said when he spoke in his report it says very clearly he didn t examine that question what he did say is that he could not establish a conspiracy between the trump trump campaign and russia jordan say ok so when did you know there was no conspiracy no coordination no call it what you want those those have been interchangeable for the last two years so when did you know there was no conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia we knew when we deposed jim comey when we deposed jim comey he said all the way up until the day he was fired may 9 2017 he told us they had no evidence of any type of conspiracy collusion or coordination between the trump campaign and russia and that was after 10 months of fbi investigating him that was after that was after putting azra turk next to george papadopoulos that was after using the dossier to spy on the trump campaign via carter page so after 10 months if they couldn t establish collusion how long did it take bob mueller and if you learned this early on why did you wait almost two years before you told the country there was no conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia to influence the election after all that was your central focus your central task of this entire special counsel investigation stephanopoulos so jordan so that s a question i think the whole country has for bob mueller stephanopoulos he didn t he didn t bring in an indictment of roger stone until the end of the process you don t know that he didn t that he had reached that conclusion early jordan i don t know but but i do know what jim comey told us and he said after 10 months of the fbi looking into this they had no evidence of any type of coordination conspiracy or collusion between the trump campaign and russia to impact the 2016 election so after 10 months he didn t know how long did it take bob mueller with 19 witness or 19 lawyers most of them were democrats who were out to get the president how long did it take him to figure it out that just i think that s a question most members and frankly most people in this country would have for bob mueller so if he comes that s something that s going to get asked stephanopoulos we will see if he testifies congressman thanks for your time this morning jordan you bet stephanopoulos roundtable s up next we ll be right back commercial break begin video clip mayor pete buttigieg d south bend indiana democrats can no more keep a promise to take us back to the 2000s or the 1990s than conservatives can keep a promise to take us back to the 1950s rep eric swallwell d california let s invest in hope in these places we don t need a crime bill we need a hope bill sen elizabeth warren d massachusetts some say if we all just calm down the republicans will come to their senses but our country is in a time of crisis the time for small ideas is over end video clip stephanopoulos democratic state convention yesterday in california democrats taking their first shots at the frontrunner joe biden their veiled shots perhaps let s talk about it on our roundtable joined by our chief political analyst matthew dowd rachael bade congressional reporter for the washington post lanhee chen policy director for the romney 2012 campaign now a fellow at sanford s hoover institution and jen psaki democratic strategist who was communications director for president obama and that is interesting to watch the footage yesterday from the democratic convention out there in california it does appear that we re heading into a new phase of this democratic race matthew dowd abc news political analyst yes and i think everybody should keep in mind that every time we show an audience in one place it doesn t necessarily represent the broad audience in some allowance ph i take california democratic party activists are much different than somebody in new hampshire stephanopoulos well you heard you have michael bennet call them the twitter democrats dowd and i think still that we don t understand fully what where they really want do they want a new progressive do they want establishment ground ph i think that s still unknown i think we are in a new era and a new time mainly because we re about to start the debates and i think those debates are really what s going to just separate from sort of the top four or five from everybody else and i think the first one s you know this month then july and then the ones that are on abc abc in september i think that s the time when somebody that s not in the top tier right now can break through and come through in this or elizabeth warren could separate herself from bernie sanders and how joe biden does i think the debates will determine really more fundamentally anything else where we go stephanopoulos in the mean time a fundamental question jen for joe biden of course you worked with when you were in the white house it s posed by dan balz in the washington post this morning can he be the candidate of change which usually works for democrats jen psaki former obama communications director it s more challenging for him no doubt i think you know he was criticized for not going to california he made a decision to go to ohio and that s a strategic call but i think for joe biden i ve watched a lot of his speeches he s appealing to people people like him but a lot of it feels like the kind of speeches that john kerry gave in 20014 and i think he s going to need to update his message he s going to need to give a more forward looking message i think they re thinking about that internally which is good but right now he s they re factoring in nothing changing with the rest of the field and as matt said i think the debates seeing some of these candidates rise and have their own moment some of these candidates that have been doing a lot of town halls are very fresh with the kind of questions that will come up like pete buttigieg or even beto o rourke who s been a little off the radar they could have good moments in the debates and i think joe biden has to be prepared for that stephanopoulos one of the debates that s already breaking through rachel bade you covered on capital hill this debate over impeachment we saw nancy pelosi kind of get drowned out there but within her caucus she still has a lot of support rachel bade washington post congressional reporter that s right and pressure is building on her there s no doubt about it after robert mueller came out and basically said verbally what he had written which was that he didn t feel he could make a decision on obstruction and basically kicked to congress people saw that as a referral and more and more democrats are coming out but pelosi s the boss and pelosi doesn t want to go there she is still worried that the senate would acquit him and there s all evidence showing that they would and you know there s sort of a split screen right now you re seeing actually in these swing districts there s a lot of attention being paid to california and you know what happened yesterday with people saying impeach impeach impeach but you know i was out in some of these trump districts that are held by democrats that make up pelosi s majority this week nobody was talking about mueller nobody was bringing up impeachment and that is exactly why pelosi doesn t want to go there she s worried it will blow back stephanopoulos and that is why she calls it a gift to donald trump it is really a gift does he really want to be impeached lanhee chen romney ryan 2012 campaign policy director i think it s a gift because it feeds into the kind of energy that the president you know on the campaign trail when he s out there doing events the more he s able to feed on that energy from democrats who say yes they want to impeach me yes they only want to come after me i think that does help his cause i think that is frankly really in his wheelhouse in terms of how he appeals to his electorate more broadly speaking though i think that the challenge for democrats is presenting an alternate vision right that really is what this campaign needs to be about and the more they re talking about impeachment the more they re talking about trump and mueller the less opportunity i think they have to present that issue stephanopoulos that s a fair point but matt how do they balance this out i mean for a lot of democrats who ve read the whole report they look at those instances of obstruction of justice say you can t send the message that a president is above the law how do they balance out the politics which could be negative of impeachment versus their responsibilities as members of congress dowd well first i think that both sides of the aisle i think should be confronting this we have a tendency to ask the democrats what are you going to do on impeachment what are you going to do on impeachment and we let the republicans off the hook like you re not doing anything stephanopoulos well and you saw congressman jordan is very comfortable saying he s not concerned dowd yes other as opposed to his one of his members justin amash who basically said well you ought to start running this and i think that s a question too for the republican side of the aisle is do you are you unwilling to hold the republicans accountable in any of this i think the democrats have i mean if you listen to the democrats on the campaign trail they talk very little about impeachment and they talk a lot about a lot of issues guns which is obviously in the news today healthcare and a lot of number of other issues i think there is a way to talk about this which is basically the president should be held accountable impeachment is one option impeachment is one option but there are many other options to hold the president accountable and we as a congress are going to both legislate pass legislation that we ve tried to do over the course of the last three months and investigate and i think that s the way to talk about this just say impeachment is one option but the president needs to be held accountable stephanopoulos and is it inevitable is speaker pelosi as more events unfold over the coming months perhaps the testimony of robert mueller going to have no choice but to at least open proceedings psaki well i think the door is still open and the perception that pelosi has closed the door i think is wrong and same with many moderate democrats out there there is certainly a building a building support for impeachment but i think pelosi also i mean she has gotten to where she is because she has very astute political instincts and she knows how to get rid of opponents her calculation is this is not the way to do it and if that doesn t change i don t think her position is going to change and she ll still have members with her stephanopoulos one of the questions will be will she be able to get robert mueller to testify you ve spent a lot of time talking to members about that this week bade yes they re in a pickle because everybody thought after the report came out that mueller would be the one bright spot they knew they would be going to war with the white house they knew the white house was going to try to block testimony from aides that had talked to him documents but everybody thought mueller would come in and you know he s made it clear he doesn t want to and there s a reluctance you can see it i hear it when i talk to my sources that about subpoenaing him i mean he s basically saying that they might have to right because he s not willing to appear in public right but they don t want it to look like he did something wrong there s a concern that they could look over aggressive there s a concern that they could bog down their investigations by getting caught in this back and forth and some people frankly privately want to kind of move on and so this is an issue though because americans overwhelmingly think 3 4 of americans in the latest polling want to see mueller testify they want to hear from him and when he speaks he has an impact we saw that last week and so it s an issue for them stephanopoulos meantime william barr is really filling that vacuum do you think that robert mueller at some level misjudged his old friend and colleague william barr and was almost surprised by the lengths that barr would go to in the way he characterized the mueller report chen perhaps perhaps i mean i think it s always difficult because now the attorney general s maybe in a different position than when he and mueller first developed that relationship but look i think the question on mueller is do we actually think he s going to say anything else of substance i mean he s already come out and said look the report speaks for itself maybe if they have him in closed session he might say a few other things but he s aware of the fact that he s restricted from revealing what might be a currently operative case if there s grand jury information he s probably not allowed to reveal that either so what do we really expect bob mueller s going to tell us or tell members of congress that s really actionable in moving the ball forward on stephanopoulos does tv ph make a difference bade it does though because a lot of americans have not read the report psaki yes bade and you know and that is having him up there at a at the witness stand talking about don mcgahn getting a call from the president and saying you ve got to get rid of mueller that people watch there s a difference you know the democrats are saying there s a difference between reading the book and watching the blockbuster film and i think we saw that last week dowd well and that s what i think ultimately bob mueller s message was is listen you have everything you need just read the report right his message was i got the thing done i put it all together congress do your job read the report read the report read the report and i think you re right i think the vast majority of americans haven t read the report i would bet the vast majority of people in washington d c sitting in power in the halls of congress have not read fundamentally read the report i think bob mueller s right you have what you need now decide psaki i would say this is a clear easy call for democrats i think i was very surprised by how muted they were when mueller said he wasn t going to testify they need to push on it they need to subpoena him if needed it s about repeating what s in the report because people aren t paying attention but there are some clear questions that can be asked that he can give yes or no answers to he can give a little bit more context there s more that needs to be said and i think for him we owe him a great deal of thanks but his duty as public service as adam schiff said is not done and we can t accept it you can t say you re not letting the president of the united states off the hook and then drop the mic and go on vacation he owes us more bade this also relates to impeachment as well because you know democrats say they need to build the case to the public the public is not on board with impeachment right now but in order to do that if they want to do that they ve got to have people testifying they have to have people in the witness chair and they don t they haven t had anyone yet stephanopoulos inaudible dowd if i were if i were the democrats george tomorrow morning the thing i d be talking about is gun reform after what happened in virginia beach i would just say ok we can give this a break for 24 hours about bob mueller but we ve now had another tragedy we ve passed a bill in the house of representatives it may not do everything it will do something it s time to act for republicans on this stephanopoulos meantime the president is talking about tariffs and mexico about to relaunch his campaign as well in a couple of weeks and lanhee i want to talk to you about that he s got clear sailing now except for inaudible on the republican side john kasich this week said he s not going to challenge him larry hogan governor of maryland said he s not going to challenge him the economy so far still a strength for the president is he putting it at risk with these calls on tariff on china and mexico chen you know i think this is the big challenge for the president is that is he trading off some short term potential gains for really long term trouble in the economy if you think about the tariffs there s an argument in short run he gets mexico to table on immigration it certainly seems like president lopez obrador is saying we re willing to make some concessions on immigration but in the long term does that mean he doesn t get usmca the revised nafta trade deal which really would be important for the economy does it mean with china for example he wants that short term deal at the expense of the longer term relationship with china i think that s really the big x factor for this president in this coming election is what s going to happen to the economy and how much of this is going to end up being self inflicted i think the president has an opportunity here to focus on some of these economic themes but by mixing for example immigration with trade now i really think he s putting that at jeopardy stephanopoulos hitting some of his own voters farmers across the midwest also the stock market is not the economy but since he s been talking about these tariffs over the last months about a 5 6 percent drop psaki that s right and i think the politics of the economy is to build on what you were saying what you just eluded to i mean the imports are not just avocados right they are auto parts and trucks and manufacturing parts and states like michigan and parts of the midwest as you said there are places in the country that will be deeply impacted could be deeply impacted by these tariffs it also won t address the root cause issues so maybe in the short term mexico may come to table i don t know i ll be surprised but at the same time he s still threatening to cut off funding to honduras and a lot of these country people are coming over because they re facing such terrible conditions so this is a short term gain in that regard even as well dowd i think his instincts on the trade deals back in the campaign were actually right on which is the trade deals over the last 20 years have not necessarily benefited working class people whatever those trade deals were and there s a lot of people stephanopoulos they certainly don t feel they have dowd and especially in the industrial midwest where he put together where they felt suffered under these trade deals that helped big business but did not necessarily help the working class but i agree with lanhee there doesn t seem to be real strategy here a long term strategy of how do we put together deals and if we should use tariffs and how do we revise these deals stephanopoulos to build on that point the president just hours before he announced those tariffs had actually signaled to congress he wanted them to try to work on the revised nafta bade yeah bipartisan both republicans and democrats are very confused by these moves i think the one strategy we could see from this is that again reinforcing the 2020 for trump is all about immigration and following through on a campaign promise to do something at the border he has gotten rid of a whole bunch of leaders at dhs he has used an emergency declaration to build the wall he has threatened to cut off aid to these countries where the migrants are coming from nothing is working and so now he s trying to shift the blame to mexico to say it s their fault but really what needed to happen was he needed to do a bipartisan deal with congress and he walked away from the table on immigration when it came to a bipartisan deal a lot several times over the past few years stephanopoulos and that seems like that s not going to happen any time soon that is all we have time for today thank you all very much before we go we honor our fellow americans who serve and sacrifice in the month of may one service member died overseas supporting operations in afghanistan and that s all for us today thank you for sharing part of your sunday with us check out world news tonight and i ll see you

this summer the nation is expected to celebrate an impressive milestone the longest economic expansion in the nation s history beginning in the wake of the great recession it will surpass the 120 month record recorded from 1991 to 2001 it fills me with dread why because this expansion has been squandered leaving individuals and the nation collectively terribly vulnerable when the next recession arrives an expansion this long should have been an opportunity to grow the middle class for families to build up financial cushions and for the nation to begin cutting into the debt none of that has happened another year of economic expansion and low national unemployment rates did little to narrow the persistent economic disparities by race education and geography notes the federal reserve in its latest report on household fiscal well being the same report found an american working class highly dependent on maxed out credit with four in 10 people saying they wouldn t be able to scrape together 400 to meet an emergency expense in many ways they mirror their government over the coming decade the united states ranks first among advanced economies in the projected growth of its national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product projections show debt rising from 78 percent of gdp now to 92 percent by 2029 if various set to expire tax cuts and spending hikes are continued which is usually the case the debt will be 105 percent of gdp come 2029 many other advanced countries project debt reductions germany as high as 10 percent what happens when a recession hits people lose jobs and need a financial cushion to meet minimal expenses despite the record expansion and an employment rate of 3 6 percent that is the lowest in 50 years many americans don t have it in recessions deficits get worse as government must provide unemployment benefits demand for social programs expands and federal spending is necessary to try to restart economic growth yet in good times the country is facing explosive growth in deficit spending the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget warns that if the debt continues to climb at some point investors will lose confidence in the government s ability to pay back borrowed funds they would demand higher interest rates on the debt and at some point rates could rise sharply and suddenly both major parties share the blame for this situation with tax revenues covering only two thirds of federal expenses the rest going on the national credit card however the republican initiative when in control of the house senate and presidency to approve massive tax cuts in 2017 was particularly reckless there was no need to spur the economy it was already growing there was no attempt to offset the tax cuts with spending reductions no wonder then the deficit is rapidly expanding a new congressional research service report concludes the tax cuts had little impact on overall economic growth and instead exacerbated the growing gap between the very rich and the rest of us they provided a corporate windfall from 2017 to 2018 the estimated average corporate tax rate fell from 23 5 to 12 1 and individual income taxes as a percentage of personal income fell slightly from 9 6 to 9 2 states crs the tax cuts contributed to a record breaking surge in corporate stock buybacks crs found but little in worker wage growth as for the tax cuts paying for themselves the crs found they produced an increase of 0 3 percent in gross domestic product in 2018 at most to pay for themselves an increase of more than 6 7 percent would have been necessary our best hope the expansion continues forever paul choiniere is the editorial page editor
in 1991 the late harvard political scientist samuel huntington wrote an influential essay in the journal of democracy entitled democracy s third wave huntington s essay published several months prior to the fall of the soviet union surmised that modern democracy was associated with waves of democratic growth followed by reverse waves of autocracy he identified a long first wave beginning in the 1820s characterized by a global increase of male suffrage that continued until the 1920s this first wave was subject to a reverse wave beginning with the rise of fascism first in italy and its subsequent spread through western europe and japan a second wave of democratization occurred after the allies defeat of fascism in world war ii this second wave would peak in 1962 when a smaller reverse wave again occurred from 1960 75 during heightened tensions of the cold war the mid 1970s saw the emergence of a third wave of democracy beginning with the carnation revolution in portugal in 1974 and the gradual transition to democracy in post francisco franco spain which held free elections in 1977 this third wave continued with the rise of democracies in eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 and the decline of autocratic rule throughout much of south america the third reverse wave currently though democracy around the world is in the midst of another reverse wave characterized by a slow sustained growth in autocracy three reports analyzing the state of democracy suggest democratic institutions practices and culture are under assault the economist s democracy index 2018 report me too political participation protest and democracy notes that as a percentage of the world s population 47 7 percent of people lived in some form of democracy in 2018 a decrease from 49 3 percent in 2017 the report identified three indicators of this decline rising voter disillusionment with political institutions the denial of equal participation to minority groups in the political system and citizens disengagement from mainstream political parties the report found only 4 5 percent of people in the world live under a full democracy but the economist report was not all bad news political participation has risen throughout the world especially among women who are playing an increasingly important role in many of the world s democracies in general however the report suggested global democracy remains under threat another report freedom in the world 2019 s democracy in retreat has recorded 13 consecutive years of decline in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world this decline is most pronounced in east european countries that were once part of the soviet bloc and considered resistant to autocratic rule after many became democratized during the 1990s freedom house noted that several countries experienced democratic growth in 2017 however a dire warning was issued hostile forces around the world continue to challenge the institutions meant to protect political rights and civil liberties and the damage accrued over the past 13 years will not soon be undone democratic institutions practices and culture are under assault finally the v dem institute s annual democracy report 2018 democracy for all published at sweden s gothenburg university provides comprehensive analyses of historical patterns of democracy over a period of 228 years from 1789 2017 the v dem report likewise found troubling patterns regarding the current state of democracy in the world although levels of democracy are close to an all time high freedom of expression media freedom and civil society institutions are under attack according to the report autocratization the decline of democratic attributes affects 2 5 billion people and is gaining momentum the report further notes that democracy peaked around 2004 and for the first time since 1979 the number of countries backsliding on democracy is again the same as the countries advancing globalization and the rise of autocracy this third reverse wave has emerged in a context in which global integration multilateralism and the diffusion of culture and technology have been the dominant forces of the last four decades globalization was predicated on the idea that implementing policies devoted to the free trade of goods services and ideas would unify the planet stimulate economic wealth throughout the world and spread democratic governance although globalization was marketed to promote human development and well being on the one hand it came into direct confrontation with structural economic factors the flow of capital unregulated corporate power transformative demographic changes resulting from global migration and the rise of political movements associated with cultural identity and national sovereignty multilateral trade agreements and the institutions that oversaw them paid only lip service to issues like workers rights environmental protection and equity for the first time since 1979 the number of countries backsliding on democracy is again the same as the countries advancing the creation of statutory mechanisms to ensure transnational institutions and multinational corporations would develop policies to protect against social dislocation and the environmental impact of their actions was rarely addressed measures to establish fair and equitable distribution of wealth that was generated during a period of exponential technological and economic growth was rhetorically acknowledged in trade agreements but not enforced through legal codification not surprisingly modern globalization has been marked by a widening chasm between rich and poor and regional dislocations in economic and social development within developing and developed countries in essence as globalization evolved it became a force for exploitation inequity and hegemonic power relations on a global scale the neoliberal economic policy agenda a principle driver of the globalization process created a bifurcated world order trade liberalization government deregulation privatization of government programs and fiscal austerity has ravaged working class communities in both developing and industrialized nations the greatest tragedy of contemporary globalization is that its architects are also its beneficiaries the global political and economic elite according to the 2018 world inequality report since 1980 the top one percent captured twice as much global income growth as the bottom fifty percent transnational institutions such as the world bank the international monetary fund and the world trade organization have made little attempt to address growing levels of inequality and the political dislocation associated with it political elites in western democracies have ignored growing inequality in their societies as they choose to push a concerted neoliberal agenda that focuses on austerity measures leading to severe cuts in social programs that negatively affect the economic prospects of the poor working and middle classes the greatest tragedy of contemporary globalization is that its architects are also its beneficiaries the global political and economic elite in the end the ideals of globalization have become usurped by a shortsighted perspective that plutocrats and corporate largess can somehow transform the world as anand giridharadas has shown in his book winners take all global economic and political elites are incapable of transforming society because they refuse to accept that systemic change requires a recognition of their role in creating many of the problems they are attempting to change creating protocols to end poverty or promote gender equality in the workplace sells in corporate boardrooms but is much more difficult to enact in reality giridharadas also notes that while elites often work with admirable intention they rarely invite key stakeholders into the decision making process thus the status quo becomes an enduring principal the status quo has become the target of right wing populist s political mobilization in europe and the united states the status quo has become the target of right wing populist s political mobilization in europe and the united states as far right italian interior minister and deputy prime minister matteo salvini stated shortly before elections for the european parliament we want to save the europe that doesn t have anything to do with bureaucrats bankers financiers and with those who have been in power in salvini s vision saving europe requires a nationalist agenda that closes borders engages in xenophobic fear mongering islamophobia and skepticism whereas a cosmopolitan united europe is neither beneficial nor functional although far right populists gained ground in the election these parties did not perform as well as many polls predicted they would the increase in the number of populists in the eu parliament will undoubtedly lead to more political fragmentation and polarization ultimately weakening prospects for european unity given that far right parties are far from unified on issues such as immigration and russian influence in europe it is unlikely they will be able to have a significant impact on eu policy making a more likely scenario will see populist parties taking on the role of obstructionists working to block progressive eu policies beyond their well known anti migrant and nationalist agenda insight into the populist political agenda exists in countries where they have gained power for example in hungary prime minister viktor orbán has made systematic efforts to eliminate an independent judiciary and weaken the role of the media as a check on government power the electoral system has also been manipulated to favor orbán s party fidesz in national elections in poland the law and justice party pis has rescinded women s rights since gaining power in 2015 according to human rights watch pis leaders and civil servants have championed retrogressive laws and policies sought to reinforce traditional gender roles disparaged feminism and publicly discouraged efforts to combat violence against women carl bildt co chair of the european council on foreign relations told npr the greens and the liberals were the winners of the day regarding the european elections it appears the eu dodged an electoral bullet however for a number of european countries italy poland hungary belgium and france the threat of autocracy is real and growing before you go

nearly 15 million union members nationwide and young people professionals and people of color bringing new energy to the movement unions are showing they can still be a formidable force the resurgence in labor activism picked up steam in the fall of 2011 when the occupy movement brought to light the fact that a disproportionate amount of the country s wealth belonged to the wealthiest 1 percent but without resources or a clear cut vision the movement fizzled out within a few months the following year the service employees international union launched the fight for 15 and the ensuing protests by

white collar jobs by tom krisher associated press may 20 2019detroit ford revealed details of itsplan monday as it prepared for abywhite collar workers worldwide about 10 percent of its global salaried workforce the major revamp which had been underway since last year willby eliminating bureaucracy and increasing the number of workers reporting to each manager in the united states about 2

largely in and around the company s headquarters in dearborn mich just outside detroit the layoffs are coming across a broad swath of the company including engineering product development marketing information technology logistics finance and other areas but the company also said it is hiring in some critical areas including those developing software and dealing with self driving and electric vehicles in a memo to employees monday chief executive jim hackett said the fourth wave of the restructuring will start on tuesday with the majority of us cuts being finished by may 24 to succeed in our competitive industry and position ford to win in a we must reduce bureaucracy empower managers speed decision making and focus on the most valuable work and cost cuts hackett wrote it s thefor

another 8 000 white collar workers worldwide about 6 000 blue collar positions were cut but most of laid off factory workers in the united states will be placed at other plants mainly that build trucks and suvs both companies have said the cuts are needed because they face huge capital expenditures to update their current vehicles and develop them for the future at gm the cuts brought withering criticism from president trump and congress especially the closing of a small car factory in lordstown ohio trump campaigned on bringing factory jobs back to the industrial midwest gm has since announced a possible deal to sell the lordstown plant to a startup electric vehicle maker but it hasn t been finalized ford s white collar employees had been fearful since last july when the company said the restructuring would cost 7 billion in cash and hit pretax earnings by 11 billion over the next three to five years many have been upset that it took so long for the company to make decisions factory workers have not been affected by the restructuring thus far as the company has retooled car plants so they can build more popular trucks and suvs the while large morgan stanley analyst adam jonas predicted 25 000 white collar job cuts late last year a number that ford would not deny hackett said in the memo that ford iss andlaid off employees stay a few days to wrap up their jobs andto colleagues in the past laid off workers would have had to pack up and leave immediately ford is a family company and saying goodbye to colleagues is hackett wrote hackett told workers that under the restructuring managers now will have seven people reporting to them on average up from five before changes were initiated began that reduces management bureaucracy by one third from before

federal reserve may cut interest rates in the future however the uptick in the aussie could be cut short later tonight as the reserve bank of australia s concludes its june policy meeting with economists widely expecting the back to implement a rate cut of its own meanwhile the pound opened this week on the defensive after the uk s latest manufacturing index revealed uk factory activity unexpectedly contracted in may gbp aud fx update the british pound to australian dollar exchange rate crept higher on monday following four successive weeks of declines with sterling last seen trading at au 1 82209 up a meagre 0 07 from last week s close overnight aussie data put the aud on the back foot into monday s session with quarterly corporate profits shrinking to 1 7 down from 2 8 job advertisements falling by 8 7 and a dip in the pace of commodity price growth all weighing furthermore the continued risk off market undertone in the wake of trump s fresh escalation of us mexico trade relations and nothing to indicate an end to the us china spat likely to curb enthusiasm for the antipodeans looking ahead it s a stellar week for releases particularly for the aussie dollar with retails sales the reserve bank of australia gdp growth and trade figures all due while the rba held pat on rates at their previous policy review expectations of a cut have been growing amid continued concerns over the health of the global economy and the impact of trade wars a cut to the record low 1 50 cash rate would likely come as a blow to the aud for the uk monday will see the latest manufacturing pmi forecast at 52 5 while the key focus remains politics and brexit with president trump heading to the uk for a three day state visit and brexit comments already forthcoming from the impulsive president he ll likely be the focus of media attention as the tory leadership contest grinds on in the background the pound to australian dollar exchange rate fell along with the majority of its other peers this week as political uncertainty in the uk weighed heavily on sentiment advertisement sterling sentiment softened as analysts warned that may s departure is likely to have increased the risk of a no deal brexit as bookmaker odds suggest the chances of one of the multiple hardline brexiteers entering office are high further pressure sentiment in the mid week were also comments from bank of england boe deputy governor dave ramsden regarding the bank s recent growth forecast addressing businesses in scotland ramsden said he was more pessimistic on growth than the boe following its may policy meeting as he warned productivity and investment were likely to undershoot expectations this year ramsden said relative to the best collective judgment expressed in the mpc s central forecast i am a little more pessimistic on gdp growth than my colleagues on the mpc australian dollar aud exchange rates boosted by surging iron ore prices the australian dollar aud got off to a solid start against the pound gbp last week with the aussie being boosted by rising commodity prices this was mostly led by iron ore australia s single largest export which rose to 108 62 a tonne a five year high while the iron ore rally began to fade as the week went on the australian dollar was able to maintain its upward trajectory against sterling this came despite an escalation in trade tensions throughout the session as china threated to restrict rare earth metal exports to the us and the white house shocked markets by slapping a 5 tariff on all exports from mexico gbp aud exchange rate forecast could the rba cut interest rates next week looking ahead the pound australian dollar gbp aud exchange rate may look to mount a comeback next week as the reserve bank of australia rba concludes its june policy meeting on tuesday this comes as economists forecast that the rba will likely cut interest rates this month as the bank attempts to tackle the country s sluggish inflation and stubbornly high unemployment however it may be the bank s forward guidance that applies the most pressure to the aussie as investors look for any signs that this month s rate cut could be the first of up to two this year analysts at anz said the rba governor is speaking in sydney on tuesday evening we and the market will be shocked if the rba doesn t cut in june of more interest will be any clues it might provide about action beyond that if the post board meeting statement doesn t provide any clues attention will switch to the governor s speech that evening meanwhile the pound may get off to a slow start next week with the uk s latest pmi figures expected to show that growth in the private sector remained close to stagnation in may on top of this the appeal of sterling is also likely to be tempered by the ongoing political uncertainty in the uk with the race to replace theresa may likely to heat up next week as she steps down as the leader of the conservatives on friday
gold standard federal reserve economic law in a recent opinion by sebastian mallaby published in the washington post the author and columnist says the following money is an abstraction a political confection a set of castles built on air no wonder it makes people feel queasy gold is tangible immutable somehow reliable and real there will always be people who believe in it but the truth is that modern central banking is one of those elite inventions that generally works the gold standard has given way to the phd standard and we are all the better for it in his article mr mallaby presents his arguments as to the reason and logic that a gold standard will not work and that it is an idea which is out of date and inferior to the current system i e modern central banking the opinions are a response to statements made by judy shelton currently under consideration for appointment as one of the seven governors on the federal reserve board mr mallaby refers to former president reagan s nostalgia abut the gold standard as being curious and says that survival of this sentiment in 2019 is even more baffling how so what is so baffling about recognition of the ill effects of the current system and the realization that there is a better way he goes on to state that the fed has a remarkably good record in delivering price stability seriously in the lifetime of the federal reserve the u s dollar has lost more than ninety eight percent of its value is the fact that it costs sixty times more today than it would otherwise without the the effects of inflation a sign of a remarkably good record in delivering price stability further why is it necessary to manage and administer price stability it is necessary for central banks because they are the ones who create and foster instability in prices inflation is the debasement of money by government it leads to a loss in purchasing power in currencies and price instability the effects of this inflation are cumulative volatile and unpredictable all governments with the help of their central banks inflate and destroy their own currencies it is intentional and ongoing modern central banking embodies operation and actions that are refutations of fundamental economic law paper currencies are substitutes for real money they have no intrinsic or inherent value paper money is a debt an i o u that is irredeemable except for more money substitutes these things are also true of any amounts of dollars or other currencies that are held in the form of credit u s treasury securities for example and are denominated in dollars ms shelton and others have suggested that fixing the dollar s value to a specific quantity of precious metal will keep the fed from creating money at will no it won t sorry goldbugs if that were true then it would have been entirely unnecessary for president roosevelt to declare it illegal for u s citizens to own gold and for president nixon to refuse further convertibility of u s dollars into gold by foreign governments those executive orders were the result of people s preference to hold gold rather than paper dollars the reason for their preference was because the dollar was no longer good as gold regardless of fixed ratios or any supposed backing by gold that is because the government continued to issue dollars paper money that was in excess of the amount of gold which was used for the backing it is called counterfeiting that does not mean that a gold standard cannot work it can work and it is certainly preferable to fiat money and modern central banking and sooner is better than later but there are problems which seem to escape the proponents of a sound money system one is the fact that as with all illnesses a recovery period is necessary a withdrawal period might be a better term one hundred years of illness will require a long period of withdrawal and it will be very severe that is due to the fact that most of the inflation effects by the fed are built into unrealistically high prices for nearly everything we buy and sell also most of those prices and nearly all economic activity today are supported and funded with credit the credit is in the form of mortgages student loans auto loans business and corporate loans leveraged investments etc and the credit is growing exponentially our financial and economic systems are top heavy and will likely collapse under their own weight that is what happened in 2007 08 then the fed rescued us per mr mallaby without the fed s prodigious quantitive easing the economic recovery after the 2008 crisis would have been even more sluggish the 2008 crisis would not have just been even more sluggish it would have led to a full scale depression and we would likely still be mired in it deeply which nobody wanted then nor do they want it today or ever i get that when people get sick they generally don t want to do what they need to do in order to get better rather than let nature take its course and have the body heal itself they resort to drugs and other quick fixes then they resume some mediocre level of activity and go back to whatever they were doing before they got sick in many cases they suppress the symptoms that indicate the system is purging itself and ridding the body of toxins but the pathogen which might be the cause of the illness doesn t go away it remains in the body in a relatively dormant state until it awakens sometime later in full fury the fed s response to the 2008 crisis was similar to a drug addict who is hooked on higher and higher doses when his body rejects further infusions voluntarily or not he enters into a period of withdrawal if he refuses further fixes he has the possibility of healing himself and curing his addiction but it will be difficult and it will take time the fed responsed to the 2008 crisis with more of the same rather than face an undetermined period of withdrawal and potential healing the patient received huge repeated doses of a similar drug that had been made available since 1913 and coincided with the origin of the federal reserve in support of the supposedly valiant efforts by the federal reserve in their response to the 2008 crises mr mallaby said that the alleged downside of qe a surge in inflation has failed to materialize with all due respect to mr mallaby the inflation did materialize and it was huge the combination of cash and credit issued to stave off economic collapse was the inflation the effects of that inflation higher prices also showed up stock prices have quadrupled since their lows in early 2009 house prices have recovered and exceeded previous high points from a dozen years ago in some cases house prices have doubled from their recession lows and the levels of outstanding credit are at all time highs as long as governments issue fiat money there will always be inflation and currency manipulation and the intent and actions including inflation and currency manipulation of governments and their respective central banks are attempts to control economic activity out of self interest and perpetuation of power we don t need a global monetary system tethered to gold we need the freedom for participants in all trades and transactions to accept or refuse whatever form of money they choose gold is real money it has earned that distinction over five thousand years of recorded history it is real money because it meets the test of qualifying criteria it is a medium of exchange a measure of value and a store of value nothing else meets the test whether it is recognized officially by governments or not whether a gold standard monetary system is in place or not gold is money it is real money original money all paper currencies are substitutes for gold and there is historical precedent for that claim therefore editing mr mallaby s summation from his article here is a more factual and suitable conclusion for this author s opinions paper money is an abstraction a political confection a set of castles built on air no wonder it makes people feel queasy gold is tangible immutable always reliable and real there will always be people who know and understand this the truth is that modern central banking is one of those elite inventions that is guaranteed to fail all similar attempts in history have also failed unfortunately the gold standard has given way to the phd standard and we are all the worse for it by kelsey williams kelsey williams is a retired financial professional living in southern utah his website kelsey s gold facts contains self authored articles

investing com while trade developments and their impact on financial markets are likely to remain to the fore this week market participants will also be looking ahead to the latest u s jobs report monetary policy updates from a number of central banks including the european central bank and u s president donald trump s state visit to the u k here s what you need to know to start your week 1 trade war fallout trump announced surprise on friday and tariffs on 200 billion of rose on saturday to 25 from 10 with tensions in the global trade war showing no signs of easing investors fear that the global economy is moving closer to a recession bond markets are flashing a warning with u s yields now well above rates the so called curve inversion that s foretold most 20th century u s recessions may was the first month in the red this year for global and u s stocks the intensifying trade war may have dealt a blow to the federal reserve s hesitance to react to global trade tensions are currently pricing in two quarter percentage point fed rate cuts before the end of the year fed officials are holding a two day conference in chicago this week to discuss how they set monetary policy but the focus on how best to meet its mandate of stable inflation and full employment is likely to be overshadowed by the near term demands of battling the impact of the trade war 2 u s nonfarm payrolls friday will see the release of the u s nonfarm payrolls report for may after a recent batch of mixed economic data the consensus forecast is for the economy to have added jobs and the unemployment rate to have held steady at other notable data releases on the economic calendar include the on tuesday the fed s and the report on wednesday and a report on the on thursday 3 draghi to give boost to economy president mario draghi will give the euro zone economy a bit of a boost on thursday in the form of generous loans to banks so they keep lending to businesses while also leaving the door wide open to even more stimulus the outlook for the euro area economy has darkened the global trade war is showing no signs of dissipation is once again in conflict with the european commission german industry is continuing to post dismal figures stocks are tumbling inflation expectations are falling and the threat of a hard brexit looms large but first quarter growth came in well above expectations and bank lending continued to move higher indicating that any revisions to the ecb s economic projections are likely to remain modest we think that the governing council is likely to sound more dovish than these projections would warrant morgan stanley said in part this is because the downside risks rather than economic are political in nature ranging from trade policy to domestic politics and geopolitics 4 trump s state visit to u k trump said britain should refuse to pay its 39 billion pound european union divorce bill and from brexit talks if brussels does not give the u k what it wants in an interview with the sunday times newspaper ahead of his state visit to britain starting monday trump will be hosted by queen elizabeth ii and will also meet outgoing prime minister theresa may widespread protests are planned in the u k during his visit trump repeated his backing for those candidates to succeed may who have said britain must leave on the due date of oct 31 with or without a deal 5 reserve bank of australia to cut rates australia is expected to become the second advanced economy to start cutting interest rates this week the reserve bank of australia is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a record low after its meeting on tuesday which would be its first cut in three years we would be very surprised if the rba did not kick off its easing process at the meeting on 4 june markets are certainly geared up for it with bloomberg showing the implied market probability of a cut standing at 87 2 at that meeting ing said by august markets imply more than a 50 probability of a further cut we concur by then the rba will have received more data on inflation as well as further labor market information meanwhile the reserve bank of india is also expected to cut interest rates at its meeting on thursday lowering the repurchase rate to 5 75 from reuters contributed to this report
detroit automakers face billions in lost profits from tariffs on imports from mexico announced thursday by president donald trump an assessment said friday morning the deutsche bank industry update and analysts said general motors is the most vulnerable followed by fiat chrysler automobiles and ford trump tweeted that he would impose escalating tariffs on mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop aiming to pressure mexico to block migrants fleeing central america and seeking asylum in the united states a 5 tariff will begin june 10 but would be removed if mexico takes effective actions to alleviate the illegal migration crisis which will be determined in our sole discretion and judgment trump said in a separate statement issued by the white house however if the crisis persists tariffs will increase to 10 on july 1 trump also said in the statement and increase monthly until they reach 25 on oct 1 stocks react trump threat of tariffs on mexico pushes stock futures lower bad for small business here s why tariffs are extra bad for smaller businesses tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 level unless and until mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory the white house statement said the tariffs would fall hard on the auto industry which accounted for 26 of the 350 billion in u s imports from mexico last year deutsche bank warned that the impact on the u s auto industry would be particularly substantial automakers may indeed see large financial impact and uncertainty from the tariffs as all major automakers import a considerable portion of the vehicles they sell in the u s from mexico they also use large content imported from mexico in the vehicles they produce in the u s deutsche bank said in an industry update but u s automakers would be worse off than the japanese and korean carmakers particularly gm and fca we believe the high volume content of full size pickup trucks manufactured sources in mexico and sent to the united states may surprise investors who typically think the only real exposure is passenger cars deutsche bank said the update estimated that if the automakers absorbed the full cost of 25 tariffs the potential annual profit hit would be on 3 3 billion for ford 6 3 billion for gm and 4 8 billion for fca passing the costs on to consumers would raise the price of vehicles roughly 2 400 for gm 2 200 for fca and 1 600 for ford deutsche bank said factoring in foreign brands the average consumer price increase is calculated at 1 300 per vehicle mexico pushes back mexico president tells donald trump america first is a fallacy in response to tariff threat it said the tariffs could cut u s vehicle sales by 3 million as the industry already faces a moderate downturn with the u s auto market already softening and all the tariff impacts that have already been imposed this additional layer of tariffs will only further weaken u s automakers and suppliers as they are concurrently are being weakened by lower sales volumes said jon gabrielsen a market analyst who advises automakers and suppliers he pointed out that u s sales the past three years have been at a peak above 17 million but in april were at an annual rate of about 16 5 million a loss of 3 million for a full year would cut sales about halfway to the great recession low point of 10 6 million in 2009 industry reacts u s automakers deferred comment to the american automotive policy council which said we are strong supporters of the administration s united states mexico canada agreement because it makes significant improvements to the nafta but it relies on duty free access to be successful the imposition of tariffs against mexico will undermine its positive impact and would impose significant cost on the us auto industry john bozzella president and ceo of global automakers an industry group representing foreign automakers operating in the united states said the tariffs would cost consumers money and endanger jobs threatening to increase taxes on products american consumers and manufacturers buy from mexico will raise costs and quickly threaten the jobs of tens of thousands of americans here in the united states he said rather than solving problems at our southern border or improving the environment for passage of the president s recently negotiated usmca these new proposed tariffs only increase the uncertainty already faced by american autoworkers and other manufacturers another industry group the alliance of automobile manufacturers which represents about a dozen automakers including the detroit three volkswagen and toyota said that tariffs are a tax on consumers and hurt the economy the auto sector and the 10 million american jobs it supports relies upon the north american supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive this is especially true with auto parts which can cross the u s border multiple times before final assembly alliance interim president and ceo dave schwietert said in a statement any barrier to the flow of commerce across the u s mexico border will have a cascading effect harming u s consumers threatening american jobs and investment and curtailing the economic progress that the administration is working to reignite just two weeks ago trump lifted tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from canada and mexico seen as a key step in winning approval in congress and canada of the u s mexico canada agreement meant to update the north american free trade agreement white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said the new tariffs were completely separate from usmca because one pertained to immigration and the other trade the associated press reported but the threat drew a withering response from republican sen chuck grassley of iowa a usual trump ally who slammed it as a misuse of presidential tariff authority that would burden american consumers and seriously jeopardize passage of usmca trump also has threatened to impose 25 tariffs on vehicles imported from europe and japan contributing further to uncertainty in an industry that plans billions in investments in products and manufacturing years in advance as significant as the impact may be of ever changing and increasing tariffs are the huge and most pervasive issue is the never ending uncertainty it drives gabrielsen said jessica caldwell executive director of industry analysis at edmunds com said the uncertainty is magnified because the administration has not provided an achievable and measurable objective for the mexican government in terms of what does success look like that hasn t been defined what exactly is he looking for asked caldwell noting that operations at the border are massive in 10 days time what is supposed to occur for the tariffs not to happen vehicles made in mexico cox automotive chief economist jonathan smoke in a piece published on the company s website in april noted that most vehicles assembled in mexico come from american brands in 2018 mexico assembled 2 5 million vehicles that were sold in the u s of those mexican vehicles sold in the u s 57 were domestic makes two of these domestic makes general motors gmc brand and fiat chrysler s ram brand see about 40 of their u s sales coming from vehicles actually assembled in mexico according to smoke he noted that 41 of the rest of the vehicles assembled in mexico and sold in the united states are from foreign automakers with substantial manufacturing in this country these brands are volkswagen nissan toyota honda mazda infiniti kia and hyundai in fact 15 of the total u s sales from these foreign makes come from vehicles assembled in mexico two thirds of the volkswagens sold in the u s last year were assembled in mexico smoke said noting that these vehicles otherwise considered american japanese german and korean likely have a larger percentage of content coming from the u s from their related factories based in the u s dingell peters criticism u s rep debbie dingell d mich called the president s latest tariff plan absurd tariffs are economic tools used to balance trade immigration policy is about humanitarian needs of those fleeing violence and war as well as ensuring farmers the hospitality industry and businesses get the workers they need our immigration system is broken but we don t need tariffs to fix it we need tough effective border security permanent protections for dreamers and humane policies that don t tear families apart tariffs are threatening the very trade deal the president is trying to pass dingell said u s sen gary peters d mich also expressed concern i m concerned about the impact of the president s proposal on michigan workers and our auto industry it s unclear how this will strengthen security at the southern border and it does nothing to address the root causes that are driving migration from central america peters said auto stock prices reflected the concern at midday friday with gm down 4 3 at 33 31 fca down 5 1 at 12 72 and ford down 2 6 at 9 48 overall the dow jones industrial average was down about 1 trump tweeted friday that tariffs will either force mexico to crack down on immigrants passing through its territory or lead companies to move production to the united states
in its latest appraisal of potential risks to financial stability in the eurozone the european central bank ecb warned that risks are rising amid a slowing global economy and escalating trade tensions the report known as the financial stability review fsr cautioned that weaker than expected growth and a possible deterioration of international trade relations could trigger further falls in asset prices on eurozone sovereign debt the fsr noted the vulnerable countries are set to face higher financing costs should the downside risks to growth materialise and that could lead to the re emergence of debt sustainability worries the report also said that bank profitability in the eurozone is expected to remain low in the next two to three years meanwhile germany s unemployment rate rose unexpectedly in may the first increase in more than five years in a sign that the labour market is mirroring the slowdown in europe s largest economy the seasonally adjusted jobless rate increased to five per cent in may from a post re unification low of 4 9 per cent in april data published by the federal employment agency showed on wednesday economists forecast that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged in internationally comparable terms the may figure translates into an unemployment rate of 3 2 per cent below the 3 6 per cent rate recorded in the us for april the most recent month for which data are available finally in the us consumer confidence rose by more than expected in may rising to the highest level since november of last year in the meantime americans felt the most upbeat about their current economic conditions in 18 years amid a robust labour market and rising wages the conference board s consumer confidence index climbed to 134 1 in may according to data published by conference board last tuesday the figure exceeded economists estimates the index that measures the present situation increased to 175 2 the highest since december 2000 while the gauge for expectations for the future situation rose to a six month high of 106 6 however richard curtin chief economist at surveys of consumers noted that the preliminary data was gathered mostly before the us china trade talks collapsed this report was compiled by bank of valletta for general information purposes only
marco revelli i agree with this general framing the anti populist anti sovereigntist forces who support the current european political order did well we saw this both in the netherlands and with the liberal democrats result in britain but the main systemic parties fell back in the eu s french german core in particular in germany the spd fell from 27 to 16 percent and angela merkel s cdu lost more than 6 percent in france the socialists and the gaullist right also saw heavy setbacks indeed the socialists have disappeared almost entirely all this opens up further cracks in the european structure if the old main parties of center left and center right are declining the forces that supposedly stand outside this divide are in fact hardening as clearly on the right this is especially true where such parties are tested in government take the italian case in the march 2018 general election m5s took 32 percent and the lega 17 percent but today their scores are almost the exact opposite salvini has won votes not by being a moderate but by ostentatiously showing off his hard right credentials he attacked migrants and closed the ports risking criminal proceedings against himself and in his milan rally before the election practically called on the crowd to boo the pope faced with these results pro europeans have little reason to cheer if in austria the government was felled just a few days before by a corruption scandal the far right minister at the center of this heinz christian strache lost only a couple of points in the election in france le pen s rassemblement national has practically wiped out the moderate right occupying the whole political space left open by macron this has not benefited the populist left jean luc mélenchon s france insoumise a kind of left sovereigntist party suffered heavy setbacks and even if portugal and spain are a countertendency to the general european picture podemos s plan to conquer the left has failed it was instead the center left psoe which made up ground and in barcelona the catalan nationalists ousted left wing mayor ada colau in recent years an opening did indeed emerge for a left wing challenge to the european policy balance but that would have been based on a mediterranean axis united by a common opposition to the northern countries austerity policies it would have stretched from syriza in greece to podemos in spain the left wing coalition in portugal and perhaps also some sort of socially inflected populism in italy and the sizable protest movements in france but this axis was broken before it could ever be realized in greece the middle classes used tsipras to save themselves in the moment of crisis but as we now see they have gone home to the corruption polluted right wing new democracy meanwhile italy has not joined an anti austerity axis across the mediterranean but rather been absorbed into the visegrád group of central eastern european countries led by hard right governments

significant as the impact may be of ever changing and increasing tariffs are the huge and most pervasive issue is the never ending uncertainty it drives gabrielsen said jessica caldwell executive

obaseki transforming edo with production centre initiative the call to industrialise and create jobs especially for the youth is gaining momentum in edo state where governor godwin obaseki has established a multi purpose production centre reports ambrose nnaji the ever pressing need to break the ground in fast tracking industrialisation and economic diversification has led many state governments to tinker with diverse industrial models with a number of them recording negligible successes this trial and error approach has led to the creation of industrial clusters or zones that dot the country all of which analysts say are facing numerous challenges ranging from ill thought out policy measures decaying infrastructure little or no incentives for investment or in fighting among initiators policy flip flops and other man made errors have made it difficult for these clusters to provide conducive environment for innovation and production to foster the growth of small and medium enterprises smes this is cast against the backdrop of what obtains in other climes where deliberate government policies have resulted in the creation of industries as evedenced in countries like india the united states europe and elsewhere in edo state governor godwin obaseki has pooled resources to set up the edo production centre an industrial cluster for over 200 smes in the sapele road axis of benin city fitted with 24hour electricity as an incentive to boost productivity the governor is focused on repositioning the state as an industrial hub in nigeria by creating the environment to stimulate manufacturing expand the space for youths to be engaged in productive activity and promote inclusive development over 200 msmes berth the production centre is an initiative of obaseki to provide a multipurpose production facility with conducive environment for manufacturers to work in clusters the multipurpose production cluster will serve as hub for micro small and medium scale enterprises msmes in the state according to the senior special assistant ssa to the governor on jobs creation and skills development mrs ukinebo dare at the one stop shop and production centre to be located across the three senatorial districts of the state msmes will enjoy economies of scale and low cost of production some of the major attractions include constant electricity good road network security solar powered street lights and other business support services so as to boost capacity to produce at scale create more jobs and deepen industrialisation the cluster is also expected to aggregate different manufacturers with sections for welders metal and fabrication polythene cut printers woodwork recyclers shoemakers among others the site of the production centre in edo south senatorial district is located along the sapele road axis of benin in a formerly abandoned government warehouse refurbished by the obaseki led administration the facility of four blocks has been described as the future of production to accommodate local manufacturers when the centre eventually opens for business in june it will host over 200 smes involved in fabrication furniture making printing and polythene production and a number of other interested small business owners mrs dare explained that through the production centre initiative obaseki is focus on encouraging the growth of small scale businesses to spur economic growth and create jobs and wealth for the people as it only makes more sense to groom local manpower as step to attract big investors by creating the enabling environment for everyone to work harmoniously with the right policy framework mrs dare added that the initiative is being set up by the state government with support from the bank of industry boi mend and benson idahosa university commissioner for physical planning and urban development hon edorodion oye erimona noted that aside being a one stop shop for msmes to enjoy economics of scale and low cost of production the centre will accommodate msmes clusters while the benin industrial park will host big industries the electricity that will be at the hub will be drawn from the ossiomo power purchase arrangement pollution in the environment will be minimal at the businesses will be msmes another key factor in favour of the initiative is that it would provide conducive environment for the development of other business clusters which will serve as incubation centres for new businesses in the state the centre is also expected to bring many small businesses together that will cooperate with each other in an attempt to efficiently share resources such as electricity information materials water energy infrastructure and other resources and help achieve sustainable development with the intention of increasing economic gains and improving the quality of lives for edo people the production cluster would feature facilities designed to drastically reduce cost usually incur during production increase income for small business owners while at the same time reducing the price of goods and services in local economy and growing foreign exchange earnings for the state and country for obaseki the production centre will enable his administration assists entrepreneurs into small scale production cut down on cost of production and grow their businesses with ease in accessing finance and funding from financial institutions this is in fulfilment of his promise to ensure a conducive environment for businesses to thrive and improve the quality of lives of the people this will also complement the obaseki led administration goal in driving industrialisation of the state and undeniably revolutionise the state s economy a unique attraction at the centre according to obaseki is the provision of uninterrupted power supply to the facility as the state government has made arrangement for provision of 24 7 electricity to assist owners of small scale businesses eliminate initial setup cost on electricity as entrepreneurs are set to commence operation at the centre three 500kv transformers have been installed at the facility to demonstrate the governor s promise to provide 24 hour electricity at the center the head energising edo mr paul okungbowa said the 500kv transformers will be connected to the 33kv line in the area the plan is to have at the onset 1 2mw of power which we intend to expand to 4mw in the near future we want to ensure that the heavy machines to be run at the facility have 24 hour electricity to work optimally essentially there will be no downtime if the occupiers wish in addition to provision of 24 7 the centre is fitted with factory space security and office space it will provide spaces for live in desks for relevant government agencies to engage support and provide services to the small businesses at the centre the agencies to be hosted at the centre according to the governor s aide are boi corporate affairs commission cac national agency for food and drug administration and control nafdac edo internal revenue service eirs among others these supports will make owners of memes more productive a representative of fabricators and welders to be hosted at the production centre in benin rev lugard ekhosuehi michael said the arrangements for working space and constant electricity supply will help them eliminate the major problem they are faced with the state government has provided space for us and promised 24 hours electricity supply as these are the problems we are faced with as welders and fabricators in the state michael said edo s economic transformation with the production centre in benin about to be open for business the state s economy stands to gain immensely with complete turn around in terms of quality of what will be produce at the centre mrs dare who heads governor obaseki s jobs creation and skills development agency edojobs said as we are looking forward to the commissioning of this project in the very near future we will see a complete transformation in terms of the quality of what we produce capacity to produce and the number of jobs created by this production centre according to the governor s aide the hub will boost his promise to create a minimum of 200 000 jobs before the end of his first four years in office as his administration planned to create more jobs from industries through providing opportunities for industrialisation driven through private sector participation mrs dare said the hub is also expected to affect the growth of local capacity and support the state government s skills acquisition programmes expected to create lasting impact and provide viable paths to prosperity for youths in the state with the centre in place skills acquisition will be delivered alongside entrepreneurship and business management start up acceleration digital marketing and branding programmes the obaseki led administration is also not relenting in formulating the necessary policies and programmes that would empower youths to fit into the emerging economy which his administration is creating obaseki said we want to create several job incubation centres hubs where job seekers will be trained and employed by the entrepreneurs in the state we have the potential to create all we want as we have the base materials so we have to prepare our youths to fit into these new jobs we intend to create via training the direct and indirect jobs to be created at the hub will contribute significantly to nigeria s manufacturing sector access to finance funding for msmes the production centre initiative pursued by the edo state government is quite grand and offers a wide range of benefits to local investors who are being strategically organised as a cluster to improve access to funding and other financial instruments during a visit to the hub the governor of central bank nigeria cbn mr godwin emefiele while lauding governor obaseki s initiative in setting up the production hub said the centre will enable financial institutions like the apex bank easily reach smes and assist them tackle the problem in accessing finance and other support with the cluster it becomes easy for the cbn and other financial institutions to meet with entrepreneurs who are doing business at the hub according to emefiele the creation of the hub is a timely intervention by the edo state government as the cbn is making plans to deal with issues affecting financing for smes according to him the cbn in collaboration with the bankers committee have set up the national micro finance bank to assist deposit money banks and smes access fund easily we have set up over 20 centers for the national micro finance bank nmfb across the country and i am sure edo state will have a share the apex bank governor said mrs dare explained that the state government is also collaborating with boi for funding as the obaseki led administration will leverage on the boi s expertise in industrialisation and production to attract funding for the msmes at the production centre small scale businesses who will operate their businesses at the benin cluster will now have easy access to funding with the opportunity to take loan as a cluster with the ease to access loan at about nine per cent interest rate and provision of constant electricity the production centre has provided solutions to challenges faced by smes which according to emefiele will enable owners of small scale businesses to cut cost of production even as they are better prepared to compete effectively and create employment for themselves and others while supporting the government to also grow the economy
what to know about 2 6 million vehicles were shipped from mexico to the u s in 2018 almost double the 1 33 million vehicles imported in 2011 mexico vehicle imports totaled more than 93 billion last year mexico vehicle imports last year totaled about 15 of the total of 17 30 million vehicles sold in the states last year honda s head of american operations henio arcangeli worries that president donald trump s latest proposal to slap a 5 tariff on auto imports from mexico will price some americans out of cars just when auto prices are near record highs the tariffs will be a problem for us and everyone else in the industry arcangeli said in an interview like many u s and foreign automakers honda imports much of its u s bound autos from its manufacturing plants in mexico it imported 109 989 of its fit and hr v models from mexico last year a more than 600 jump since 2011 according to mexico s instituto nacional de estadística y geografía or inegi the north american free trade agreement opened the borders between the u s mexico and canada in the early 1990s and paved the way for an international auto manufacturing industry between the three nations mexico is now one of the largest auto manufacturing countries in the world and autos and auto parts are the largest single export by value to the united states about 2 6 million vehicles were shipped north of the border in 2018 valued at more than 93 billion up from just 1 33 million vehicles in 2011 according to inegi data that s about 15 of the total of 17 30 million vehicles sold in the states last year trump s using the tariffs to pressure the mexican government to stem illegal immigration over the southern border he s threatened to levy tariffs at 5 come june 10 and will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied at which time the tariffs will be removed trump said in a tweet by october 1 barring a resolution the tariffs will jump to 25 which for some mexican made cars and light trucks could translate into more than 10 000 per vehicle he said here s what you have to remember tariff equals tax hike said paul ingrassia a pulitzer prize winning automotive journalist now working with the revs institute said on cnbc friday but even vehicles assembled in the u s including those bearing foreign brand names like toyota honda mercedes benz and hyundai would be hit by the tariffs if a resolution isn t found before they go into effect in less than two weeks american assembly plants make extensive use of a significant number of mexican made parts and components such as wiring harnesses that are low value or which have high labor content about 70 of the wiring harnesses used in the u s come from mexico those auto parts and components bring the total to 99 6 billion according to u s census bureau data even at 5 the added tariff potentially could scrub the deal especially for marginal buyers said joe phillippi head of autotrends consulting noting they could add about 1 500 to the cost of a typical mexican made ram 1500 or chevrolet silverado pickup that would jump fivefold if the tariffs aren t removed by october with some pickups and other mexican imports topping 50 000 apiece the tariffs could add on 10 000 or more or force manufacturers to swallow a large share of their profit margins the average transaction price what customers actually pay after factoring in options and incentives will reach a near record 33 457 for may lmc automotive forecast a 4 year over year increase the auto industry gets hammered if the tariffs are enacted with the situation getting worse each month as they are increased phillippi said it is possible that the auto industry may try to absorb some of the added costs as has been the case with some of the trump tariffs on imported aluminum and steel but that would have a harsh impact on an industry facing a weakening market sales were off by 2 8 during the first four months of this year and are expected to be down another 2 1 when may numbers are released next week according to a forecast by lmc automotive things get particularly complicated on the component side it has become commonplace since nafta went into effect in 1994 for parts to move back across what has become a largely invisible border some may cross from mexico to the u s and back again as often as seven times said steve kinkade a spokesman for honda the japanese automaker imported 107 989 vehicles from mexico in 2018 a 611 increase since 2011 its numbers pale when compared to general motors which led the industry by importing 666 765 vehicles from mexico last year a 109 6 increase since 2011 next in line was fiat chrysler automobiles at 504 793 vehicles a 206 2 increase during the same period according to inegi data a growing list of automakers now produce vehicles in mexico taking advantage of both cheap labor and that country s extensive array of free trade agreements fully a third of the vehicles nissan sold in the u s last year came from mexico while audi s new plant near puebla serves as the sole global source of its latest generation q5 sport utility vehicle arcangeli sidestepped direct criticism of the president s directive saying only that honda is very hopeful that a resolution will be found quickly allowing a return to business as usual most of the other automakers cnbc approached declined to directly comment referring instead to a statement by the trade group the alliance of automobile manufacturers our position on tariffs remains unchanged they are a tax on our customers which means they re harmful to our nation s economy and the millions of american jobs that depend on cross border trade said a statement attributed to interim president and ceo dave schwietert in a congress that has been polarized since the 2016 elections even some republicans took aim at the tariff plan on friday u s senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley of iowa said trade policy and border security are separate issues this is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent the president s announcement comes two weeks after he chose to delay by up to six months the possibility of enacting tariffs of up to 25 on european made autos and auto parts following a commerce department study that determined they pose a threat to national security chinese made autos and auto parts currently face tariffs due to the u s china trade dispute cnbc s emma newburger michelle fox phil lebeau and meghan reeder contributed to this article this story first appeared on cnbc com

the international air transport association iata announced a downgrade of its 2019 outlook for the global air transport industry to a 28 billion profit from 35 5 billion forecasts in december 2018 that is also a decline on 2018 net post tax profits which iata estimates at 30 billion re stated the business environment for airlines has deteriorated with rising fuel prices and a substantial weakening of world trade in 2019 overall costs are expected to grow by 7 4 outpacing a 6 5 rise in revenues as a result net margins are expected to be squeezed to 3 2 from 3 7 in 2018 profit per passenger will similarly decline to 6 12 from 6 85 in 2018 this year will be the tenth consecutive year in the black for the airline industry but margins are being squeezed by rising costs right across the board including labor fuel and infrastructure stiff competition among airlines keeps yields from rising weakening of global trade is likely to continue as the us china trade war intensifies this primarily impacts the cargo business but passenger traffic could also be impacted as tensions rise airlines will still turn a profit this year but there is no easy money to be made said alexandre de juniac iata s director general and ceo in 2019 the return on invested capital earned from airlines is expected to be 7 4 down from 7 9 in 2018 while this still exceeds the average cost of capital estimated at 7 3 the buffer is extremely thin moreover the job of spreading financial resilience throughout the industry is only half complete with a major gap in profitability between the performance of airlines in north america europe and asia pacific and the performance of those in africa latin america and the middle east the good news is that airlines have broken the boom and bust cycle a downturn in the trading environment no longer plunges the industry into a deep crisis but under current circumstances the great achievement of the industry creating value for investors with normal levels of profitability is at risk airlines will still create value for investors in 2019 with above cost of capital returns but only just said de juniac costs the high price of fuel from 2018 71 6 barrel brent will continue in 2019 with an average cost of 70 00 barrel brent expected this is 27 5 higher than the 54 9 barrel brent in 2017 fuel costs will account for 25 of operating costs up from 23 5 in 2018 non fuel unit costs are expected to rise to 39 5 cents per available tonne kilometer from 39 2 cents because of higher labor infrastructure and other costs overall expenses are expected to rise 7 4 to 822 billion revenues overall revenues are not keeping pace with the rise in costs for 2019 total revenues of 865 billion are expected 6 5 on 2018 cargo after an exceptional performance in 2017 9 7 growth cargo demand growth slowed to 3 4 in 2018 it is anticipated to be flat in 2019 with cargo volumes of 63 1 million tonnes 63 3 million tonnes in 2018 because of the impact of higher tariffs on trade cargo yields are expected to be flat in 2019 after a 12 3 improvement in 2018 as cargo load factors fall further and supply demand conditions weaken passenger passenger demand growth is expected to be more robust than for cargo this is because global gdp growth is expected to remain relatively strong at 2 7 albeit slower than in 2018 3 1 governments and central banks have responded to slower economic growth with more supportive policies which is providing an offset to trade weakness but economic growth and household incomes will still grow more slowly so total passenger demand measured in revenue passenger kilometers is expected to grow by 5 0 down from 7 4 in 2018 airlines have responded to the slower growth environment by trimming capacity expansion to 4 7 asks total passenger numbers are expected to rise to 4 6 billion up from 4 4 billion in 2018 passenger yields are expected to remain flat in 2019 after a 2 1 fall in 2018 cash flow free cash flow which enables investors to be paid and debt to be reduced is expected to disappear at the industry level because cash from operations will be reduced by slower demand growth and higher costs debt to earnings ratios which had fallen significantly are starting to rise once more average debt to earnings ratios for airlines in europe and north america are not far above the levels rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies which provides a degree of security in the event of a deterioration in the business environment africa middle east and latin america still have high levels of debt 6 7 times annual earnings which leaves them more vulnerable to cash flow shocks increasingly likely or rising interest rates risk factors downside risks are significant political instability and the potential for conflict never bodes well for air travel even more critical is the proliferation of protectionist measures and the escalation of trade wars as the us china trade war intensifies the immediate risks to an already beleaguered air cargo industry increase and while passenger traffic demand is holding up the impact of worsening trade relations could spillover and dampen demand aviation needs borders that are open to people and to trade nobody wins from trade wars protectionist policies or isolationist agendas but everybody benefits from growing connectivity a more inclusive globalization must be the way forward said de juniac regional roundup all regions are expecting a reduction in profitability with the exception of north america and latin america regional differences are significant north american carriers will deliver the strongest financial performance with a 15 billion post tax profit up from 14 5 billion in 2018 that represents a net profit of 14 77 per passenger which is a marked improvement from just 7 years earlier 2 3 in 2012 net margins forecast at 5 5 are down from 2018 levels owing to higher than expected fuel costs and slowing growth the limited downside in this region has been underpinned by consolidation helping to sustain load factors passenger cargo above 65 and ancillaries which limit the impact of higher fuel costs keeping breakeven load factors to 59 5 european airlines will deliver a net profit of 8 1 billion down from 9 4 billion in 2018 that represents a net profit per passenger of 6 75 and a net margin of 3 7 both are the second strongest industry results but below what north american carriers earn breakeven load factors are the highest at 70 2 caused by low yields due to the highly competitive open aviation area high regulatory costs and inefficient infrastructure in 2019 for example en route air traffic management delays doubled to 19 1 million minutes europe also is one of the more exposed regions to weak international trade and this has damaged prospects this year asia pacific airlines will deliver a net profit of 6 0 billion down from 7 7 billion in 2018 that represents a net profit per passenger of 3 51 and a net margin of 2 3 the region is showing very diverse performance accounting for about 40 of global air cargo traffic makes the region the most exposed to weakness in world trade and that combined with higher fuel costs is squeezing the regions profits middle eastern airlines will deliver a combined net loss of 1 1 billion slightly worse than the 1 0 billion loss in 2018 that equates to a 5 01 loss per passenger and a negative net margin 1 9 the region has faced substantial challenges in recent years both to the business environment and to business models airlines there are going through a process of adjustment and announced schedules point to a substantial slowdown in capacity growth in 2019 performance is now improving but the worsening in the business environment is expected to prolong losses in 2019 latin american airlines will deliver a net profit of 0 2 billion this reflects a moderate improvement from the 0 5 billion loss in 2018 as the recovery of the brazilian economy is offsetting higher oil prices with a 0 50 profit per passenger the region s net margin is expected to be a thin 0 4 african airlines will deliver a 0 1 billion loss unchanged from 2018 continuing a weak trend into its fourth year each passenger carried is expected to cost the carriers 1 54 leading to a 1 0 net margin breakeven load factors are relatively low as yields are a little higher than average and costs are lower however few airlines in the region are able to achieve adequate load factors which averaged the lowest globally at 60 7 in 2018 overall

our south african investor client base is one of the most active on the continent outside of south africa egypt has one of the most liquid markets bringing egyptian corporates to meet south african clients given the latter s interest in investing in a liquid market like egypt is the most important reason for us to hold the north africa investor conference emerging markets em have been confronted by several near term challenges resulting in valuations that were approaching crisis levels by november 2018 to better understand how em will perform in 2019 and to unearth the prospects of african capital markets daily news egypt interviewed ruslan babaev and anna vyshlova co chief executive officers of renaissance capital what is the importance of this year s conference taking into consideration south africa s reforms including pensions and investments babaev this is the fourth year in a row that we have held our north africa investor conference here in cape town the biggest reason besides the reforms is the south african client base which is one of the continent s most active outside of south africa egypt has one of the most liquid markets in africa ahead of kenya and nigeria egypt trades between 40mn and 60mn a day while the other two markets trade on average between 10mn and 20mn only considering this from an investment point of view you would always want to be invested in a liquid market if you look at the activity on the banking side it is very important to bring egyptian corporates to meet the investor client base in cape town given their interest in opportunities in north africa in the wake of the 2018 em crisis and fed interest rate hikes how do you view 2019 for em babaev in trading all the markets are interconnected last year wasn t rough for emerging markets only the s p fell almost 20 peak to trough however the beginning of 2019 has overall been more positive dollar strength has been more muted the fed and ecb have become more dovish generally which has supported em currencies if you look at tech names they are up by 30 100 in europe and the us therefore the global market backdrop has been positive so far obviously china has been implementing stimulus measures which is helping to create more positive momentum for example the amount of deals coming from em on the debt capital markets dcm side has increased compared to last year when there was no single initial public offering ipo or secondary public offering spo in nigeria or russia this year we have already seen a number of spos and dcm mandates and the ipo season in the us and europe has kick started there are always risks and we go through ups and downs especially in em but it is difficult to generalise as each em country has its specific story so in your opinion which em is set to outperform this year babaev egypt has been performing strongly this year russia as well but if you look specifically at egypt its performance is dependent on reforms a recovery of the economy interest rate cuts and expectations for industrialisation and the consumer market given egypt s large population with russia for example investors like the economic orthodoxy and low valuations but are monitoring the risk of further sanctions and for turkey economic policies are causing some concern which have clearly not been positive for investor sentiment south africa has just gone through elections as well as nigeria and some investors are taking a wait and see attitude until the new cabinets are formed in both countries egypt is quite well positioned as long as it can maintain momentum continue reforms get companies into the market and continue privatisation how do you view the egyptian economy following reforms what does egypt need to attract more fdi vyshlova i think that egypt is probably the best reform story coming out of em this is driven by the fact that the government made very bold economic reforms and did not just address short term issues with short term solutions it addressed structural issues with long term fixes such as subsidy reform examining the key economic indicators in terms of gdp growth unemployment deficits and foreign investor appetite improvements are visible across the board in terms of fdi we need to distinguish between fdi into the oil and gas sector which historically has been strong and other fdi in oil and gas fdi has been strong recently while other sectors are likely to gradually improve can you rank em from your perspective vyshlova in frontier markets we are overweight on vietnam kazakhstan georgia and egypt the top performing em countries so far this year are egypt russia saudi arabia china colombia and south africa the recent move upwards in oil prices is positive for russia for south africa we are cautiously optimistic on the equity market for 2019 and the new cabinet is the next event to monitor post election as a firm we are 100 focused on frontier and emerging markets which have always formed the core of our company s dna these are fast moving markets and the most important thing here is to seize opportunities once they emerge it is more about diversification rather than ranking does renaissance capital plan to enter new markets in 2019 babaev we are always opportunistic so we never say categorically that we are not going to enter any market but it needs to make sense and fit our core strategy currently we are not looking at any particular new market vyshlova we have sufficient resources and expertise to quickly decide whether to have a local presence if we see an opportunity we are focusing on where we can add value and where we have an edge how do you view the egyptian market and what are your company s plans there vyshlova egypt is obviously a very important market for us and we are committed to the success of our egyptian franchise on a long term basis which is why we have established an on the ground presence we have already strengthened our egyptian team with amr helal ceo of renaissance capital in north africa we have ahmed hafez leading our local research among our most recent hires are nancy fahmy financial services research analyst and omar gaafar vice president investment banking we are very excited about our prospects in the egyptian market we already have several active mandates on the ecm side and in mergers and acquisitions m a as a firm we have the best of both worlds we offer the international expertise and the local perspective and insight so we believe that we can add a great value to our clients as one of the few frontier focused investment banks in light of the us april job reports do you think the fed will maintain or even cut interest rates babaev one needs to consider more numbers than the job reports historically it has been hard to predict the fed s next interest rate move due to the impact of global economic factors if you look at the global economy it has been weakening so people expect interest rates to go lower in line with most of europe where zero percent interest rates prevail relative to european interest rates the us rates seem quite high but again the us economy has been booming i believe it is premature to debate whether the fed will start lowering interest rates currently it appears that the fed will not implement any more hikes this year and if it does not it would be supportive for em particularly if the us and china are able to agree on trade what history has taught us is that even if interest rates are trending higher or lower that does not mean that em will necessarily go one way or the other in 2004 2007 we saw spectacular returns for em equities during a time when the us raised rates from 1 to 5 25 so it s more about the pace of rate moves and the underlying economic backdrop look at turkey for example it does not matter what happens with interest rates as this wouldn t help the economy for other reasons what is renaissance capital s target market share in egypt and other african markets in the next five years babaev it differs from country to country in kenya we are currently the number one broker in nigeria we are the number two broker as of fy18 and in egypt we maintain leading positions with our international institutional clients in these markets we aim to always maintain a top three position while in other markets we focus on adding value first and foremost do you plan to launch brokerage activities in the egyptian market vyshlova we trade out of london as well as via local brokerage partners which is enough for now but we can always change this approach at any time depending on markets clients and progress our on the ground team in egypt is now mainly focused on investment banking services how do you assess competition within the egyptian market vyshlova there are a number of local home grown players in the market who have been there for 20 30 years in our view they will continue to have market leading positions however renaissance capital also has a lot of value to add we are an international frontier focused investment bank with a unique role to play in the market in some cases we can be complementary to some of the local players in other cases it is inevitable that we will be competing with them but i believe there are abundant business opportunities for everyone in the market
the becket fund is a non profit law firm focused on the protection of religious liberty its reach is global at the fund s annual dinner last week in new york u s senate chaplain dr barry c black was given becket s highest honor the canterbury medal black s speech upon receiving the award was uplifting frequently laugh inducing and very insightful black grew up in baltimore with his three brothers and sisters his mother worked various jobs to keep the family afloat financially and while her time was limited she made sure that her kids learned scripture so much did the learning matter to her that she rewarded her kids financially each time they recited scripture from memory black recalled to quite a bit of laughter that his mother ultimately had to amend how she compensated him after he proved particularly skilled when it came to memorization in black s case he wanted to earn more money because young person that he was he craved candy candy bars cost 5 cents each in the 1950s imagine that fast forward to the present and one nestle crunch bar on amazon lists for 2 48 though boxes of 36 can be purchased for a little under 33 imagine that candy bars haven t much changed but their costs surely have the dollar doesn t buy as much as it used to what used to purchase 20 candy bars will generally only purchase one at any retail establishment and then as previously mentioned 36 can be had for less than a dollar per if purchased in bulk on amazon black probably didn t plan it this way but the inspiring story he told about his childhood included a very useful lesson about inflation looked at through black s life inflation is theft it s the process whereby the agreement about value that is money the dollar in our case is gradually devalued such that it commands less and less in the marketplace this is worth thinking about a lot most of us work for dollars but it s not the dollars we want we want what those dollars can be exchanged for the clothing shelter food entertainment and candy among other things that we can get in return for our dollars we produce for dollars but we re really producing to fulfill our many needs and wants not to mention the needs and wants of those closest to us currency devaluation is a cruel tax on our work unfortunately economists and politicians don t agree captive to the wholly fallacious belief that devalued money renders what we produce more competitive in global markets economists and the politicians who blindly follow them relentlessly make an easy to discredit case for devaluing the money we earn they say the dollar must lose value over time so that u s businesses can compete globally every american suffers their economic illiteracy missed by ph ds and politicians is that nearly everything produced in the world today is a consequence of global cooperation translated imported inputs very much factor into american products and services which means the devalued dollar in no way cheapens what we sell when it s remembered that devaluation logically coincides with increased production costs worse the currency devaluation that excites academics and politicians ignores that what renders u s companies most competitive from a pricing standpoint is relentless investment in production enhancements that enable the creation of more and more with fewer and fewer hands the problem here is that devaluation exists as a tax on investment when it s remembered that investors when they put money to work are buying future dollar income streams devaluation reduces the value of those income streams which makes the investment necessary to achieve lower production costs much less likely and then it can t be forgotten that per chaplain black s childhood experiences americans earn dollars americans set out to earn those dollars with getting things in return for those dollars top of mind never explained by politicians and economists is how an economy that is comprised of individuals can be improved when those same individuals see the money they work for shrinking in terms of exchangeable value they have no answer instead they dissemble their claim is that a gradual erosion in the value of the dollar top economists routinely call for 2 annual inflation does wonders for economic growth since the fear of devaluation causes people to consume you see economists in their infinite wisdom comically believe that consumption powers economic growth in truth consumption is an effect of economic growth it s production that powers economic progress which means savings power growth for those savings morphing into the investment that routinely increases our productivity crucial here is that currency devaluation is anti saving precisely because those who delay consumption of goods and services until a later date see the exchangeable value of their money decline in short the inflationary bias of economists and members of the political class runs counter to economic growth for the devaluation encouraging consumption at the expense of savings it s kind of sad yet economists and political types are clueless as to why it s sad and they re slow learners indeed despite the long and very global correlation between currency devaluation and slow growth if any politicians and ph ds continue to promote it they can t be helped or they can t learn since they can t it may be best for us to dumb down the economic lesson barry black has one for them his nickels used to buy candy bars now they aren t even exchangeable for a piece of candy black s story very clearly reveals the horrors of inflation whereby the dollars we get in return for our work buy fewer and fewer things over time can politicians and economists please explain to us how the devaluation they champion but that robs the blacks of the world is a good thing

the government is preparing to throw billions into urbanization in china but has it thought through the hardware challenges perhaps the most striking way to take in china s startling urbanization is to sit in front of a computer and click through to google s earth engine a search for shanghai on the website brings up time lapsed images of the city from orbit in 1984 when the series began shanghai was a grey smudge in the middle of verdant countryside alongside a brown streak the yangtze river press play and that smudge spreads like an ink stain with downtown shanghai becoming darker and the etched lines of pudong international airport easily visible by 2012 the grey patchwork has sprawled out in every direction to leave just fragments of greenery by 2015 shanghai will reportedly host the second tallest building in the world with construction of the steel titan continuing at a feverish pace in the city s financial district shanghai s mushrooming growth is part of the largest urbanization story in human history the process is transforming china and in some ways has only just begun by 2030 china s cities will be home to roughly one billion people three times the current population of the us when china began its reform and opening processes in the late 1970s the country was an overwhelmingly rural one back then with more than 80 living in the countryside it was the backwaters that supplied most of china s leaders who sprung from peasant backgrounds since then china has been transformed from the 1970s up until the end of 2011 when half of china s population lived in cities around 500 million people have added to china s urban population in the last three years and the process continues to happen at a terrific rate beijing regards urbanization as the next step in sustaining china s economic miracle the push from farm to city will serve as the biggest lever for the country s economic growth helping to modernize and transform the country from an investment driven economy to one that is consumer driven according to top government leaders and independent economists china s urbanization drive to date has wrought severe social and environmental problems though and a new approach is needed industries that are key to the process such as construction have thus far tooled themselves to deliver quantity over quality raising the question can china actually build the new china the master plan answering this fundamental question in the affirmative beijing mapped out the next phase of that shift from countryside to city in march of this year china s long awaited urbanization plan running from this year through to 2020 is not lacking in ambition or superlatives the eye catching headline is that the government aims to raise the rate of urbanization in the world s most populated country by roughly a percentage point every year from 52 5 at present to approximately 60 inside seven years the bolder portion of the plan will confer former rural residents who are currently living in cities the same benefits and rights that urban dwellers enjoy by granting urban residency permits which are china s internal passports and better known as hukou this move could transform the lives of up to 160 million migrants as it will enable them to access basic services and social welfare in doing so authorities anticipate the hukou urbanization rate will surge from just over 35 in 2012 to 45 in 2020 a faster increase than the previous decade to cater to this huge influx of up to 260 million people planning officials have envisaged 21 mega regions nationwide to harbor the urban population the previous phases of the urban operating model had emphasized the hardware of city building roads railways airports and so on this approach led local officials to fixate on the size of the city as this sets the boundaries on urban versus rural population without thoughtful consideration and planning to ensure effective land usage senior officials discussing urbanization in the past typically took it as carte blanche for another round of infrastructure spending more steel more cement more building more money and more investment says qinwei wang chief china economist for capital economics in london that fixation came at the expense of soft infrastructure services to assist the urbanizing population such as schools and hospitals that is set to change under the plan planning authorities this time have vowed to focus on the people populating those urban areas for the next phase otherwise known as a new type of urbanization what is new urbanization how does it differ to china s last periods of urbanization where they brought 500 million citizens from countryside to cities i think that had been an era of focus on hardware transport infrastructure getting roads buildings bridges and so on correctly invested into and now it shifts toward how to put more livability around china s urbanization says david frey partner at kpmg s global china practice and country head of the consultancy s cities global center of excellence china would fail in its urbanization if it simply displaced people from rural to urban says frey recognizing such beijing intends to build more extensive urban public transport systems especially in large cities and a national rail and road network to connect smaller cities and townships it also aims to increase water and waste treatment ratios particularly outside of large cities while expanding broadband internet coverage increasing the use of cleaner burning natural gas in place of dirty coal in cities and more district heating in the north to replace household coal fired boilers a people centric urbanization in china also means theoretically greater spending on social welfare hopefully to boost consumption of services bottom up top down the plan sticks with china s model of top down oversight that encouraged bottom up migration migrants moved of their own accord seeking a better life in cities that were in desperate need of workers as they modernized similar to how urbanization proceeded elsewhere there had been a huge impediment to the flow of people from the countryside into cities due to the restrictive hukou system and until deng xiaoping came onto the scene there were tight restrictions on labor mobility at the same time the role of the state runs deep in urbanization in contrast with how the process has been largely organic elsewhere the country s rapid phase of urbanization especially in the last 20 years has been driven by strong government initiative at the central and local levels in other places urbanization just happens says frey it s an economic phenomenon that is a result not a plan city governments welcomed the influx of workers as they had decided the maintenance of economic growth in their administrations hinged on rapid urbanization in other words a building binge on infrastructure china s command over the urbanization process stands in stark comparison with the efforts of the world s second largest emerging economy as recently as 1987 india was more urban than china as a quarter of the population lived in cities compared with china s 24 according to data from the world bank but china s pace of urbanization overtook india s toward the end of the 1990s and raced ahead more than half of chinese citizens were urbanized in 2012 compared with less than a third in india experts with mckinsey have attributed the overtaking to beijing s carefully shaped approach to urban transformation while new delhi has been less hands on if you were to check with urban planners in any economy today they would tell you that in fact the best urbanization the most optimized urbanization actually does occur with more planning says frey planning that involves much weighing of what to mimic and what not to mimic in other nations urbanization models in china when it s foreign expertise they need the most they re not afraid to rush up and get in says kent zaitlik business development director of sustainable sourcing and solutions company bee in shanghai that s at the helm of what makes china so great that they re able to incorporate various learnings from around the world and then incorporate those insights and techniques into whatever strategy they want to achieve the top down approach has arguably been vindicated in the relative absence of illegal slums and informal settlements in urban china unlike other countries that have recently undergone some form of urbanization such as india brazil and mexico china does not want the type of urbanization like in latin america where people moved to urban areas with no jobs and became unemployed and a burden to society says wang from capital economics although china s urbanization has been impressive it has impressed because of the unprecedented geographical scale on which it is occurring not everything has gone according to plan and evidence of china s unbalanced urbanization has manifested in other ways the flaws in the previous model in which urban construction mostly relied on land sales and fiscal revenue have emerged in recent years and the model is unsustainable warned finance vice minister wang bao an on the unveiling of the new plan in mid march spatial urbanization has happened at a much faster pace than the rate of urban population growth which since the late 1970s has been slower than other countries encouraged by local governments that seized rural land and sold it to developers to build residential properties office buildings and industrial parks consequently increase in urban land under construction expanded quicker than urban growth at around 90 versus 52 from 1990 2000 and 83 over 45 in the next decade according to data from the ministry of housing and rural development mohurd between 2000 and 2010 the ratio of urbanization of land to urbanization of population was 1 85 far above the international standard of 1 12 and leading to urban sprawl and the phenomenon of ghost towns building a new china china s new style of urbanization envisages half of the new buildings put up by the year 2020 to be green compared with just 2 in 2012 it also takes aim at the hot button issue of chronic smog hanging over chinese cities calling for more than 60 of cities to have air quality that meets national standards particulate matter 2 5 rating between 35 and 75 depending on the location by 2020 whereas environmental official announced in march that only three of 74 surveyed cities that met with national standards the sweeping scale of that mandate evokes skepticism regarding china s technical capacity to actually carry it out my main concern is with their engineering capacity with being able to implement some of the things they want to implement says zaitlik from bee i don t think they really have a firm grasp of some of the engineering feats that need to be taken into account to incorporate some of the green technologies they want to use for instance zaitlik pointed to heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac design as a particular challenge design of a hvac system is what s most important to green building development says zaitlik as it determines energy efficiency indoor air quality and comfort the multinational firms that bee works with typically have the skill set to design sophisticated hvac systems but for chinese firms it s a different story because their engineering team probably does not have the capability to incorporate some of those technologies fromabroad he says that is a different kind of thinking that china will almost need a crash course in that s what s difficult frey from kpmg concurs that s not something you just flip a switch on he says what frey expects to happen is progressive and talented individuals seizing the initiative in certain cities with their efforts eventually gaining traction and then replicated across the country over time he also points out that developed economies in their own transformational programs have also struggled with fostering green development no country no area no region really has a lock on what that path is what china has shown is that when it sets its mind to something it s pretty good at figuring out how to execute but the industry is plagued with short termism and is beholden to maximizing profits and lowering building costs with little consideration for the building s lifecycle the environment or the health of the occupants they ve been building like this for years and it s all about having results about who brings up the building wins says zaitlik he adds that one of the key reasons why the entire lifecycle of a building is not given proper attention in china is because developers run the show developers don t really care about the whole life of the building they just want to get in and get out as soon as possible there re no rules or regulations or incentives for them really to actually try to go forth and make sure that this building is energy efficient part of the solution may lie in china s green building certification the green building design label also known as three star pushed out by the ministry of construction in 2006 it is similar but newer than its western counterpart leadership in energy and environmental design leed and consists of a set of evaluation standards for rating green building sustainability mohurd doles out financial subsidies under the scheme on a per square meter basis with up to rmb 250 available zaitlik says that if adhered to it could grow green constructions quickly but clearly defining green is crucial if they don t really solidify what the meaning of green is and also have a rigorous process in place to actually show the efficacy of what they re developing then it will be a lot of lost money and not much to gain further down the road frey argues that developers will ultimately have to act out of sheer necessity noting some developers are already awarded projects based on their ability to differentiate with a set of eco standards some of china s largest developers are already well down this path snapping up eco conscious expertise and knowhow as they look toward the future according to frey smaller developers are also getting involved by tapping consultancies and institutions like the china greentech initiative a collaboration of greentech firms government agencies and non profit organizations that promote greentech solutions the environmental brinks in addition to the negative environmental impact of urbanization social problems in addition are nothing to sneer at the majority of urban population additions have contributed little to increased spending and consumption growth migrants will typically save their money to compensate for the lack of access to social benefits rendering them not much better off than when living in the countryside in some cases from these complications arise vexing questions is urbanization really the answer or are there alternative options for elevating the quality of life for rural populations views are split most certainly says rena singer from the seattle based landesa rural development institute when asked if an economy can be considered developed and rural developed refers to standard of living not place of living she says conversely frey says a high rural population would indicate underlying problems with agricultural development wang concurs surmising that if the countryside is working as it should that will simply free people up to move to cities productivity is relatively low when you consider many people are still in rural areas says wang from capital economics there s still a lot of room for china to improve in the agriculture sector which means china does not need so many people to stay in rural zones to work in the agriculture industry the new plan looks to address agricultural productivity through a number of measures such as mechanization and the transfer of land user rights from small farmers to specialized farms rural cooperatives and agricultural firms leading to larger farm plots that are more efficient wang says a common scenario in the future might be one farmer on a combined larger plot of farmland making a better living and employing workers versus 10 farmers each farming less than half an acre of land and living in poverty with the other nine farmers sufficiently compensated intensive farming has already taken shape in pig farming the jiahua pig breeding farm in zhejiang province can produce 100 000 animals every year in the future there will be more of these kinds of big farms it will be more modern and better managed says wang whether rural can be equated with developed or not china s government is decidedly uninterested in the question for china it s cities all that way but as frey notes that can only happen if agriculture productivity is rising not one drop china is already a water stressed nation a problem that expanding urbanization will presumably exacerbate a study by china s ministry of water resources found that approximately 55 of china s 50 000 rivers that existed in the 1990s have disappeared furthermore the state forestry administration released figures this year indicating that china had lost 340 000 square kilometers of wetlands that s roughly the size of the netherlands unfortunately china has only just started to address its water problems implementing progressive pricing on water in larger cities which won t derail massive water shortages by a long shot the key to avoiding that wang says will be smoothing out the migratory patterns urbanization has typically favored the wealthier provinces on the eastern seaboard and southern coast which has in turn increased resource pressures in those parts in the plan it looks like the government has realized this problem and they want to develop the smaller second or third tier cities in broader areas not only in the coastal areas but in central or west of china so that will ease tension a little bit in a break with the past the future pattern of urbanization will likely be slow and measured i think china will make a lot of mistakes i also think it will also get a lot of things right says frey from a more grassroots perspective there is a raft of exciting new smart city technologies the internet of things smart grids and meters and even driverless cars that are coming to bear lending a technological element that has largely been absent from china s urbanization story shanghai s iconic bund skyline was deemed a space age pipe dream when it was first conceived and is now arguably the symbol of new china so while many aspects of the new urbanization plan seem overly lofty china may prove again that it does what it sets out to do by any means necessary

and state employees shifting billions of dollars in costs plus interest onto taxpayers after 2032 the new budget would close projected deficits totaling more than 3 billion over the next two fiscal years combined it also would establish the largest budget reserve in state history a 2 billion cushion against the next recession we have a very different legislature than we had two years ago we have a new governor and we had to balance a lot of concerns rep jason rojas d east hartford said of a revenue package that involved lots of compromise keeping income tax rates flat rep jason rojas d east hartford credit claude albert ctmirror org one of those concerns came from the governor after raising state income tax rates in 2009 2011 and 2015 connecticut s economy could not absorb another increase in its largest tax to avert the latest budget deficit forecast he said but while lamont and some of the new democratic lawmakers from fairfield county strongly opposed any increase in income tax rates including those aimed only at wealthy households a growing progressive element within the party pressed hard for the rich to pay more there s never been better public support for a capital gains surcharge on the wealthy said rep anne hughes d easton co chairwoman of the house democratic progressive caucus there s never been a better appetite to actually use capital gains revenue to pay down some of the debt liability or fully fund education that s something we have to respect rojas said they re here they re active they re vocal and the debate isn t over well it s over for the next three days but rojas point was that the discussion would continue in sessions to come hughes agreed leadership is totally owning that she said are we disappointed absolutely one of the key reasons for that debate involves tens of billions of dollars of unfunded pension liabilities connecticut amassed over a 70 year period surging pension and other debt costs coupled with an economy that recovered slowly after the last recession have left the state budget plagued with deficit forecasts even though income tax receipts have been sharply rising over the past year analysts warned state finances needed to be adjusted when lamont proposed his budget in february the estimate was that state finances would run 3 7 billion in deficit over the next two years combined unless changes were made the new governor said the income tax which was increased in 2009 2011 and 2015 should not be the tool to close the gap yet another time asking consumers to pay more rep anne hughes d easton co chairwoman of the house democratic progressive caucus file photo but legislators balked at some of lamont s alternatives a tax of 1 5 cents per ounce on sugary beverages was scrapped amid strong opposition from urban lawmakers the governor s plan to eliminate dozens of sales tax exemptions was also scaled back considerably one of the key proposals that survived though eliminates the special 1 percent rate on digital downloads replacing it with the standard rate of 6 35 percent the new budget includes a finance committee proposal for a one percent sales tax surcharge on restaurant meals and other prepared foods the 66 million it would raise originally was earmarked for cities and towns but instead it will remain in the state s coffers lamont had recommended a tax on all e cigarette products including vaping pens and liquid cartridges equal to 75 percent of the wholesale price the budget instead includes a lesser tax but only on cartridges and only those that contain nicotine but some healthcare advocates have questioned how effective this approach would be a 2014 study conducted by the salt lake county health department in utah found 61 percent of e liquids collected from local vaping shops had nicotine contents that varied by at least 10 percent from the content posted on the label other consumer related revenue components of the new budget include a new fee of 10 cents on plastic bags and a 10 percent increase in the alcoholic beverages excise tax opioid tax is out hospital tax is a question mark a new opioid tax of one cent per milligram had been included in the package but was stripped out sunday the tax would have been imposed not at the retail level but at the first point of sale in the state in connecticut this most commonly involves distributors selling to health care providers that s because most of the opioids used in connecticut are manufactured out of state it was expected to raise about 20 million per year critics of the tax said it would be passed onto insurance companies and ultimately to patients on paper the new budget will ask legislators to maintain the current provider tax connecticut levies on its hospitals but there s a chance that levy could change later this summer lamont announced a tentative agreement last week to settle a lawsuit hospitals filed four years ago over the provider tax the new budget also is expected to resolve a 200 million plus dispute involving state payments to hospitals since last october for treatment of medicaid patients lamont administration budget director melissa mccaw credit ryan caron king connecticut public radio office of policy and management secretary melissa mccaw lamont s budget director said legislators likely would be asked to return in special session this summer after hospitals have ratified the settlement to make adjustments to the provider tax and to supplemental state payments to the industry this could cost the state an estimated 160 million which would be taken from this year s projected surplus but house majority leader matt ritter d hartford said it is a reasonable price to pay to settle a lawsuit that might have cost the state billions of dollars had it lost in court taxing small businesses and mansion sales business groups objected to another tax hike in the budget designed to raise 50 million annually from so called pass through entities limited liability corporations and other businesses that don t pay the state corporation tax instead the business earnings pass through to the owners who then pay personal income taxes on them and while the wealthy won t face an income tax increase they will face what s being called a mansion tax it s a special surcharge on the real estate conveyance tax aimed only at the sale of high priced homes by people who in turn leave the state rep gail lavielle r wilton minority republican legislators who are expected to unanimously oppose the budget because of the array of tax hikes have not offered an alternative budget but rep gail lavielle of wilton ranking gop representative on the appropriations committee said democrats have not done everything possible to trim costs we re seeing an absolute strategy of putting ideological goals and special interests ahead of the best interests of the state she said as evidence lavielle noted the legislature has approved nearly a dozen new union contracts that award raises in the next two fiscal years despite the deficit forecasts and while democrats are touting recent enactment of a bill to gradually raise the minimum wage from 10 10 to 15 per hour little thought was put into how this might drive up costs in the next budget lavielle noted the package includes rate increases for nursing homes some of which have unionized workers that are threatening to strike both nursing home management and union members have said the minimum wage increase could put more pressure on the industry to raise pay to retain workers private nonprofit social service agencies which provide the majority of state sponsored programs have raised a similar concern they asked for a special 100 million appropriation from the current surplus to retain staff and make other investments in their businesses that funding was not included in the budget investing in key priorities but democratic legislators said that despite the projected deficit they and the governor did manage to bolster funding for several key priorities rep toni walker d new haven credit jacqueline rabe thomas ct mirror the budget increases education cost sharing aid to cities and towns by 37 6 million in the first year of the new budget and by 78 million in the second municipalities also were spared a controversial bill lamont wanted them to pay 73 million into the state over the next two years combined to help offset rising teacher pension costs the tentative budget deal also would modestly increase the state s husky a medicaid program for working poor adults with children income eligibility limits would rise from 155 percent of the federal poverty level to 160 percent this would allow about 4 000 more residents to receive health care rep toni walker d new haven longtime co chairwoman of the appropriations committee said this budget begins to reverse the damage done to education health care job training and social services as connecticut struggled for years after the last recession with budget deficits and a slow recovery we have to make sure we spend more on education than incarceration walker said we have to make sure we spend more on developing jobs and our neighborhoods instead of crying that everybody is moving out of connecticut it s important that we recognize we have 3 5 million people in this state with a variety of needs
the russian media outlet gazeta ru published an article titled victim of war china and the united states will bring down russia the article argued that russian economy will suffer because of the trade war between china and the us below is gazeta ru s article the trade war between the us and china can reduce the price of russian resources the trade war between china and the united states will adversely impact russia the ministry of finance fears that russian energy resources will decline in price the ruble has already begun to fall due to the intensified confrontation between beijing and washington analysts warn that due to the fall in demand from china exporters of coal mineral ore agricultural commodities and other resources will suffer the trade war between the us and china can reduce the price of russian resources the russian minister of economic development maxim oreshkin told reporters it is clear that this whole story will have a negative impact on the demand for russian products this also applies to raw materials consequently such a scenario will mean a decline in prices for key resources oil mineral ore coal and whatever is exported from russia the minister said quoted by tass according to the head of the ministry of economy the trade confrontation between china and the united states will have a negative impact on non raw material exports from russia due to the weakening of global demand the slowdown in demand from china will hit a number of the larger russian companies exporting raw materials to china believes junior analyst of ic freedom finance alexandra ovchinnikova china is one of the largest consumers of raw materials oil coal non ferrous metals russia in turn has been the main supplier of oil to china for the last three years in addition impressive quantities of coal nickel copper and gold are being supplied to china ovchinnikova said the weakening of chinese demand under the pressure of the trade conflict will negatively affect the export positions of the russian federation among which a significant share is accounted for agricultural products forestry products of other processing industries declared the chief analyst of bks premier anton pocovovich at the same time the new round of the trade war between the us and china has already hit the russian currency the dollar has already appreciate on average to 65 rubles the further eruption of a trade war will in any case will put continued pressure on the ruble asserts anton pocovovich russian exports may suffer against the backdrop of a general recession earlier it became known that china from june the 1st in response to the us initiatives will introduce customs duties on us goods totaling 60 billion the duty on 2 493 goods including american liquefied natural gas lng which will be increased by 25 this measure was a response to the increase in duties from 10 to 25 on chinese goods imported into the u s u s president donald trump decided to raise tariffs after beijing and washington failed to conclude a final trade agreement last week china on may the 8th announced that it would follow with an adequate response whereas the us president was confident that beijing would not retaliate according to trump the trade tariffs imposed on china will not harm the american economy whereas china should prepare itself for the worst due to the fact that international companies will withdraw their production from chinese territory since after the introduction of the new duties many companies that were hit by the new tariffs will leave china for vietnam and other countries in asia in july the us imposed a duty of 25 on the import of 818 goods from china with a total delivery value of 34 billion a year china responded in kind then in september washington imposed customs duties for the amount of 10 on goods imported from china for a total value estimated at 200 billion china responded with duties from 5 to 10 on goods worth 60 billion after that the us president agreed not to increase import duties on chinese by 25 for goods worth 200 billion from january until a deal would be reached however this did not happen losses are borne by both parties and by the entire world economy exports of goods from the united states to china during this period fell by more than 30 anton pokatovich is convinced that if the trade conflict with china will develop along the most pessimistic scenario it will have a significant negative impact on the entire world economy the confrontation between the two major powers and as a consequence the deceleration of the chinese economy threatens to slow the growth of global demand for all major resources and russian exports may suffer against the backdrop of a general recession the constant exacerbation of international sanctions against our country is also playing its share some analysts predict that this year the rate of exchange of the dollar will go to 70 rubles in case that oil prices will fall or if the us again will raise the issue of imposing sanctions against russia a trade war will negatively affect the prices of a wide range of assets in the commodity markets says the chief analyst of the department of analytics and strategic marketing of promsvyazbank bogdan zvarich investors will revise the forecast for consumer goods downwards and thus they will reassess raw materials assets in the direction of a price downturn as for the possibility of reaching a trade agreement before june the 1st according to experts such a likelihood is very small most likely the negotiation process will drag on and will be accompanied by the further introduction of tariffs by both the us and china zvarich believes
further escalation of the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies china and the us could greatly hurt the global economy according to former governor of the people s bank of china pboc dai xianglong talking at a press event in beijing on friday he said that the consequence of the china us trade war not only will be reflected in both countries but will also extend to relevant regions extend to the whole world if the china us trade war continues to grow larger it may cause the global economy to decline and may cause a global financial crisis he said as cited by cnbc also on rt com china s nuclear option of dumping us bonds would cause absolute chaos in global markets expert dai who was pboc governor from 1995 to 2002 said he expects the china shanghai composite stock market index to rise steadily above the 3 000 level helped by china s coming market reforms the index which hit above the key psychological level of 3 000 earlier this year was trading at 2 898 on friday dai also attributed the recent weakness in the chinese yuan to the market s reaction to trade tensions he noted that beijing would not devalue the renminbi in response according to him fundamentals such as economic growth and foreign exchange reserves support a stable yuan read more china fighting people s war against us state media on tariff hikes former chinese vice commerce minister wei jianguo who was moderating the friday press event said that initiating a trade war with china might be the biggest strategic mistake made by the united states since world war ii or even its founding it can be said that the us this time has at the wrong time fought a wrong war and chosen a wrong opponent wei said adding that trade tensions could last 30 years or more also on rt com what are rare earth metals why they are china s nuclear option in trade war with us i m confident that time reason and truth are on our side he said our chinese people will most certainly win peace will most certainly win china and the us are deadlocked over an almost year long trade war which worsened when earlier this month the trump administration accused beijing of reneging on commitments to make structural changes to its economic practices washington slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 percent on 200 billion worth of chinese goods which prompted beijing to hit back with additional levies on the majority of us imports on a 60 billion target list china s retaliatory tariffs are set to take effect on june 1 for more stories on economy finance visit rt s business section
australia s renewable energy target reads like a national suicide note but the land of oz is no orphan in that regard if the enemies of state were looking for insidious all pervasive policy perfectly designed to wreck an economy from within while barely raising a murmur amongst the proles they need look no further than ratcheting up subsidies mandates and targets for intermittent and unreliable wind and solar australia s wind and solar capital south australia set and met its very own 50 ret it pays the world s highest power prices as a result little wonder it s an economic backwater critically dependent upon make work schemes funded by commonwealth taxpayers once upon a time it enjoyed the cheapest power prices in australia and was a manufacturing powerhouse places like south australia denmark and germany put paid to the lie that wind and solar are both cheap and reliable but as michael shellenberger points out the real purpose of heavily subsidised and chaotically intermittent wind and solar is to drive power prices beyond the reach of the proletariat thereby depriving power to all but the truly green elite that is the same class of characters that fly first class around the globe hectoring everybody else on why they should live like paupers while they live it up we shouldn t be surprised renewables make energy expensive since that s always been the greens goal forbes michael shellenberger 27 may 2019 the green party s success in last weekend s european elections will likely result in demands to expand and extend decades old subsidies to renewables like a lot of people i used to think that subsidies to promote the switch from fossil fuels to solar and wind would be a one time thing once a solar or wind farm was built i thought it would produce electricity forever without further subsidy because sunlight and wind are free renewables would thus allow a sustainable and even circular economy without waste or mining because everything would be recycled but it turns out that only nuclear can produce sufficient clean energy to power a circular economy that s partly because nuclear plants have seen their efficiency increase dramatically nuclear plants used to operate for just 50 of the year now thanks to greater experience in operations and maintenance they operate 93 of the year nuclear plants were expected to run for 40 years but thanks to greater experience they re expected to run for 80 and simple changes to equipment allowed the amount of power produced by existing nuclear plants in the us to increase the equivalent of adding eight full sized reactors by contrast the output of solar panels declines one percent every year for inherently physical reasons and they as well as wind turbines are replaced roughly every two decades as for circularity solar panels and wind turbines are rarely recycled because the energy and labor required to do so are much more expensive than just buying raw materials as a result the vast majority of solar panels and wind turbines are either sent to landfills or join the global electronic waste stream where they are dumped on poor communities in developing nations and that s just at the level of the solar and wind equipment at a societal level the value of energy from solar and wind declines the more of it we add to the electrical grid the underlying reason is physical solar and wind produce too much energy when we don t need it and not enough when we do in 2013 a german economist predicted that the economic value of solar would drop by a whopping 50 when it became just 15 of electricity and that the value of wind would decline 40 once it rose to 30 of electricity six years later the evidence that solar and wind are increasing electricity prices in the real world often without reducing emissions is piling up in 2017 the los angeles times reported that california s electricity prices had risen sharply and hinted it might have to do with the deployment of renewables in 2018 i reported that renewables had contributed to electricity prices rising 50 in germany and five times more in california than in the rest of the us despite generating just 17 of the state s electricity and in april a research institute at the university of chicago led by a former obama administration economist found solar and wind were making electricity significantly more expensive across the united states the cost to consumers of renewables has been staggeringly high two weeks ago der spiegel reported that germany spent 36 billion per year on renewables over the last five years and yet only increased the share of electricity from solar and wind by 10 percentage points it s been a similar story in the us all in all wrote the university of chicago economists consumers in the 29 states had paid 125 2 billion more for electricity than they would have in the absence of the policy some renewable energy advocates protest that more evidence is needed to prove that it is renewables and not some hidden factor that is making electricity expensive but there is a growing consensus among economists and independent analysts that solar and wind are indeed making electricity more expensive for two reasons they are unreliable thus requiring 100 back up and energy dilute thus requiring extensive land transmission lines and mining after the los angeles times failed to plainly connect the dots between california s simultaneous rise in electricity prices and renewables a leading economist with the university of california pointed out the obvious the story of how california s electric system got to its current state is a long and gory one james bushnell wrote but the dominant policy driver in the electricity sector has unquestionably been a focus on developing renewable sources of electricity generation renewables are for degrowth we shouldn t be surprised that renewables are making energy expensive for as long as greens have been advocating renewables they have viewed their high cost as a feature not a bug environmentalists have for decades argued that energy is too cheap and must be made more expensive in order to protect the environment greens viewed energy as the source of humankind s destruction of the natural world and sought to restrict energy supplies in order to slow and eventually reverse the destruction indeed the reason environmentalists turned against nuclear energy in the 1960s was that it was cheap and effectively infinite in the early 1970s the sierra club s executive director advocated scaring the public about nuclear to increase regulations to make it more expensive and that s what his organization and many others proceeded to do over the next four decades but greens got the relationship between energy and the environment backward as people consume higher levels of energy the overall environmental impact is overwhelmingly positive not negative as we consume greater amounts of energy we can live in cities stop using wood as fuel and afford to have fewer children and as humans use more energy for agriculture in the form of tractors and fertilizers we are able to grow more food on less land allowing marginal lands to return to grasslands forests and wildlife over time rising electricity consumption such as for high speed trains in population dense places like europe and asia drives the transition from fossil fuels to zero emissions nuclear engineers and other critics of renewables often assume greens are simply misinformed many if not most of them are i certainly was few university environmental studies students today for example ever learn of the mostly positive relationship between rising energy consumption and environmental protection fewer learn that the energy density of the fuel whether wood coal sunlight wind or uranium determine energy s environmental impact because sunlight is energy dilute solar panels are the most extractive of all energy resources requiring 17 times the resources as nuclear while returning just 2 the energy invested but the ideologically driven leadership of european greens and american environmentalists knows renewables make energy expensive and view raising energy prices as a high priority in 1994 then vice president al gore pushed an energy tax as a central plank in the clinton administration s environmental agenda which later evolved into a complicated and corrupt cap and trade proposal such taxes hurt the poor the most and were wildly unpopular as energy taxes failed politically environmentalists in the us and greens in europe focused instead on subsidizing or mandating renewables at bottom renewables make electricity expensive by returning so little energy relative to the energy invested for instance solar panels with storage deliver just 1 6 times as much energy as is invested as compared to the 75 times more energy delivered with nuclear greens and environmentalists also seek to make food another form of energy more expensive they do so by making agriculture more labor intensive land intensive and resource intensive moving to organics as greens demand and away from synthetic fertilizer to manure would require doubling the amount of land required for agriculture currently humans use a whopping 38 of the ice free surface of the earth for agriculture moving to organics would thus decimate the 15 of the ice free surface of the earth that humans have to date protected for wildlife conservation and destroy much beyond that too making farming more labor intensive would take humankind back toward an agrarian economy where far more people work in farming and everybody is much poorer unlike the original new deal a green new deal would thus result in what greens call de growth not growth the idea of de growth came out of efforts by malthusian greens in the 1960s and 70s to persuade developing nations to cede control of their natural resources to earth scientists under the auspices of the united nations originally the green party in britain advocated deindustrialization a return to living in small peasant communities the sterilization of women and an end to all immigration it was only in the last decade that greens started insisting that the renewables transition would create jobs as part of a green new deal what they rarely mention is that the jobs are usually low paying and low skill like spreading low yield solar and wind collectors across landscapes or collecting and spreading manure at organic farms circling down there is a perfect fit between the abstract physical theories economic predictions and real world effects of renewables it was predictable that energy dilute renewable fuels like sunlight and wind would require far more land than either fossil fuels or nuclear and they do it was predictable that renewables with such a low return on energy invested would fail to produce enough energy to make recycling worthwhile and they have and it was predictable that such unreliable technologies would make energy so expensive and they did consider that while our high energy economy can produce solar panels and wind turbines a low energy economy cannot imagine solar panels powering the mining trucks and factories needed to manufacture solar panels there would hardly be any energy left over for society s other needs in that sense the renewables powered economy is circular but not in a way that produces abundant energy for infinite recycling rather renewables powered economies are circular in the sense of spiraling downward as in a drain or like a snake eating its tail until there is nothing left forbes
imperialism socialism coups dictatorship and democracy food shortages inflation violence death the situation in venezuela has been in and out of the news as the nation s economic and political crisis keeps evolving after opposition leader juan guaidó led a failed push to oust president nicolás maduro no one is sure what will happen next indeed with the speed of the news cycle many have probably lost track of what exactly is going on in the country in light of this it is worth looking back on how venezuela got in this situation background it all goes back to hugo chávez the charismatically eccentric left wing populist who was elected president of venezuela in 1998 in that role he declared a bolivarian revolution after latin american independence leader simón bolívar with the goal of implementing socialism of the twenty first century he won the support of impoverished and working class venezuelans by nationalizing industry redistributing wealth and setting up programs like universal healthcare chávez s defenders like the center for economic and policy research credit him with increasing economic growth reducing poverty and unemployment and expanding education among other achievements however chávez also ruled venezuela like a dictator he packed the courts and the state owned oil company pdvsa with his loyalists he censored journalists who disagreed with him he organized civilian militias to intimidate opponents unsurprisingly this conduct attracted criticism chávez s fiercest opponents were business elites and others who had to lose from his left wing policies but politically minded citizens from across the political spectrum also took issue with his authoritarian ways in 2002 a coup removed chávez from power but he managed to regain control after 48 hours it was later revealed that the bush administration if nothing else had prior knowledge of the coup the event portended a decade of hostile relations between chávez and what he denounced as american imperialism the remainder of his rule had its ups and downs but things were mostly stable his social programs were expensive but he paid for them using pdvsa oil the system was rife with corruption but it worked for as long as the oil market boomed needless to say the good times did not last forever after chávez died in 2013 his vice president nicolás maduro won the presidency by a margin of 1 49 in a disputed election it only went downhill from there as oil prices fell national debt grew and inflation exploded the imf estimates a 2019 inflation rate of ten million percent under maduro the country faced shortages of food and medicine poverty reached 90 percent millions fled to colombia and other countries any progress that took place under chávez had vanished in the us commentators debate whether venezuela s problems are the fault of socialism or whether they are just a nonideological example of bad governance this dispute has no satisfying answer but it should be noted that although chávez positioned himself on the far left he fell short of socialist ideals like nationalizing the means of production in 2010 fox news itself reported on the booming private sector under chávez regardless of the cause venezuela was in crisis by 2018 the idea that maduro could maintain popular support was laughable when he won that year s presidential election in a landslide amid allegations of fraud western nations were quick to declare the results illegitimate meanwhile the opposition decided that the time for action had come the leadership dispute the venezuelan constitution written under chávez is not exactly clear on how to handle an illegitimate president but when the presidency is vacant it does say that the president of the national assembly the equivalent of speaker of the house becomes the interim president thus the holder of that position little known centrist juan guaidó took up the mantle on january 23 2019 he quickly received recognition from the us and a majority of latin america and european countries most of them called for a peaceful negotiations and new elections but the trump administration did not rule out military action regardless maduro refused to budge he had control of government apparatuses and the support of his ideological allies and trading partners including cuba russia china turkey and iran as long as he could sit comfortably in the presidential palace of miraflores he intended to remain there from there venezuela entered a cold civil war two different men claimed to be the legitimate president violent clashes occurred and events like a nationwide blackout raised tensions but for months the situation was eerily stable operation freedom this changed on april 30 guaidó appeared in a video alongside military officers and opposition politician leopold lópez who was imprisoned in 2014 but had apparently just been freed from house arrest by military defectors in the video guaidó called for an uprising in the capital of caracas with the goal of overthrowing maduro clashes continued on may 1 known in venezuela as el día del trabajador the day of the worker may day should have been a high point for the socialist government but the street battles ended in stalemate demonstrating maduro s failure to cultivate the same amount of support as chávez however this is not a popularity contest guaidó s goal is to force the military into a position where it must overthrow maduro for the good of the country while some officers have gone to his side however the bulk of the leadership stands with the government as of april 2 the opposition has failed to make much progress but guaidó is not standing down as reports come of events such as military vehicles running into anti maduro protestors it seems that the situation will only escalate what does the us have to do with it according to maduro venezuela s woes are all the fault of a us plot while this is an obvious ploy to evade his share of the blame such a claim is not without merit the us has a long history of interfering with latin american countries politics often to the detriment of the people living there among other actions the trump administration has ramped up sanctions with the goal of destabilizing the maduro regime the full extent of the us s behind the scenes activities is as of yet unknown the white house s strong support for guaidó allegedly comes from a love of democracy but this explanation overstates the benevolence of the us government president trump engages in friendly negotiations with kim jong un who is perhaps the most brutal dictator on the face of the earth why is he so outraged by a second rate strongman like maduro issues in international politics have layers to them and venezuela is no different in 2017 the center for strategic and international studies listed reasons that the us should involve itself in venezuela most of them pragmatic among them the presence of a hostile power along the caribbean endangers us strategic interests in addition the economic crisis and resulting emigration have only added to regional instability and of course venezuela s oil wealth cannot be ignored one could have dismissed this as a conspiracy theory until national security advisor john bolton admitted in a fox business interview that opportunities for us oil companies are a consideration in the administration s actions other countries are also imposing themselves on the region but none of them have the same military strength and willingness to act as the us the national interest described russian troops in venezuela as a joke the situation is america s to shape but with the events of vietnam and iraq in mind it is important to avoid rash action what happens now neither maduro guaidó nor any of their supporters are likely to step down any time soon if the course does not change venezuela is at risk of falling into further civil strife the trump administration is openly considering military action but the fantasy of the venezuelan people welcoming us troops as liberators is unlikely to come to pass even the archetype of successful us intervention in latin america the 1989 removal of panamanian dictator manuel noriega sparked massive debate over civilian death tolls that ranged somewhere between the hundreds and thousands maduro will be harder to remove than noriega popular opinion is difficult to gauge in a country in crisis but a poll conducted in 2018 suggests that a majority of venezuelans support maduro s ouster but also oppose foreign military intervention at this point some venezuelans would indeed welcome us troops kicking maduro out of miraflores but many others would fight to the death to prevent such an event maduro maintains chávez s network of violent pro government militias even in the best case scenario of a peaceful democratic transition at least some of them will take to guerrilla warfare in the mountains in the worst case scenario they could launch a brutal civil war of course a surprise is still possible in a cnn interview on may 1 secretary of state mike pompeo claimed that maduro briefly planned to abscond his office and flee to cuba so long as his personal safety is assured the president may be willing to leave behind the mess that he created meanwhile the economist envisions a scenario where guaidó wins the support of the military and low ranking government officials to oust maduro and form a unity government of course this is much easier said than done at this point nothing is impossible but no one should hold their breath for an easy solution to emerge in venezuela whether maduro or guaidó comes out on top the end of the power struggle is only the beginning of a much longer journey to rebuild

in this may 8 2019 photo president donald trump speaks at a rally in panama city beach fla trump s combative approach to trade has been one of the main constants among his often shifting political views he s showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies ap photo evan vucci read more president donald trump has upped the ante in his trade war with china wrong footing nearly everyone by the move just a few weeks ago expectations were strong that an agreement ending the war or at least putting it on hold was imminent but suddenly a number of darker scenarios seem possible even one in which we suffer a recession it is unclear what prompted trump to raise tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports from 10 percent to 25 percent and another 50 billion in chinese imports already have a 25 percent tariff trump has suggested that the chinese were backtracking on provisions of the trade deal he was negotiating with them the president may also be engaged in some brinkmanship as he appears emboldened by the resilient u s economy to extract concessions from china the reaction in financial markets has been modest so far stock prices are down only a few percent from the record high set just prior to trump s tariff hike investor expectations remain strong that the u s and china will soon come to terms this seems the most likely scenario given the difficult progress in the discussions up to now the costs to the economy and stock market if the war drags on and trump s innate desire to deal odds are that some type of arrangement will be struck by the end of june when both trump and chinese president xi jinping will be at the g20 meeting in japan advertisement if so the 10 year old economic expansion will continue our economy will be diminished by trump s trade policies but it will not be bowed by them complicating things however is trump s recent decision to put huawei the massive chinese telecommunications company on the so called entity list of foreign firms that american companies need u s government permission to do business with this is not just a slap at huawei because the company is an iconic symbol of china s economic success it is also a slap at chinese national pride if nationalism infects the trade discussions an all out trade war may very well ensue this would include trump putting a 25 percent tariff on all chinese imports to the u s about a fifth of all our imports the higher tariffs would hit the u s chinese and global economies hard businesses can navigate around the impact of a 10 percent tariff they can reduce their profits pass along some of the costs and source their imports from different countries but navigating around a 25 percent tariff would prove impossible global supply chains will be severely disrupted you and i will feel the ill effects of the trade war for the first time because we will have to pay much more for many of the things we buy from walmart or amazon so far the tariffs have been largely on items that businesses use but if the war escalates prices for everything from clothes to toys will jump and china won t take it lying down it will almost certainly retaliate by raising tariffs on u s exports to china making it more difficult for u s businesses to obtain regulatory approvals or delaying customs clearance for u s goods it could even allow the yuan to depreciate further in value as it did last year when the trade war first broke out an even more extreme step would be for china to stop selling rare earth metals that only it has in large quantities and that are critical to the production of high tech goods or the chinese could boycott u s goods altogether as they did japanese cars a few years ago imagine what would happen to the u s stock market if the chinese stopped buying iphones and then there is the nuclear option china could unload its massive holdings of u s treasuries which would cause our interest rates to spike the likelihood of going down this dark path still seems low but it is a recipe for a u s chinese and global recession later this year the federal reserve would attempt to cushion the economic blow by cutting rates and the chinese would pump up monetary and fiscal stimulus however these efforts would fall short the length and depth of the downturn would depend on how long it takes trump to ultimately call a truce there is good reason to engage china on its trade practices and generally poor behavior in international commerce but trump s trade war is a costly and likely ineffective way of getting china to reform there is a general consensus that trump won t push it too far once it does show up in lower stock prices and weaker u s growth he will relent this makes sense but it is important to carefully consider alternative scenarios
new york when trade tensions with china flared last year many companies sought refuge in a country with a long stable relationship with the united states mexico now that alternative for production and materials may also be in jeopardy with us president donald trump s threat to impose escalating tariffs on imports from mexico aimed at forcing action on illegal immigration in the short term the tariffs would mean lower profits for american importers and higher prices for american consumers in the long run they could force companies to reconsider the continent spanning supply chains that have made north america one of the world s most interconnected economies that disruption experts warn could be far more damaging to the us economy than the cost of tariffs the us imported more than us 345 billion s 474 billion in goods from mexico last year and shipped us 265 billion the other way but if anything these numbers understate the interdependence american refiners process crude oil from mexico then sell it back as petrol about 30 per cent of the content of mexican exports originated in the us according to a recent study our ties to mexico are in many ways much more immediate than china and in some ways much more powerful said mr pete guarraia who leads supply chain consulting for bain mr trump has often criticised mexico and the us companies that have relocated production there but his trade policies have largely focused on china a target of successive rounds of tariffs on billions of dollars in imports us companies have responded by moving production and supply chains out of china in some cases to mexico which this year has displaced china as the us top trading partner the attraction of doing so only increased when the us mexico and canada reached a deal last autumn to replace the north american free trade agreement now those plans have been thrown into turmoil mexico was the place that people were looking to move to said mr joseph fitzgerald a partner in deloitte s supply chain practice now it s gosh we just got through one wave of supply chain strategy and structural change and now we need to start a new round economists said the direct effects of a tariff of 5 per cent or even 10 per cent would probably be small especially with a strong economy and low inflation the larger threat they said was the disruption they could cause for carmakers and others who have come to rely on supply chains that seamlessly cross international boundaries those supply chains will not fray overnight said mr brian dunch a trade expert at pricewaterhousecoopers but over time they could break down particularly if companies decide they cannot trust trade rules to be consistent it s the cumulative effect of all this uncertainty he said you ll see supply chains balkanise nytimes
americans are suffering from a bad case of loneliness the number of people in the united states living alone has gone through the studio apartment roof a study released by the insurance company cigna last spring made headlines with its announcement only around half of americans say they have meaningful daily face to face social interactions loneliness public health experts tell us is killing as many people as obesity and smoking it s not much comfort that americans are not well alone in this germans are lonely the bon vivant french are lonely and even the scandinavians the happiest people in the world according to the un s world happiness report are lonely too british prime minister theresa may recently appointed a minister of loneliness the hard evidence for a loneliness epidemic admittedly has some issues how is loneliness different from depression how much do living alone and loneliness overlap do social scientists know how to compare today s misery with that in say the mid twentieth century a period that produced prominent books like the lonely crowd certainly some voguish explanations for the crisis should raise skepticism among the recent suspects are favorite villains like social media technology discrimination genetic bad luck and neoliberalism still the loneliness thesis taps into a widespread intuition of something true and real and grave foundering social trust collapsing heartland communities an opioid epidemic and rising numbers of deaths of despair suggest a profound collective discontent it s worth mapping out one major cause that is simultaneously so obvious and so uncomfortable that loneliness observers tend to mention it only in passing i m talking of course about family breakdown at this point the consequences of family volatility are an evergreen topic when it comes to children this remains the subject of countless papers and conferences now we should take account of how deeply the changes in family life of the past 50 odd years are intertwined with the flagging well being of so many adults and communities scholars sometimes refer to the domestic earthquake that first rumbled through wealthy countries like the u s in the mid twentieth century as the second demographic transition the first transition occurred around the time of the industrial revolution as the high death and birth rates that had been humanity s default condition since the neanderthals declined dramatically leading to rapid population growth mostly associated with the belgian demographer ron lesthaeghe the sdt the unfortunately evocative acronym is a useful framework for understanding the dramatic rupture between the ozzie and harriet and sex and the city eras the sdt began emerging in the west after world war ii as societies became richer and goods cheaper and more plentiful people no longer had to rely on traditional families to afford basic needs like food and shelter they could look up the maslovian ladder toward post material goods self fulfillment exotic and erotic experiences expressive work education values changed to facilitate these goals people in wealthy countries became more antiauthoritarian more critical of traditional rules and roles and more dedicated to individual expression and choice with the help of the birth control pill non conventional household formation divorce remarriage cohabitation and single parenthood went from uncommon for some even shameful to mundane lesthaeghe predicted that low fertility would also be part of the sdt package as families grew less central and low fertility he suggested would have thorny repercussions for nation states he was one of the first to guess that developed countries would turn to immigrants to restock their aging populations as native born young adults found more fulfilling things to do than clean up after babies or cook dinner for sullen adolescents the disruption of family life caused by the sdt in the u s has been rehearsed thousands of times including by this writer but the numbers still startle in 1950 20 percent of marriages ended in divorce today it s approximately 40 percent four in ten american children are now born to unmarried mothers up from about 5 percent in 1960 in 1970 84 percent of u s children spent their entire childhoods living with both bio parents today only half can expect to do the same lesthaeghe was prophetic about what would happen to fertility in wealthy countries in the u s the percentage of childless women doubled between 1970 and the mid 2000s today 14 percent of u s women past their childbearing years have never given birth that actually makes us more fertile than some other developed countries in germany nearly a quarter of women end up childless the u s number might more closely resemble the german figure if it weren t for our high levels of immigration most of it from poor countries that haven t yet embraced the change in attitudes in 2015 in six u s states more than 30 percent of births were to foreign born women postwar baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964 were generation zero for the second demographic transition in the united states now shuffling their way into their sixties and seventies older boomers give a glimpse of the long term downside of the post sdt culture if we had to pick just one word to describe it lonely would do in widely quoted research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences ashton m verdery and rachel margolis uncovered a recent surge in the number of kinless older adults lower fertility translates into fewer siblings aunts uncles and cousins whether for hospital visits or emergency contacts a jump in the number of never married and divorced adults is also part of the kinlessness story boomers were the first generation to divorce in large numbers and they continue to split up even as they amble into their golden years giving rise to the phenomenon known as gray divorce the divorce rate has doubled for people over 50 since 1990 in 2017 senate testimony robert putnam author of the 2000 milestone bowling alone and the national prophet of social capital decline cautioned that for all these reasons boomers will face a more lonesome old age than their greatest generation parents oughly 12 percent fewer of the mid boomer birth cohort of 1955 will be living with spouses when they reach age 65 than was true of the birth cohort of 1930 he observed those boomers will also have 36 percent fewer children than the earlier cohort divorce has frayed ties between boomers and the children that they do have divorced fathers tend to stay close to their children in the months and years immediately following separation but for various reasons they often drift away over time and the younger the child at the time of the breakup the less likely it is that fathers will continue to be involved waiting till the kids have moved out as the gray divorce boomlet suggests that lots of couples are doing is not as strong protection from a kin deficit as one might expect gray divorce damages parents relationships with their adult children too divorce didn t turn boomers off to marriage entirely a substantial number plunged in again but instead of replacing defunct relationships remarriage further fragmented family ties for one thing when parents remarry it often brings jealousies bad chemistry and resentments into their relationships with their children that s especially true when a parent starts a second family with a new spouse given the overscheduling of contemporary childhood not to mention the emotions provoked by ex spouses it s inevitable that fathers who remarry or whose ex wives remarry become an afterthought to or an irritating intrusion into their children s daily family routines the other reason remarriage frequently fails to replenish kin networks is that second marriages are even more likely to break up than first and third unions are flimsier still divorced people generally can t count on ex wives or husbands to provide much companionship or support when they have a heart attack or a close friend dies studies also show unsurprisingly that stepchildren don t care for needy stepparents as much as they do their biological parents that s especially true in gray remarriages when kids are likely to be older when a stepparent enters the picture as verdery and margolis sum up evidence is accumulating that the legacy of divorce and remarriage has a long reach straining inter generational relationships and suppressing the support that divorced parents stepparents and remarried biological parents might expect from their children in later life the authors don t mention cohabitation but it s a key ingredient in the rise of kinlessness superficially cohabitation looks roughly equivalent to marriage couples live together as husband and wife sharing a bed living space meals and in many cases children but without the ring and city hall certificate in reality especially in the u s shacking up is a kind of marriage lite that has added to the tenuousness of post transition relations cohabiting couples break up faster and more often than marrieds separated cohabiting fathers are more likely to withdraw from their kids lives than previously married and divorced dads who are already more unreliable than married dads still in the house one study of low income cohabiting parents found that within three years half the fathers had moved out a considerable number would vanish from their kids lives entirely cohabiting and single parents also have looser ties to their own parents and friends than marrieds according to the 2018 cigna study single parents are about the loneliest of americans in translating family formation into a strictly private matter the sdt whistled past a critical fact of our history namely that kinship has been the most powerful glue of human groups since homo sapiens first discovered the mother in law evolutionary psychologists have a compelling theory about why humans practiced reciprocal altruism in relation to kin because they had a stake in the reproductive success of their genetic relations even evolutionary psychology skeptics though might notice that though marriage has shape shifted over the centuries and across cultures it has always defined those people spouses parents children grandparents siblings in laws to whom we owe special attention and mutual protection that would explain why cohabiting couples even those with children don t have the same support from extended family as married couples with children marriage creates kin cohabitation does not some of the most crucial obligations of kinship have always been to tend to the sick and to bury the dead even today the vast majority of unpaid caretaking of the aging in the u s is done by relatives according to putnam in 2015 the new york times magazine published a memorable article the lonely death of george bell that captures the existential plight of the kinless the subject was a 74 year old queens man whose body was discovered by police after neighbors complained about the foul odor coming from his apartment his badly decomposed body left him unrecognizable but even had he been found earlier only one or two people on earth could have id d him george bell had no brothers or sisters his parents were both long dead he had no children and he had never married the kinless elderly are often hoarders who hang on to every stray electric bill used coffee cup or odd bit of broken furniture that enters their apartment perhaps the chaos of useless objects is the objective correlative of their sense of abandonment the article describes one woman whose apartment was so swollen with belongings that died standing up unable to collapse to the floor bell s own stash which took seven hours to clear out included four new tire gauges and six unopened ironing board covers the kinless elderly are often hoarders who hang on to every stray electric bill used coffee cup or odd bit of broken furniture a death like bell s mobilizes an impressive cadre of officials in addition to junk removers and cleaners a medical examiner who calls local doctors and hospitals to see if anyone has records for the deceased a medical legal investigator to rule out foul play police detectives to track down close relatives or friends by calling phone numbers found in papers strewn around the apartment and when that fails a decedent property agent who disposes of unclaimed property a kinship investigator required by law to find next of kin down to first cousin once removed and employees of both the city chosen funeral home and crematory after creating a family tree the investigator learned of several cousins scattered around the country and abroad as it happened they were themselves dead or couldn t be reached or said that they hadn t spoken to bell in decades investigators found a will with four legatees including a long ago girlfriend she was notified about the bequest but died before she received it which meant that the money mostly from the sale of bell s apartment went to her own legatees who had never met or even heard of him n r kleinfield who wrote the piteous story pieced together some details of bell s life one of which was full of tragic irony given the anonymous isolation of his demise he had fed and bathed his mother who had severe arthritis in her old age until her death for a fuller picture of the brave new kinless world consider japan a country now in the throes of an epidemic of kodokushi roughly translated as lonely deaths local japanese papers regularly publish stories about kinless elderly whose deaths go unnoticed until the telltale smell of maggot eaten flesh alerts neighbors such deaths are common enough that japanese entrepreneurs have created an industry of cleaning companies for dealing with their aftereffects last year a reporter watched as workers clad in full body protective gear from one of those companies with the chilling name next disinfected the apartment of hiroaki a 54 year old divorced man with no children no one noticed that he had been gone for four months and even then it was only because hiroaki s rent money which had been automatically deducted from a savings account had dried up a representative of the building s management company finally discovered his decomposed remains on a soiled futon lonely death cleaning companies promise to be a good investment in japan the culture s legendary filial piety has gone the way of the samurai children and grandchildren are often too busy or far away for regular visiting and that s for the lucky ones who have progeny a record number of young people are forgoing marriage just as they are in the united states but unlike other post transition countries japan is not replacing marriage with nonconventional family arrangements divorce nonmarital births single parents and cohabitation remain rare oddly even sex appears to be losing its appeal for young japanese men and women the country s fertility rate is about the lowest in the world and despite prime minister shinzo abe s support for parental leave tax incentives and various other measures designed to increase births there s no sign of public enthusiasm for marriage and baby making the general concept of family in japan has fallen apart as masaki ichinose of the centre for life and death studies at the university of tokyo told the washington post florian gaertner photothek getty images one way to respond to lonely deaths is with an existential shrug we are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow men pascal wrote wretched as we are powerless as we are they will not aid us we shall die alone loneliness is as much a part of the human condition as joy you could argue and at any rate it is a price we should be willing to pay for freedom from dictatorial patriarchal rule the second demographic transition offered relief from many of life s most palpable miseries hectoring or depressed wives abusive or sullen or just hapless husbands controlling relatives and taboos on premarital and gay sex it expanded emotional and psychological horizons and attachments to new people places and experiences and gave us permission to explore myriad ways to eat pray and love how many would choose to sacrifice those freedoms even if doing so could guarantee a crowded funeral hard nosed realists could also correctly point out that over romanticizing family bonds has its own risks people can feel lonely and despairing amid a boisterous family thanksgiving dinner if family members inspire our most intense love they can also provoke the most rage and frustration and let s not forget that many people want to live alone researching going solo the extraordinary rise and surprising appeal of living alone sociologist eric klinenberg was surprised to hear from most of his elderly subjects especially women that they preferred living by themselves to the available alternatives including living with their children yet these benefits shouldn t prevent a clear eyed accounting of other blowback from the second demographic transition that goes beyond lonely deaths the transition helped shape a social ecology that would worsen some of our most vexing social problems including growing inequality throughout the western world wealthier more educated parents tend more often to be married before they have children and to stay married than do their less advantaged fellow citizens their children benefit not just from their parents financial advantages with all the computer camps and dance lessons that a flush checking account can buy but from the familiar routines and predictable households that seem to help the young figure out the complex world they ll be entering the children of lower income less educated parents by contrast are more likely to see their married parents divorce or their cohabiting parents separate and then to have to readjust to the strangers stepparents boyfriends or girlfriends step or half siblings who come into their lives some children will be introduced to a succession of newcomers as their parents divorce or separate a second or even third time why after the transition did the rich continue to have reasonably stable and predictable domestic lives while the working class and poor stumbled onto what family scholar andrew cherlin calls the marriage go round observers typically point to deindustrialization and the loss of stable decent paying low skilled jobs for men true enough a jobless man especially one without a high school diploma is no one s idea of a good catch but there s more to the marriage gap than that while the loosening of traditional rules gave women freedom to leave violent or cruel husbands it also changed the cultural environment for couples trying to weather less dangerous stresses and disappointments including a pink slip lower income men and women are bound to have more financial anxieties more work accidents and more broken down cars and evictions and they lack the funds for disneyland vacations massages and psychotherapists that might take some of the edge off a struggling marriage and they see few if any long term married couples who could offer a successful model with single parenthood and cohabitation both on the lifestyle menu what they see instead is an easy out when so many marriages melt into thin air lower income kin networks a source of job connections child care and family meals attenuate as well your mother s sister s husband your uncle by marriage might give you a tip about a job opening at a local machine shop an uncle separated from your aunt and living with a girlfriend with her own kids in the next town over maybe not communities flush with fatherless households tend to be troubled in his landmark study of county level social mobility economist raj chetty discovered that places thick with married couple families created more opportunity for kids regardless of whether they were living in a married or single parent household places with large numbers of single parent homes on the other hand pulled kids down including those living with married parents it s hard to imagine more concrete evidence of the truth of the old cliché that family is the building block of society racial inequality predates the transition of course but with their families and communities already weakened by slavery racism and clumsy government policies black americans were hit hard verdery and margolis believe that blacks are at especially high risk of kinlessness as they age black women are two times as likely as whites to have never married by age 45 and two times as likely to be divorced widowed or separated seventy two percent of black children are born to unmarried mothers black nonresidential fathers tend to see their kids more than do white men living apart from their offspring in the early months and years of the child s life but over time they fade out of the picture an oncologist of my acquaintance working at an inner city hospital tells me that he sees a remarkable number of black men arriving at the clinic for treatment by themselves if they get hospitalized visitors are sparse as they near death still no one comes my poor mother like many other slave women had many children but no family frederick douglass once wrote many black men could now say something similar about themselves family instability and fatherlessness collide with racial and economic disadvantage to create a negative feedback loop in black communities hampering children s potential and perpetuating racial inequality black children are by far the least likely of any demographic group to go through childhood living with both parents considering that kids from single parent homes black and white have less chance of completing high school and college and a greater chance of becoming single parents themselves the current calculus of inequality will endure a just published study by demographer john iceland concludes that differences in family structure are the most significant variable in explaining the black white affluence gap in fact its importance has grown over time relative to other explanations including discrimination unable to pool earnings with a spouse to take advantage of economies of scale and to share child care black single parents have a tougher time than their married counterparts building a nest egg in more recent decades the transition has eroded the god fearing middle american white working class family too and their communities as of 1980 about 75 percent of white working class adults were married a figure very close to the 79 percent of high income adults by 2017 however the working class number had fallen to only 52 percent worse white working class adults divorce at much higher rates than more educated adults the white working class family is today more fragile than the black family was at the time of the famous alarm sounding 1965 report on the negro family by daniel patrick moynihan putnam has written j d vance s best selling hillbilly elegy evokes that fragility his parents divorced when he was little and his father disappeared from his life until he was a teenager a series of his mother s boyfriends and husbands cycled through j d s childhood his maternal grandmother fought constantly with her drunken husband once dousing him with gasoline and setting him on fire the crumbling of the white working class family has contributed to the country s opioid crisis opioids are now the leading cause of death for people under 50 a majority of them are unmarried or divorced men though only 32 percent of the population that group of adults accounts for a stunning 71 percent of opioid deaths opioids themselves now a larger cause of american deaths than car accidents are poisoning the foundational kinship bond between parents and children officials believe that opioids are at the root of a heartrending increase in foster care placements fourteen states experienced a 25 percent rise or more in the number of kids sent to foster care between 2011 and 2015 maine saw a 45 percent increase in that same period can it be a coincidence that the drug dominating today s headlines provokes a similar response in the brain as the hormone oxytocin does oxytocin sometimes called the love hormone occurs naturally at moments of intense love and connection during childbirth breastfeeding and orgasm opioids andrew sullivan wrote in a powerful essay on the epidemic in new york have given the lonely a shortcut and an instant intensification of the happiness might ordinarily experience in a good and fruitful communal life and finally there is family breakdown s role in the deaths of despair as economists anne case and angus deaton call the exploding number of deaths by suicide alcohol abuse and drug overdose case and deaton shocked demographers and policymakers several years ago when they published findings showing that the increase was enough to reverse the long term trend toward longer healthier lives one of the proudest signs of human progress in the first decades of the twenty first century suicide suddenly surged for both white men and white women case and deaton found these deaths especially common among people with only high school or less education and among separated divorced and widowed though not single men public health researchers have known for a long time that unmarried men and women are at higher risk of early death from a variety of diseases one spouse might find a suspicious looking mole on the other s back or notice if she s drinking more than her usual and who hasn t heard accounts of relatives stopping harried nurses from giving patients the wrong medication notice that men are more likely to die from opioid overdoses and other deaths of despair men seem to have a harder time coping with isolation and family breakdown than women most of the lonely deaths in japan are men fathers continue to have more tenuous relations with their children than mothers do despite growing cultural preference for gender equal child care a 2016 report from the university of michigan population studies center found that an extraordinary 20 percent of young adults in the u s have absolutely no contact with their fathers not including those who have died far higher than the 6 5 percent who no longer talked to their mothers women initiate more divorces and when the papers are signed according to a pew survey they are more likely to swear off marriage for good men tend to want to remarry in going solo klinenberg discovered that women are far more adept at creating their own social networks going out with groups of friends volunteering at local charities and the like single women will purchase a home more often than do single men even after the sdt women are the more intuitive homemakers turn the place completely upside down inside out and you still won t find a solution to kinlessness social isolation and their tragic fallout in the office of a minister of loneliness government can fund services for the isolated and frail elderly many american cities have neighborhood senior centers with help desks and activities to keep the aged active and socially connected civil society has also jumped in with groups like meals on wheels and seniors helping seniors churches and other religious institutions help keep an eye on elderly congregants these efforts are undeniably beneficial sometimes they save lives but when you consider the more damaging systemic changes wrought by the transition they are little more than aspirin for a gaping wound though there s no going back to a time when people had little freedom to pursue personal life on their own terms there are reasons to think that some healing is possible the transition put unprecedented personal autonomy up for sale but as it happened relatively few were interested in buying the whole package an innate human desire for elemental familial bonds continued to assert itself in surveys americans today describe family relations as the most meaningful part of their lives far surpassing work and friends post transition europeans are no less sold on family as the major source of meaning in life as they reach middle age most americans remain heavily involved in supporting and advising elderly parents american women continue to report a relatively high number of desired children you ve heard about or maybe logged onto ancestry com it s not some soon to be forgotten fad like candy crush to feed short attention spans instead it s tapping into a deep desire to discover family roots that connect us to a place a collective story and a corner of history uprootedness uproots everything except the need for roots as christopher lasch once wrote the challenge is to find ways to communicate that need to coming generations before they make decisions that will further fragment their lives and communities so far that s not happening millennials and their younger brothers and sisters say that they would like to marry and have children but only 30 percent see a successful marriage as one of the more important things in life about half shrug off single parenthood as a nonissue in their view cohabitation is fundamentally the same as marriage though the overall share of american babies born to unmarried mothers has declined a bit in the past few years the majority of births to millennials are to unmarried women so far younger kids gen z as they are sometimes called don t look as though they re ready to rebel from the nonchalance of their older siblings in a 2018 survey of attitudes of 10 to 19 year olds by perryundem research and communication three quarters rated having a successful career as very important fewer than a third said that marrying or having children mattered that much notably boys and girls had almost identical answers this doesn t surprise me my boomer acquaintances college educated professionals and devoted parents nudged and prodded their kids from elementary school through college and beyond to prepare for the big career when it came to that other crucial life goal finding a loyal loving spouse a devoted mother or father for their children their lips were sealed such traditional aspirations would have seemed an imposition on their children s authentic desires rather than a piece of learned wisdom yet learn it they had they danced euphorically at their children s weddings and are now putting dinner companions to sleep rattling on about the grandkids for the most part this studied cultural silence about marriage children and kinship hasn t damaged the prospects for my peers kids to create and sustain bonds so essential to individual and social well being they see these relationships all around them they re part of the air they breathe that s far from the case in less advantaged communities where the most elemental bonds are fraying like a piece of 100 year old muslin most policy discussions about the troubles of the american working class and poor center on vocational and technical education higher paying and reliable jobs and benefits these are necessary efforts but they are not enough to counter the loneliness kinlessness and despair crushing so many spirits there also must be what tom wolfe called a great re learning about how to satisfy the human longing for continuity and connection and it s not just for the sake of the children top photo jonas bendiksen magnum photos
the climate for doing business in latin america worsened between january and april due to turbulence in the brazilian economy the largest in the region according to the quarterly report of the getúlio vargas foundation fgv of brazil and the institute of economic research ifo from germany besides brazil another country that contributed to the worsening of the index was mexico while colombia and peru were the only countries that showed an improvement in the period the argentine trade balance showed a positive balance although it should continue to be closely monitored most central banks have kept rates steady at recent meetings reflecting contained inflation and reduced pressure for the normalization of the global monetary policy the steel market in the region during january to march 2019 showed a 3 drop in the consumption of rolled steel compared to the same period in 2018 the regional production of crude and rolled steel until april decreased by 5 and 9 respectively versus january to april of the previous year still the ups and downs in production for the first four months point to an increase in consumption from january to april the cumulated production of crude and rolled steel was below that indicated in 2018 this year there is a gradual increase and the expectations for the year are growing even if the scenario is not as positive as 2018 the region increased its imports by 17 between february and march 2019 identifying a 4 increase compared to january march 2018 the participation of imports in regional consumption also increased this year regional consumption is now supplied with 37 of these imports in contrast to 35 in the period from january to march of 2018 the same accumulated growth was identified in the first two months 35 37 confirming the dependence on consumption of imported rolled steel in the face of production falls the deficit registered in january march 2019 was 3 5 mt with 342 thousand tons more than january march of the previous year 3 1 mt crude steel production grows but rolled steel production falls in april despite negative oscillations compared to the same accumulated period of 2018 due to changes in consumption and market uncertainties crude steel production increased by 1 and rolled steel production fell by 4 in april respectively compared to march 2019 crude steel latin america had a production of 5 2 mt of crude steel in april 5 6 lower than in the same period of 2018 5 5 mt for the year 2019 21 mt were produced 5 less than jan april 2018 21 9 mt the same cumulative comparison for the first three months also

mexico city mexico president andrés manuel lópez obrador said friday that mexico won t respond to u s president donald trump s threat of coercive tariffs with desperation but instead will push for dialogue a day after trump s threat to impose a 5 tariff that could increase incrementally to 25 on all mexican imports lópez obrador seemed convinced that trump just needed to be informed of all that mexico has been doing to slow illegal migration and he dispatched foreign affairs secretary marcelo ebrard to washington friday we are carrying out our responsibility in immigration policy lópez obrador said at his daily morning news conference he made no promises of new action to stem the flow of mostly central american immigrants transiting mexico to reach the u s border mexico has stepped up raids on migrant caravans travelling through the southern states of chiapas and oaxaca this year it has deported thousands of migrants and frustrated thousands more who wait endlessly for permits that would allow them to travel legally through mexico we have to help so that they don t enter the united states illegally but we also have to do it respecting human rights lópez obrador said nothing authoritarian they re human beings since taking office dec 1 lópez obrador has espoused a longer term immigration fix focused on raising living standards and increasing opportunities so that those who he says are forced to migrate no longer have to on friday he also noted that most of the immigration flow is not mexican but rather citizens of central america s northern triangle countries honduras guatemala and el salvador he referred to those countries crises of unemployment and violence as being the main drivers of illegal immigration lópez obrador has lobbied the u s government and other countries to support a marshall plan like development agreement focused on development in southern mexico and the northern triangle but his medium and long term immigration solutions are colliding with the potential short term benefits for trump of rallying his base during an election cycle with incendiary threats on friday trump resumed his twitter complaints writing mexico has taken advantage of the united states for decades because of the dems our immigration laws are bad mexico makes a fortune from the u s have for decades they can easily fix this problem time for them to finally do what must be done mexico can continue to make it more difficult for migrants to cross the country to the u s border though the smugglers who have plied those routes for decades would benefit from a crackdown but sealing mexico s southern border with guatemala is likely impossible it doesn t have the infrastructure to adequately patrol a border that includes a river passing through jungle lópez obrador has said before that mexico can expect to take some hits from the trump administration as the u s elections near on thursday trump tweeted on june 10th the united states will impose a 5 tariff on all goods coming into our country from mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through mexico and into our country stop the tariff will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied the economic impact for mexico was swift the peso dropped more than 3 against the u s dollar by friday morning mexico s banco base warned that the announced tariffs pose a grave threat for mexico s economic growth outlook since 80 of its exports go to the united states it estimated that the 5 tariff could knock 2 85 percentage points off the growth of mexico s exports but that the weaker peso would help compensate trump s threat came the same day that mexico s government announced it would begin the ratification process of the new agreement with the united states and canada to replace the north american free trade agreement and less than two weeks after mexico successfully negotiated the lifting of steel and aluminum tariffs from the u s that had been a roadblock to ratifying the new trade deal the united states mexico canada agreement was one of the trump administration s most touted achievements but is now once again in jeopardy lópez obrador said that since thursday night he had been receiving messages of support from all sectors of mexican society and felt great solidarity asked by a reporter why mexico would not just skip the dialogue and file a complaint with an international trade body lópez obrador said it was not just a legal question we want to have a good relationship with the united states government copyright 2019 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed photo ap

kuala lumpur june 2 bernama malaysia s inclusion in the united states us treasury s monitoring list of potential currency manipulators is likely a ploy by washington to gain exchange rate competitiveness to boost its exports say experts however it is not expected to have a significant impact due to the country s good trade policy reputation for economic and exchange rate flexibility as well as huge external balance said phillip capital management asia pacific senior vice president investment datuk dr nazri khan adam khan bank negara malaysia bnm had also said that the country s economy was unaffected by it given that i don t think this will affect our economic standing because i think this is temporary and at the end of the day our economic fundamentals and our real competitive edge has nothing to do with the exchange rate he told bernama when asked on the matter malaysia s export advantage is not based on floating rate but product competitiveness he said the number of countries on the us watch list expanded after treasury secretary steven mnuchin lowered the threshold for qualification countries with a current account surplus equivalent to two per cent of gross domestic product gdp are now eligible for the list down from three per cent previously malaysia is among nine countries in the list alongside china germany italy ireland japan south korea singapore and vietnam the inclusion comes with no immediate penalty they are using this list probably to boost american export and to curb the export from emerging countries nazri khan said other thresholds include persistent intervention in markets for a nation s currency and a trade surplus with the us of at least us 20 billion us 1 rm4 18 countries that meet two of the three criteria are placed on the watch list malaysia met two of the three criteria amid a significant bilateral trade surplus with the us of us 27 billion and material current account surplus of 2 1 per cent of gdp in the report the us treasury said that malaysia s central bank has over the last few years intervened in both directions in foreign exchange markets it estimates that in 2018 bnm sold about us 11 billion in foreign exchange which is equivalent to 3 1 per cent of gdp to resist ringgit depreciation however it also welcomes malaysia s external rebalancing in recent years the authorities should pursue appropriate policies to support a continuation of this trend including by encouraging high quality and transparent investment and ensuring sufficient social spending which can help minimise precautionary saving it said this external rebalancing was facilitated by higher levels of both consumption and investment following years of elevated national savings in 2008 gross national saving was 38 per cent of gdp by 2018 it had fallen to 26 per cent of gdp this indicates that the consumption and investment have been very active and the us treasury department appears to be advising that the malaysian government should continue its policies to encourage more high quality and transparent investment as well as ensuring sufficient social spending bank islam malaysia bhd chief economist dr mohd afzanizam abdul rashid said besides the possibility of expanding the social spending he said the government was also expected to continuously execute infrastructure projects that would result in minimal surplus current account balance in that sense we should not be too alarmed whether it would result in massive capital outflows in fact it really goes to show that the malaysian ringgit is undervalued and therefore it should appreciate over time he said malaysia s current account surplus balance had also narrowed substantially to 2 1 per cent of gdp last year from 17 2 per cent of gdp in 2008 showing that the rebalancing had been significant perhaps the ringgit should appreciate given that the average ringgit per us dollar since the country removed the currency peg in july 2005 stood at 3 5657 he added bernama bernama provides up to date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via bernama wires www bernama com bernama tv on astro 502 unifi tv 631 and mytv 121 iflix channels and bernama radio on fm93 9 klang valley fm107 5 johor bahru fm107 9 kota kinabalu and fm100 9 kuching frequencies follow us on social media facebook bernamaofficial bernamatv bernamaradio twitter bernama com bernamatv bernamaradio instagram bernamaofficial bernamatvofficial bernamaradioofficial tiktok bernamaofficial
