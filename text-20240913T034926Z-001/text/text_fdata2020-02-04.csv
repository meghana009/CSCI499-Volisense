the global capital markets were roiled in recent weeks by the new virus that jumped species in china it is contagious during the incubation periods and appears similar though more aggressive than sars in 2003 2004 and china is larger and significantly more integrated into the global political economy the new coronavirus is impactful in several areas outside of the human tragedy it is a blow to ideas of better growth impulses to start the year the outlook for china which had been projected to account for around a sixth of global growth this year has dimmed more stimulus is likely to be part of beijing s answer as many will recall that the sars slowed the economy by two percentage points slower growth will make observers more skeptical of china s ability to fully adhere to the new trade agreement with the us that has measurable quantifiable targets for purchases of broad categories of us goods many american observers were critical of the trade agreement on two seemingly incongruent grounds that it was not severe enough and that china would not be able to achieve the targets it is almost like woody allen s critique of a restaurant that had poor food and small servings the outbreak also triggered what arguably is a long overdue unwinding of risk trades that had spurred significant rallies in equities emerging markets and credit the yen and the swiss franc and dollar strengthened but the us treasuries as the most liquid and transparent market remained the safe haven of choice us yields fell sharply and the yield curve flattened market based measures of inflation expectations fell as the price of oil collapsed 15 in january investors moved to fully discount one quarter point cut by the federal reserve this year and priced in roughly a 60 chance of a second cut a modest gesture to our non consensus scenario that had highlighted the risk of two cuts on one hand the dollar has not adjusted as one might expect to the sharp shift in the outlook for us monetary policy the dollar begins the month looking vulnerable especially against european currencies and the japanese yen the australian dollar s decline may have been exaggerated by the closure of chinese markets for the extended lunar new year holiday as it is often perceived as a liquid proxy on the other hand the dramatic reaction in the bond and equity markets is partly a function of the previous extensive positioning yet just as the pendulum of investor psychology overshot on the upside it is bound to overshoot on the downside creating new opportunities for investors and businesses investors cannot sustain a high level of anxiety for long the commercialization of a vaccination the re opening of china s markets and the lifting of the travel bans are steps necessary to rebuild investor confidence and risk appetites a large part of china will remain closed until at least february 8 and supply chain disruptions and travel are likely to be disrupted longer at the same time most of the g10 central banks do not meet in february which may dampen the response to high frequency data for the most part in the coming weeks the exceptions are the antipodeans australia february 3 and new zealand february 11 and sweden february 12 the uk formally left the european union three and a half years after its referendum and entered into a standstill phase during which time it will negotiate trade agreements with both the eu and the us the negotiations are off to an inauspicious start as the uk rejects regulatory alignment with the eu and insists the negotiations conclude by the end of the year rather than ingratiate itself with the us president trump who unlike his predecessors supported brexit prime minister johnson has antagonized the us by pressing forward with a digital tax and allowing huawei a substantial role in its 5g rollout central bank policy gave way to trade concerns as the chief driver of the capital markets in the last part of 2019 the fallout from the new virus china bequeathed the world was the unanticipated driver in recent weeks without federal reserve european central bank bank of japan or bank of england meetings in february to capture investors attention after unwinding the extreme risk off response to the virus the focus may return to macroeconomic factors dollar in december 14 of 17 federal reserve officials forecast that no change in monetary policy would likely be necessary this year investors disagreement has grown in recent weeks and accelerated as the deflationary impact of the coronavirus became clear interpolating from the fed funds futures the market has completely discounted one rate cut and has about a 60 of a second move priced into prices at the end of january the dollar was resilient against most currencies despite the shift until the end of the month when it weakened against european currencies and yen the output cuts associated with boeing and the disruptions emanating from china will likely be seen quickly in the high frequency data with a tepid employment report expected to kick things off meanwhile interest rate differentials continue to move against the us which we have identified as a late dollar cycle phenomenon the us premium over germany japan and the uk for example on both two year and 10 year borrowings have been trending down since november 2018 and made new lows in late january euro while the downside risks in the eurozone appear to have eased the upside remains muted german manufacturing remains weak and the demonstrations in france over macron s latest reform efforts pensions has had knock on effects on french services italy has managed to avoid a political crisis but the economy unexpectedly contracted 0 3 in q4 19 as did france 0 1 and political tensions may return in the spring with the local elections the german political situation is less precarious as neither the christian democrats nor the social democrats are prepared to go back to the voters who have repeatedly shunned thems within the eurozone the most significant risk is that the expansion does not gather much strength and the slowing in bank lending to non financial business is a sign that the european central bank s transmission mechanism may be faltering that said in late january the german government revised up their growth forecast for this year to 1 1 from 1 0 projected in october this is still modest by any reckoning even if nearly twice as fast as 2019 s 0 6 pace externally the biggest risk is that trade tensions escalate with the us and the precise timing is difficult to

japanese economy is gradually recovering from the double whammy in q4 of the sales tax increase and typhoons prime minister abe s fiscal stimulus and preparations for the summer olympics will help

zimbabwean economy re dollarizing rapidly spread the love by victor bhoroma the recent public notice by the zimbabwe revenue authority zimra on the payment of domestic taxes in foreign currency is nothing short of a tacit admission by the government that de dollarization has failed the affected domestic taxes include pay as you earn paye value added tax vat corporate tax capital gains tax cgt and mining royalties the notice adds to the promulgated statutory instrument si 252a of 2018 which provides for the payment of customs and excise duty for selected goods in foreign currencies other than the local zimbabwean dollar the list of the selected goods is quite extensive and includes motor vehicles leather products cigarettes and a host of agricultural products among others the notice by zimra came in the same week that the monetary policy committee mpc indexed minimum capital requirements for local banks in united states dollars it also follows the supreme court of zimbabwe s landmark ruling which declared that all debts incurred in united states dollars on or before 22 february 2019 are payable in the local currency at the rate of 1 1 if the current interbank rate is used the ruling means that the taxman will now be paid less than us 261 million for tax arrears amounting to over us 4 5 billion as of december 2018 the ruling also means that the government will in effect pay about us 550 million for domestic debts that amounted to over us 9 5 billion in december 2018 the court ruling clears any confusion that may arise with us dollar debts that will be incurred in future and implicitly lays the foundation for efforts to re dollarize the economy directly or indirectly via foreign currency trading exemptions beyond the zimra notice the market was made to believe that si 142 of 2019 which banned trading in foreign currency was the law under section 2 of si 142 of 2019 it is stated that the british pound euro united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe the section further says accordingly the zimbabwe dollar shall with effect from the 24th june 2019 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions however the zimra notice means that producers can now freely trade either in local currency foreign currencies or both provided they pay the government in the currency of trading the notice further provides the account numbers for onward tax remittances implying that tax payers will simply need to deposit what is due to the taxman without any questions being asked soon after the promulgation of si 142 of 2019 the government made exemptions to local petroleum marketing companies chrome miners non governmental organizations ngos embassies and multinational corporations operating locally to use foreign currencies for local transactions through their foreign currency accounts fcas the hospitality industry including fast food restaurants the national railways of zimbabwe nrz and mining sector later followed on the central bank exemptions list it is not the first time that foreign currency trading exemptions have been used in the local market back in september 2008 the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz tacitly admitted to the damage caused by the hyperinflation 250 million percent in july 2008 by licensing various local producers in the market under the foreign currency licensed warehouses and shops foliwars the exemption initially applied to about 1000 shops but it later exempted almost all local manufacturers and telecommunications companies the market has accepted that the pharmaceutical producers and retailers can openly trade in foreign currency just as much as it is done in victoria falls kariba bulawayo and beitbridge sensing inflation inspired losses in using the zimbabwean dollar the small to medium enterprises smes and the informal sector began re dollarizing as far back as august 2019 when inflation eclipsed 289 with the influence wielded by the informal sector in the zimbabwean economy it was only a matter of time it can however be argued that the us dollar never left the local market despite spirited efforts by the government to criminalize its use through various legislations it is evident that the local market including the government itself has no trust in the zimbabwean dollar and the economy is justifiably re dollarizing in the face of hyperinflation and low confidence in government policies the prices that prevail in the local market are simply us dollar prices that are simply converted to local unit using the parallel market rate in order to evade persecution by law enforcement agents otherwise the market is partially dollarized these zim dollar prices change constantly with the movements on the parallel market piling more pressure to local producers to adopt a currency which brings stability and certainty the rushed introduction of the zimbabwean dollar in june 2019 before addressing key macroeconomic fundamentals and instituting governance reforms has been nothing short of a disaster for the zimbabwean economy erosion of incomes for labour and commerce have been complemented by billions of losses in us dollar for pension funds and the zimbabwe stock exchange zse market the reality of stagflation has finally dawned on the government with inflation rate over 521 economic contraction of over 6 5 in 2019 and unemployment rate of over 95 policy options are far and wide increasing money supply to boost economic growth will lead to spiraling inflation income erosion and decline in aggregate demand while the partially implemented austerity reforms of 2019 meant decline in production in the absence of a stable currency zimbabwe has walked the dollarization path before and the wave is now so powerful that government will find it difficult to ignore whilst it struggles to meet its mandate of providing public services to the citizens the adoption of the us dollar in 2009 left the central bank s money printing machinery redundant but it stabilized the economy and tamed the scourge of hyperinflation largely caused by excessive money printing to fund quasi fiscal activities and budget deficits dollarization allowed zimbabwe to eliminate exchange rate risks build real savings boost lending rates improve the investment climate resume financial intermediation reduce transaction costs in trade and retool production through accessing foreign lines of credit the local currency has failed the above in less than 6 months the notice by zimra may give the restive civil service a legitimate reason to ask for remuneration in foreign currency considering the tax collector also feels that payment of domestic taxes in a battered local currency does not equate to being paid in a stable foreign currency partial re dollarization might be a soft admission strategy to allow the economy to gradually find its feet and avoid inevitable contraction in 2020 after all dollarization in 2008 was championed by the market with the government succumbing when it was inevitable in 2020 the market is leading the government as has been the case in countries that dollarized before zimbabwe such as cambodia venezuela argentina bolivia peru el salvador chile and georgia dollarization may also be an easier pill to swallow temporarily than implementing economic social and political reforms that are critical in bringing sustainable economic development these reforms include guarantees to property rights including finalizing land tenure issues rule of law good governance and political stability curbing corruption cutting runaway government expenditure by simply spending below tax revenues and improving the business climate locally despite the tacit admission the market hopes that the government has got a plan to significantly increase local production tackle sovereign debt issues unlock investment through improving investor confidence and build foreign currency reserves in the event that re dollarization carries the day in 2020 victor bhoroma is a

what a difference a year makes last year ended with markets under pressure and many stock indices falling over 10 we wrote in our fourth quarter 2018 review that negative headlines about global trade concerns had probably become too pessimistic and that fundamental economic conditions were still quite strong as a result with more attractive valuations we positioned our balanced portfolios with an overweight to equities heading into 2019 fortunately we were correct with equity markets rebounding well it is quite striking how different market sentiment was at the end of 2019 compared to a year ago in some respects it s a useful reminder not to get too caught up in those headlines in the business section of the news while the us china trade war and its impact on global growth was top of mind throughout the year investors were optimistic in the fourth quarter that trade tensions would ease with a phase one agreement between the two countries growth would stabilize and central banks policy rates would remain low in the short term the canadian equity fund finished the year on a strong note and outperformed the s p tsx composite index in the fourth quarter nuvista energy 28 6 canadian natural resources 20 3 and tourmaline oil 17 1 were among the top performers in the fund as rising oil prices and an easing of global growth concerns led to a rebound in energy these stocks were all weak a year ago and we added to our positions in 2018 the u s equity fund provided a solid return in the fourth quarter but trailed the s p 500 return of 7 0 as our underweight in the top performing information technology sector continued to hurt relative results on the positive side unitedhealth group was the top performer in the portfolio up 33 0 during the fourth quarter after reporting strong earnings and sales results that beat expectations the international equity plus fund rebounded in the fourth quarter but lagged the msci eafe index return of 6 1 in another example of a change in sentiment versus a year ago the fund was helped by its holdings in the uk as the country made progress on its efforts to leave the european union most of the major equity markets across the globe provided double digit returns for the calendar year the s p 500 was the best performing market in 2019 posting a 31 5 gain in us dollars and a still impressive 25 2 return in canadian dollars both canadian and international equity markets also provided strong returns with the tsx composite up 22 9 and the msci eafe up 16 2 our equity portfolios delivered strong returns but had difficulty keeping up with the hot markets of 2019 which saw the continued dominance of several expensive technology stocks while we do own many of the more attractively priced technology companies not owning some of the high fliers such as shopify 173 5 and apple 79 5 hurt our relative results in canada and the us in addition amid falling bond yields during the year investors preferred the perceived safety of defensive and yield oriented stocks such as gold 42 5 and pipelines 34 5 areas we have no exposure to in our canadian equity funds as these businesses are overpriced relative to their growth potential while almost half of the companies we owned during the year provided returns over 20 an area of weakness during the year was companies in more economically sensitive sectors like energy and materials which lagged the indices pessimism in these areas is probably too severe just as pessimism was overdone for the broad markets in 2018 we believe these weaker areas in our funds represent good value and should contribute to outperformance in the future our patience with underperforming names is usually well rewarded as we enter a new decade and reflect on the last 10 years one might wonder whether the rally has gone on too long and if it can continue we would first note that it hasn t been a smooth ride this bull market has had its normal share of hiccups including the european debt crisis of 2010 11 the commodity price crash of 2014 15 and more recently global trade uncertainty in 2018 canadian and international markets are up between 7 and 8 per annum over the last decade which are respectable results but not excessive when compared to bond returns of over 4 us markets are the standout performer up over 16 but our value portfolio is positioned differently to the s p500 while we agree that no asset classes are cheap we are still finding value selectively in fixed income markets canadian government bond yields rose steadily during the quarter due to a combination of both rising real yields suggesting a more positive outlook for growth combined with a recovery in long term inflation expectations from previously depressed levels as a result our core bond fund declined modestly in the fourth quarter however bond returns for the full 2019 year were strong as accommodative central bank policy pushed bond yields lower for most of the year in our balanced fund we have been maintaining our neutral asset mix position neither overweight nor underweight equities as valuations overall are reasonable across our equity portfolios we remain focused on business fundamentals owning companies that we expect will weather any future economic storms which will inevitably occur although we cannot predict when canadian equity fund canadian equity markets finished the year with a solid fourth quarter of performance as us china trade tensions moderated and investors became somewhat more optimistic that global growth would stabilize the s p tsx composite tsx was up 3 2 in the quarter led by the outperformance of four sectors information technology 10 8 was the top performing sector helped by the 25 2 increase in shopify the improved trade outlook helped the more economically sensitive sectors of energy 7 1 and industrials 5 2 to outperform the materials sector was up 7 8 with gold 8 4 and silver 21 2 stocks continuing to perform well despite economic sentiment turning more positive on the other hand rising bond yields led to a rotation out of real estate 2 4 and consumer staples 3 9 health care 5 9 was once again the worst performing sector as cannabis stocks extended their losses into the fourth quarter the canadian equity fund outperformed the tsx during the fourth quarter returning 4 1 after fees and expenses due to a rebound in its energy holdings as well as notably strong performance from cineplex in communication services no exposure to the health care sector was also a positive conversely performance was hurt by having no exposure to gold and silver stocks as well as not owning shopify in the energy sector oil and gas producers rebounded in the fourth quarter with the 13 rise in oil prices and the improvement in canadian natural gas prices nuvista energy 28 6 canadian natural resources 20 3 and tourmaline oil 17 1 were among the top performers in the fund these companies continue to perform well operationally generating strong free cash flow we added to our positions in all three names in early october these shares are still attractively valued one of the weaker performers in the portfolio was uranium producer cameco ccj financial which declined 7 7 as the company reported below expectation sales volumes the commodity price environment remains challenging given slower reactor restarts and elevated global inventories impacting the supply and demand outlook we trimmed our position over the fourth quarter in favour of more attractive opportunities while 2019 was a very strong year for canadian equities it was also one which was difficult to keep up with due to the leadership of a few areas some of the themes mentioned above for this quarter have also been in favour over the year information technology 64 9 has been the best performing sector led by the 173 5 rise in shopify investor expectations for continued growth going forward remain very high and are reflected in shopify s expensive valuation gold stocks 42 5 have also done well this year amid economic uncertainty and falling interest rates we have not owned gold companies due to their expensive valuations and poor record of capital allocation the long term performance of the gold sub sector continues to materially lag that of the overall market the weakest area of the portfolio has been the oil and gas producers we own including tourmaline 7 7 and nuvista 21 8 while these companies and several others have rebounded in the fourth quarter it has been a challenging year as the canadian energy sector has struggled with export capacity and political and regulatory uncertainty in addition to falling commodity prices earlier in the year many energy companies we hold have moderated spending in this environment and have been using excess cash flow to pay down debt with solid management teams and balance sheets in good shape our holdings continue to represent good value which we believe will be rewarded over the long term on a positive note many companies in the portfolio have provided strong double digit returns for the year ia financial tsx iag financial is the top performer in the fund increasing 69 0 as it reported several quarters of strong financial results and recently announced the acquisition of us vehicle warranty provider ias which will expand the company s existing warranty operations and provide opportunities for earnings accretion recreational vehicle manufacturer brp 68 8 also provided impressive returns for the year the company continues to show strong product and dealer momentum which has driven revenue growth other companies that were up significantly in the year include cineplex 56 0 constellation software 48 5 and brookfield asset management 45 3 with the strength in equities we have generally been trimming companies that have performed well and seen returns narrow as always we remain disciplined and focused on our approach investing in established businesses trading at attractive valuations which we expect will deliver value for clients over the long term canadian dividend fund similar to the canadian equity fund the canadian dividend fund outperformed the tsx during the fourth quarter returning 3 3 after fees and expenses in the energy sector oil and gas producers rebounded in the fourth quarter with the 13 rise in oil prices and the improvement in canadian natural gas prices canadian natural resources cnq financial was up 20 3 as it continues to perform well operationally and is generating strong free cash flow that is being used to pay down debt and repurchase shares improved economic sentiment over the quarter helped caterpillar dealers toromont industries 10 7 and finning international 10 0 toromont reported solid third quarter results helped by strong equipment sales and improved operating results at its refrigeration business cimco on the weaker side canadian tire tsx ctc a financial declined 5 3 in the fourth quarter the company announced good financial results with positive same store sales growth of 2 7 increased its dividend and rolled out a new operational efficiency program that will target over 200 million in annualized savings by 2022 however shares fell in december following a report released by a us short seller we believe canadian tire will continue to experience healthy sales growth going forward given its efforts to expand e commerce and its position as a retailer of choice in seasonal goods not typically purchased online shovels lawnmowers etc in the real estate sector first capital was down 6 0 despite releasing solid results completing a reit conversion and detailing plans to capitalize on significant development opportunities within the portfolio on a positive note many companies in the portfolio have provided strong double digit returns for the year companies that were up significantly in the year include cineplex 52 5 constellation software 48 5 brookfield asset management 45 3 ct reit 44 4 and brookfield infrastructure 43 8 with the strength in equities we have generally been trimming companies that have performed well and seen returns narrow for example over the year we have trimmed fund holdings of brookfield asset management brookfield infrastructure and constellation software we have used the proceeds to add selectively to companies where we see attractive value earlier in the year we added new holdings in sleep country and cineplex as investors became too pessimistic on the outlook for these businesses for cineplex its value was realized a lot quicker than we expected with the recent acquisition announcement us equity fund returns on us equities were again positive during the quarter the s p 500 index the index increased 7 0 in the fourth quarter in canadian dollar terms and over 25 in 2019 the us equity fund performed well returning 4 8 after fees and expenses during the quarter but underperformed the index primarily due to security selection and an underweight in the outperforming information technology sector portfolio holdings in the financials sector were contributors to underperformance on the positive side security selection in real estate and an underweight to consumer staples contributed positively to returns general electric ge financial was a positive contributor during the quarter as the company continued to make progress on growing its aviation business stabilizing its gas powered turbine business and deleveraging their balance sheet while shares advanced strongly over the quarter and year we believe that there is considerable upside remaining other positive contributors to performance included royal caribbean cruises and mgm resorts international the largest detractor to performance in the quarter was spirit aerosystems holdings spr financial an aerostructure manufacturer providing fuselage wings and engine housings its major customers are boeing and airbus smaller plane original equipment manufacturers and defense contractors the company has been impacted by the grounding of the boeing 737 max making up a large component of the company s revenue and earnings we have stress tested different scenarios and believe that spirit is cheap under most production rate scenarios another detractor from performance was coca cola european partners ccep which reported flat revenues and shares underperformed on forward commentary us dividend fund usd the us dividend fund advanced by 5 8 in us dollars during the fourth quarter fund performance was helped by holdings in general electric united health group and cvs corp detractors from performance included new york community bancorp dupont de nemours inc and exelon corp us small mid cap equity fund us small mid cap equities rallied in the fourth quarter with the russell 2500 index the index delivering a strong return of 6 4 8 5 in usd terms led by health care 15 9 information technology 8 7 and energy 6 4 sectors utilities were the only sector finishing the quarter with a loss 4 0 the us small mid cap fund returned 3 5 after fees and expenses during the fourth quarter the relative underperformance was mainly attributable to having limited exposure to the top performing sectors noted above and a couple of stock specific issues over the fourth quarter cinemark holdings cnk financial 13 3 a suburban focused movie theatre business with operations in the us and south america was the weakest performer the company s third quarter results were weak as a result of higher big box film concentration and consequently lower film gross margins however these kinds of quarterly fluctuations are common in this business on the positive side domestic concession per ticket continues to improve we feel that today s discounted share price more than compensates us for this risk shares of middleby midd financial a leading foodservice equipment manufacturer declined 8 2 over the fourth quarter as investors concern over the near term weaker demand environment continued in response the company has been focusing its efforts on improving cost efficiency including facility consolidations sales of non core assets and working to better lever their scale advantages one of the top contributors over the fourth quarter was wyndham hotels resorts wh financial 19 5 a hotel franchisor with 20 hotel brands worldwide its franchise retention rate is at peak levels and expectations of its net new hotel growth rate has improved in addition the company has continued to buy back undervalued shares throughout the year for the full 2019 year the us small mid cap fund delivered a strong gain of 23 9 after fees and expenses outperforming the index return of 21 6 due to strong stock selection across various sectors nearly three quarters of the portfolio outperformed the index with a number of companies delivering stellar returns of over 50 tetra tech 59 3 keysight technologies 57 0 carlisle 54 9 and air lease 51 4 international equity plus fund the international equity plus fund returned 4 6 after fees and expenses during the fourth quarter lagging the msci eafe index which returned 6 1 in the same period the fund has been positioned defensively throughout 2019 as the market rallied defensive areas such as telecoms underperformed while energy stocks were broadly flat the most significant detractor to performance was nokia which warned on its 2020 outlook and suspended the dividend financial stocks rallied as yield curves steepened and health care stocks recovered ground on continued positive operating results the country weightings of the international equity plus fund at december 31 2019 were emerging markets equity fund the emerging markets fund had a strong quarter returning 11 6 after fees and expenses outperforming the msci emerging markets index which returned 9 7 investors had punished emerging market stocks in previous quarters given the trade war between the u s and china slowing chinese growth and a strong u s dollar but this created opportunities to enter in or add to positions at attractive prices the fund remains focused on investing in inexpensive companies whose fundamentals should improve return since inception remains strong against both broad and value indices balanced fund the balanced fund advanced by 2 3 after fees and expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 the asset mix for the fund at december 31 2019 was income advantage fund the income advantage fund advanced by 2 0 after fees and expenses in the fourth quarter the fund s preferred share holdings led performance followed by strong positive contributions from the canadian dividend equity holdings and fixed income holdings both investment grade and sub investment grade the asset mix for the income advantage fund at december 31 2019 was core bond fund following four consecutive quarters of strong returns the fourth quarter of 2019 saw slightly negative bond returns primarily due to the rise in government bond yields returns for the full 2019 calendar year however remain near 8 for core bond strategies the core bond fund declined by 0 9 during the quarter slightly lagging the ftse canada universe bond index during the quarter which declined by 0 7 fund performance was helped by to a combination of overweight allocation to short dated corporate bonds that provide additional yield and interest rate curve strategies that outperformed the benchmark the bank of canada left the overnight policy rate unchanged during the quarter with expectations rising for the central bank to leave policy rates unchanged through 2020 although there are many uncertainties on the horizon inflation remains broadly in line with target and more recent economic data has suggested that growth has stabilized and the economy remains resilient with a strong labour market rising wages and re emerging strength in the canadian housing market in addition global trade frictions appear to be easing with both the usmca close to ratification and a thawing of us china relations credit spreads tightened markedly into the end of the year due to renewed optimism on trade low interest rates and a stabilization in global economic growth both corporate and provincial credit spreads are now at or near the smallest levels seen in 2019 and in some cases at the smallest levels in several years the core bond fund remains overweight corporate bonds with an overall portfolio yield modestly higher than the ftse canada universe bond index these corporate bond holdings are biased towards high quality issues with maturities that are shorter than the index which generates additional yield for the fund without exposing the portfolio to undue credit risk furthermore the fund remained underweight provincial bonds during the quarter when provincial bond spreads significantly underperformed corporate credit although considerable uncertainty remains we are more optimistic than in prior quarters for several reasons firstly the near ratification of usmca combined with a thawing in us china trade tensions should provide a material boost to sentiment in the future and this could in turn help to boost capital investment which has been the laggard compared to other areas of the economy secondly a combination of low interest rates buoyant capital markets and growing fiscal stimulus either heading into a us election or from a reversal in european fiscal austerity could provide additional support to growth and further extend the already record breaking length of the existing recovery we see limited signs of the excesses in credit or inflation that have in the past been the catalyst for such recoveries to end abruptly thirdly we believe that recent indicators suggest that the economic weakness experienced in 2018 and early 2019 was limited to a modest slowdown and is not the forerunner for a recession the us and canada remain near full employment real wages are rising asset markets stocks credit housing are all strong and interest rates remain low for the foreseeable future finally the us federal reserve has signalled that they are likely done cutting rates in the short term and the bank of canada continues to indicate that they believe current monetary policy is appropriate particularly with inflation close to target corporate advantage fund the corporate advantage fund advanced by 0 9 after fees and expenses during the fourth quarter the largest contributor to performance was the fund s holdings preferred shares followed by its investment grade and high yield bond holdings the asset mix of the corporate advantage fund at december 31 2019 was high yield bond fund sub investment grade fixed income returned another positive quarter as equity markets rallied and high yield credit spreads declined optimism over a phase one trade deal between the united states and china and continued dovishness by the federal reserve contributed to u s treasury yields rebounding off multiyear lows reached in the third quarter risk on sentiment in the fourth quarter saw lower quality bonds outperform a reversal to prior quarters in which investors preferred higher quality credit the high yield bond fund returned 1 3 and the currency hedged series of the fund advanced by 3 0 both after fees and expenses during the quarter fund performance was helped by two energy holdings talen energy 7 8 and gulfport energy 10 2 oil refiner and energy distributor par pacific 6 3 and superior plus 4 6 also contributed to positive returns in the quarter the main detractor from performance during the quarter was office use headphone company plantronics 7 6 resulting from falling revenue due to trade tensions and integration issues while the bonds offer good relative value to other single b names a decline in their equity led to their debt ratios looking more like a low b rated entity with no near term positive catalysts we fully exited the position in november the fund is defensively positioned by holding bonds with shorter term to maturity as the compensation to hold longer dated bonds remain low we continue to be positive on sub investment grade fixed income as forward expectation of default rates are low and credit spreads remain stable our expectation continues to be that future returns will be generated primarily through high coupon income multi credit fund the multi credit fund returned 2 7 after fees and expenses during the quarter helped by its high yield bond holdings which outperformed senior secured loans over the quarter factors that impacted the high yield bond

in june 2016 a narrow majority of british citizens voted to leave the european union beginning three and a half years of intense political and economic certainty no one knew for sure when or how the uk would leave the body that had shaped its economy for the previous 43 years it was easy to see how this confusion would cause instability in britain s financial sector and a loss of confidence in the uk s economic prospects but public confidence in the uk has remained relatively high and financial market volatility muted a major factor behind this relative calm were robust preparations undertaken by the bank of england led by its governor mark carney he held office at one of the most potentially fraught periods in the uk s recent history but this was only one of carney s achievements at the boe under his leadership the central bank continued with a successful quantitative easing programme and greatly expanded its supervisory and regulatory activities in the aftermath of the global financial crisis carney himself has been a key figure in pushing central banks to take effective action to deal with environmental risks the uk central bank started making detailed plans to ensure the country s banking system would be able to sustain a worst case scenario brexit shock since before the referendum result the work was carried out largely behind closed doors by the bank s financial policy committee the body set up in 2013 to protect and enhance the resilience of the uk financial system the uk government subsequently announced three dates for leaving the european union before eventually leaving on january 31 2020 with a temporary withdrawal agreement in place each time there was a real possibility that the uk could leave the eu on trade terms set by the world trade organization potentially causing significant economic damage yet uk banks suffered no noticeable seizing up of funding part of the reason for this relative stability although not fully tested by a hard brexit was due to the fpc developing a worst case no deal no transition brexit scenario to stress test banks to ensure they would have sufficient capital to remain fully operational the initial scenario included a peak to trough decline to gdp of 8 in absolute terms a rise in unemployment to 7 5 and inflation at 6 5 the scenario became less onerous in 2019 as government preparations for a potential hard brexit improved the bank of england also introduced auctions and set up a sterling euro swap line with the european central bank in the lead up to march 28 the original exit date to ensure banks had access to sufficient funding in the event of market disturbance carney and ecb president mario draghi teamed up to lead a working group tasked with managing the risks to financial services from brexit the boe made concerted efforts to address potential disruption risks with its supervisory counterparts in the eu including contingencies for the multi trillion dollar derivatives market notably in mutual clearing recognition alongside these well executed technical preparations another factor that helped to maintain confidence in the broader uk financial system was carney s decision to extend his term as governor first to june 2019 then until january 31 2020 the actual brexit date and finally to march 15 this year this was to ensure an orderly transition according to uk chancellor sajid javid to carney s successor and boe alumnus andrew bailey three successive uk chancellors have recognised carney s importance for uk financial and monetary stability philip hammond who held the role for most of the post referendum period wrote to carney in september 2018 stressing his need to stay on as governor to support a smooth exit during an exceptional period personal attacks carney was publicly supported by the successive conservative governments led by prime ministers cameron may and johnson but some conservative politicians including jacob rees mogg who became leader of the house of commons and iain duncan smith the former party leader attacked carney as a ringleader of establishment efforts to scare the public from leaving the eu an effort dubbed project fear this criticism appears to be misplaced carney has frequently been asked by lawmakers for his and the bank s professional assessment of the economic and financial consequences of certain possible brexit outcomes and he has replied he has then been criticised for replying carney has repeatedly defended his actions saying that while the boe expected a brexit deal would be secured there was a significant risk there would be no trade or withdrawal agreement ultimately carney and the boe s job of developing realistic brexit scenarios has been made far more difficult because of lawmakers being vague and inconsistent in their own predictions of the likely outcome of brexit discussions developing sound policy response to this level of uncertainty was a challenging task many participants in the brexit debate did not want to hear unwelcome truths but the governor of the bank of england did not have the option to keep quiet institutional capacity that carney s team was able to chart a course through such an uncertain environment to prepare the uk financial system against brexit shocks was in part due to the creation of an institutional framework that allows policymakers to better understand and manage risks the monetary policy committee the prudential regulation authority and the fpc can now work together where necessary to ensure joined up oversight this was highlighted by the formation of worst case brexit scenario stress tests which involved the micro and macro prudential authorities working together another benefit of joined up oversight is that there is less likelihood of making policy mistakes due to misdiagnosis for example by understanding that unusually low mortgage spreads were the result of the implementation of the uk s new ring fencing regime carney has also overseen significant efforts to tackle the risks posed by too big to fail including the resolution of systemically important institutions although not completed the boe now thinks of resolvability not as binary but as a continuum carney told central banking last summer carney and the boe s job of developing realistic brexit scenarios has been made far more difficult because of lawmakers being vague and inconsistent in their own predictions of the likely outcome of brexit discussions all these efforts have led to a better prepared banking and financial system albeit that the worst case scenarios that would test the system including how the boe would manage moral hazard issues have not materialised to date the preparations have also offered new insights and the institutional structure offers greater opportunity for a more varied career at the bank helping staff retention at the same time carney has strongly supported the boe being an equal opportunities employer notably backing female appointments even if they haven t always been successful inflation on target meanwhile the uk s consumer prices index cpi inflation rate ended the year at 1 9 down from its peak of 3 1 in november 2017 and close to its 2 target it has since fallen to 1 3 although wages are rising by more than 3 the bank of england s governor must write to the chancellor in the event inflation strays more than one percentage point away from target the last exchange of letters was in february 2018 when carney said high levels of inflation were almost entirely due to the effects of higher import prices caused by the effective 16 depreciation of sterling following the vote to leave the european union the bank of england s quantitative easing effort a programme inherited by carney has also proven to be a qualified success at least when looking solely at inflation figures and when compared with the schemes run by bank of japan and the european central bank the federal reserve s policies may have proven more successful and research indicates us policy has had important spillover benefits for the uk but the fiscal environment in the us was more accommodative like the fed the boe has indicated it does not favour negative interest rates l to r mark carney with central banking s christopher jeffery while the boe s forward guidance exposed flaws in the detail its 7 unemployment threshold turned out to be way too high the broad message that rates would stay relatively low for some time was communicated but the boe learned lessons including how to better measure labour supply and as central banks around the world continue to use exceptional monetary policy measures carney said in january this year that boe economists would embark on a year long research project to examine whether the inflation targeting framework remained fit for task while he said the bar for change to the regime is very high he cautioned against complacency open minded and outspoken carney has often led the debate during the past year in the uk and internationally on important issues including improving the payments system tackling climate risks and addressing the challenges linked to us dollar funding his attitude towards fintech and climate risks two areas where central banks will place increased emphasis during the coming years has been neither unquestioningly optimistic nor aggressively obstructive when asked about disruptions to the payment system caused by the potential introduction of facebook s libra carney reminded central banking that the boe ultimately serves the people of the uk not banks or other intermediaries he said libra is shining a light on deficiencies in the payments system with domestic payments still too slow and cross border payments much worse carney added that new entrants coming up with new architecture was a good thing but high standards would remain in place for all payment providers including new entrants for something like libra which could be adopted by a huge number of people very quickly you cannot learn as you go you are either ready or you are not and if you are not ready you do not start that is increasingly appreciated so we need work with these initiatives to see if they can get ready and if they cannot what are the alternatives to solve the issue he said ultimately carney believes properly run fintech firms could access the boe s balance sheet climate of change carney was also one of the first central bankers to recognise the financial risks posed by the growing prevalence of extreme weather and the transition to a low carbon economy as early as 2015 he was navigating this new terrain in his capacity as chair of the financial stability board fsb it was also treacherous politically charged territory a turning point was a speech in september 2015 in which carney framed the issue in terms of the tragedy of the horizon the tragedy of climate change was that action needed to be taken immediately and collectively but the damage would play out over a much longer horizon beyond the political cycle the business cycle and the view of central banks carney warned we don t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix concerns about overstretching mandates were addressed by central banks slotting climate risks into the financial stability frameworks rather than in monetary policy that many had gained in the wake of the 2008 crisis an initial goal was better disclosure if it was possible to create a market to price climate transition risks capital would start flowing to well prepared businesses which would also tend to be those less reliant on fossil fuels in december 2015 the task force on climate related financial disclosures was launched under the aegis of the fsb the same month in which the paris agreement was struck momentum was building in december 2017 the central banks and supervisors network for greening the financial system ngfs formed with eight members the boe among them since then the ngfs has seen its membership swell to 54 full members and 12 observers in 2019 the boe told banks and insurers it expected them to manage climate risks saying they would be judged accordingly during the supervisory process the prudential regulation authority became the world s first regulator to publish explicit expectations for the control of climate risks since then firms have asked for more detail which the pra has committed to providing bank of england a mark of the prescience of carney s tragedy of the horizon speech is that the broad framework he outlined remains an excellent guide to the policy agenda for green finance as the boe governor told the world economic forum in january this year creating a market for climate assets remains essential as it will give investors a channel through which they can apply pressure to laggards he argued investors were ready to accelerate a green transition but said they needed the backing of governments carney will continue pressing the case when he becomes a united nations envoy on finance and climate change taking over from former new york mayor michael bloomberg when he leaves the boe in march reflecting the respect with which he is held in the uk carney has also agreed to advise prime minister johnson in the run up to a major un climate conference taking place in scotland this november dollar asymmetry in 2019 carney also used several public engagements to warn of possible risks from asymmetry at the heart of the global system investors have huge demand for safe us dollar assets but supply is rising at a much slower pace and alternative options namely the euro and renminbi remain underdeveloped that puts pressure on the dollar and links financial conditions worldwide to the fate of the greenback a sudden loss of confidence among investors could spell widespread havoc while the system has served us well the strains on that system will become increasingly apparent carney told central banking the non bank system represents around half of all global financial assets with just 13 6 held by firms in the fsb s narrow measure of the riskiest forms of non banks those subject to possible runs as of december 2018 but as carney noted in his june 2019 speech pull push pipes these firms could be potent amplification mechanisms for global liquidity flows particularly problematic are open ended funds which offer daily redemptions even where their assets are highly illiquid many of these funds are invested in emerging market bonds thereby tying local conditions in the financial sector and real economy to the vagaries of global capital flows and the animal spirits of investors again carney s high profile support helped create momentum internationally the fsb has debated many of the issues and is weighing up how it can better gauge systemic risk at the global level and the boe and financial conduct authority have begun changing uk rules requiring open ended funds to impose either a time delay or price discount on customers wanting to liquidate illiquid investments if others follow that should limit the threat of damaging runs developing speaking at a press conference in december 2019 carney said he believed the issues were increasingly recognised at a global level deputy governor jon cunliffe said the discussion had come a long way since the fsb published a set of recommendations for asset managers in 2017 carney arrived at the boe during a very difficult period the aftermath of the financial crisis he has spent the last three years coping with another trying to limit the instability that followed the brexit referendum the period has marked a fall in sterling but no widespread instability in the currency funding or other markets without the efforts of the boe under its governor mark carney this might not have been the case the central banking awards were written by christopher jeffery daniel hinge dan hardie rachael king victor mendez barreira alice shen and william towning
the coronavirus outbreak has triggered demand for safe haven assets a similar pattern has been seen with the iran crisis and may reoccur throughout 2020 five financial assets stand out in these times of trouble whether it originates in wuhan or iran financial markets always have something to worry about but the demand for safe haven assets is changing the most recent coronavirus outbreak has been grabbing the headlines since mid january and will likely last for longer despite a low attention span in the age of social media arresting the disease will probably take some time and investors will not tune out so quickly it may have a similar effect as sino american trade tensions and like those fears they come and go triggering buying and selling of such assets the new year has resulted in different trends with some assets becoming more prominent others losing some shine and some have become trickier to trade here are five top safe havens in 2020 1 gold gold has made a comeback for various reasons goldbugs that were dismayed by the downfall at prices in the middle of the decade have begun returning to the generations old precious metal moreover some of those that were wooed by cryptocurrencies have become disillusioned both assets are attractive for those fearing central bank induced inflation gold has benefited from the federal reserve s interest rate cuts in 2019 and provides ample liquidity to the repo market and while some central banks are printing money others such as in russia and china have been diversifying their portfolios into gold another factor helping the yellow metal stems from the high demand for other rare materials such as palladium and rhodium used in modern automobiles overall xau usd is enjoying an uptrend that may continue there is still a long way to go to reach a peak near 2 000 recorded in 2011 leaving substantial room to rise within the chartered territory gold continues enjoying an uptrend 2 japanese yen the japanese currency tops the list of safe haven currencies but the yen trade is crowded leaving the crown to gold nevertheless usd jpy and other yen crosses had fallen when depressing news broke out even if it related to japan the devastating earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster in fukushima in 2011 resulted in a rush to the yen despite the catastrophe for the island nation while its status has eroded since then the currency benefited from tensions around north korea and more recently iran it remains in demand also with the coronavirus 3 us bonds the us dollar is the world s reserve currency and treasury bonds still provide a high yield in comparison to other developed nations moreover america s debt market is deep and liquid allowing investors to flock into bills notes and bonds at almost any time while president donald trump s tax cuts have bloated the deficit and us debt ample liquidity provided by the fed and insatiable demand for bonds makes it the go to asset in debt markets it is essential to note that us debt is a worthy safe haven asset while the us dollar is losing its shine in 2020 similar to the yen usd demand is overcrowded moreover when investors flock into us treasuries they lower their yields making the dollar less attractive this yield dollar correlation was not that prominent in 2019 but seems to be gathering pace in 2020 4 swiss franc the small nation in the alps is home to secretive banks safety and solidity however the swiss national bank s decision to peg the value of the franc to the euro in 2011 and its chaotic abandoning of this floor in 2015 have pushed it lower in the ranks nevertheless 2020 has been positive for chf while it is not the first choice when bad news erupts it is neither sold off that quickly overall it serves as an appealing alternative to the beaten yen trade for those who prefer shying away from gold 5 german bunds lending money and expecting to receive less in return indeed that is what is happening in most of germany s yield curve the old continent s locomotive is showing only little signs of opening its purse strings to fiscal investment the combination of a shallow bond pool and high demand from the european central bank which has restarted its bond buying scheme in november amplify the need for german bunds apart from global issues such as the coronavirus the eu is grappling with brexit russian threats and political division in this changing world german bunds remain a haven nevertheless negative yields mean there is a limit to how far safe haven demand may go the interesting outcome for currency traders is the moderating effect that demand for bunds has on the euro eur usd volatility remains depressed while other assets are rocking and rolling what about bitcoin as mentioned earlier some goldbugs became bitcoin believers during the crisis around iran the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies soared however while prices remain above the end 2019 levels the coronavirus outbreak has failed to trigger a sustainable rally why sanctions hobble iran and some of its citizens have used bitcoin as a means to interact with the outside world fear of open war with the us and later the fading of these concerns pushed demand from both iranians and speculators from the outside however the novel coronavirus is not triggering substantial outflows from china at least not for now after an initial slide of the yuan it has recovered partly due to officials efforts to keep the economy stable without this kind of fear factor cryptocurrencies are not going to fly the world s second largest economy is home to many bitcoin miners and has yet to come to terms with its digital currency policy bitcoin is also tricky as a safe haven asset as its price is determined by so many other factors that are unrelated to the global mood hacks of exchanges regulation movements from altcoins to the btc hash rate whale activity and many other crypto related factors are all in the mix an increase in the value of bitcoin alongside rising global fears may therefore be coincidental and may not repeat itself bitcoin s case is more complicated conclusion the coronavirus scare is set to last for a significant period of time and when it diminishes other troubles will likely worry investors and trigger flows into safe havens gold is topping the list of havens in 2020 pushing the yen to second place us and german bonds are rising in prominence alongside the swiss franc bitcoin s status as a safe haven asset it still work in progress
opinions of tuesday 4 february 2020 columnist abdul karim mohammed awaf as the political temperature heats up to the upcoming general elections many politicians will be tempted to make grand promises in their bid to win the hearts of voters we will soon hear free this free that but what is the price of the free if you follow any international tv or radio channel a week won t pass without a news item about venezuela the country that used to be the richest country in latin america and became a global model for its meteoric economic miracles is now in tatters it is estimated that close to five million people have reportedly left venezuela since 2014 the scale of the country s economic decline can be comparable to zimbabwe s in the late 1990s the country s gdp has fallen more than 35 per cent a sharper drop than the one seen during the great depression in the us the country is spiraling into hyperinflation in 2018 the country s inflation exceeded 1 000 000 per cent since early 2018 the government of venezuela has essentially stopped producing official inflation estimates yes that s how dire the situation is this state of affairs has led to shortages of everything including food medicine and other essential commodities things have gone from bad to worse these conditions have sparked a series of unending protests since 2014 the coalition of opposition political parties backed by the us wants president nicolás maduro out their leader juan guaido has also declared himself president but how did the country with the world s largest oil reserves get here venezuela before the crisis venezuela has been blessed with oil far more than any nation on earth but the wealth from the oil failed to trickle down to the masses unsatisfied by this state of affairs lieutenant colonel hugo chavez attempted a coup in 1992 he was unsuccessful and thus was thrown into jail for two years when he came out of jail he transformed himself into the man of the masses and stood against the political establishment he contested for the presidency and won to become the president of venezuela in 1998 having assumed the reign of power chavez decided that the bulk of the profit from the country s oil should go to the masses this was opposed by the elite establishment who made frantic efforts to get him out of office through a coup this forced hugo chavez to travel to the socialist republic of cuba in 2003 on his return chavez decided to make venezuela a socilaist state he started by nationalising or giving state control to many businesses including electricity telecommunication and the oil sector luckily for him in 2004 the global oil prices began to surge oil prices increased from 27 in 2003 to 91 in 2013 hugo chavez embarked on social programmes with proceeds from the oil his social programmes included subsidising the cost of food investing in the country s education building affordable housing for the poor among many other programmes in fact within a record time hugo chavez had reduced poverty by more than half at one point venezuela even provided free heating oil for impoverished americans yes americans then out of nowhere oil prices started to go down because countries such as the us and canada began to increase their oil production since venezuela needed more money to sustain its numerous social programmes the easiest option was to print more money to meet the short to medium term demands with the hope that the tide will turn president hugo chavez died of cancer in 2013 and was succeeded by his right hand man nicolás maduro who narrowly won and was sworn in as president but oil prices continued to go down and fell as low as 41 in 2015 foreign demand for venezuela s currency bolívar to buy venezuelan oil crashed maduro was forced to print more money and cancel some of the social programmes initiated by hugo chavez his predecessor the printing of money led to high inflation and high depreciation people then began to save their money in foreign currency like the us dollar to hedge against the fast depreciation as the country s currency s value fell the cost of imported goods rose the venezuelan economy went into crisis international investors began looking elsewhere driving the value of the bolívar even lower the government responded by issuing currency controls it set a fixed exchange rate to stop the official value of the bolívar dropping against the us dollar and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolívares into us dollars the idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions this led to mass protests these protests forced a coalition of opposition political parties called the democratic unity roundtable or mud to come together and form a coalition the opposition coalition contested and won two thirds of the national assembly putting the president s rule at risk in response maduro forced out several supreme court justices and filled in with fresh judges loyal to him in march 2016 the court ruled to strip the opposition led national assembly of its powers which escalated the protest on the streets of caracas this forced the supreme court to reverse its decision but the damage had already been inflicted and the protest continued the us then issued sanctions on venezuela us sanctions mean the country could not re finance its debt leading to high and high inflation amidst these protests president nicolás maduro launched his re election bid the opposition coalition boycotted the elections but maduro won amidst accusations of irregularities and voter intimidation backed by the us the opposition leader juan guaido declared himself interim president in january this year after invoking the venezuelan constitution this has set up a power struggle that is yet to be resolved lessons for ghana ghana is not immune to the crisis in venezuela if we don t watch our expenditure and the desire by the political class to promise free things to woo voters the hard truth is that nothing is free if a politician promises you something free ask yourself who is paying for it if our politicians will continue to make hefty electoral promises with the view that we have oil revenue that will pay for such promises what become of such promises when oil prices take a nosedive the global slam down in oil prices was one of the key reasons why ghana had to run to the international monetary fund imf for help this is because ghana s economic growth has been hedged on oil since 2010 when the country became a full blown commercial oil producer ghana was not the only country that suffered when oil prices dropped oil dependent countries including giants like saudi arabia nigeria and others had to take some austerity measures to survive this is because they all had failed to diversify their economies and given the volatility of oil prices their economies suffered some shocks ghana s situation was pretty precarious because the drop in oil prices also coincided with the energy sector crisis popularly known as dumsor this drop in foreign exchange through the sale of oil forced up inflation and led to high depreciation of the cedi leading to the cedi recording one of its highest depreciation in recent history as the country is gearing up for the 2020 elections our politicians should not be carried away by the desire to win power to the extent of forgetting about how and where they will get money to finance their campaign pledges we should realise that oil is a finite resource and we do not also control its prices as a country have we thought about how we are going to sustain the social programmes that are funded by our oil resources when we deplete our oil reserves so dear mr politician what is the price of your free promises writer abdul karim mohammed awaf social commentator abdulkarimmohammedawaf gmail com

shareholders from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to net investment gains of 1 6 billion in 2019 compared to net investment losses of 437 6 million in 2018 we also experienced an increase in net unrealized gains on available for sale investments net of taxes of 298 0 million in 2019 compared to a decrease in net unrealized gains on available for sale investments net of taxes of 233 5 million

consolidated combined ratio was 94 in 2019 compared to 98 in 2018 the decrease in the consolidated combined ratio was attributable to lower catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018 underwriting

catastrophes were net of ceded losses of 62 5 million and 244 1 million respectively both the gross and net losses on the 2019 and 2018 catastrophes as of december 31 2019 represent our best estimates based upon information currently available our estimates for these losses are based on claims received to date detailed policy and reinsurance contract level reviews industry loss estimates and output from both industry and proprietary models for the 2019 catastrophes these estimates are still dependent on broad assumptions about coverage liability and reinsurance while we believe our reserves for the 2019 and 2018 catastrophes as of december 31 2019 are adequate we continue to closely monitor reported claims and will adjust our estimates of gross and net losses as new information becomes available the net losses and loss adjustment expenses for the 2019 and 2018 catastrophes were within our risk tolerance for events of this magnitude insurance segment the combined ratio for the insurance segment in 2019 was 93 compared to 94 including three points for the underwriting loss on the 2018 catastrophes in 2018 the decrease in the combined ratio was driven by lower catastrophe losses in 2019 compared to 2018 which was largely offset by a less favorable prior accident years loss ratio higher earned premiums in 2019 had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on the prior years loss ratio the expense ratio decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the favorable impact of higher earned premiums in 2019 compared to 2018 partially offset by higher variable expenses higher variable expenses were largely driven by a lower benefit from ceding commissions in 2019 compared to 2018 due to recent changes in our outwards reinsurance treaty structures in late 2018 we shifted from buying proportional reinsurance coverages towards excess of loss coverages for our general liability and professional liability product lines the insurance segment s 2019 combined ratio included 462 1 million of favorable development on prior years loss reserves compared to 502 3 million in 2018 the decrease in favorable development was primarily due to less favorable development on our marine and energy product lines in 2019 compared to 2018 and adverse development on our property product lines in 2019 compared to favorable development in 2018 these unfavorable changes were partially offset by more favorable development on our general liability product lines in 2019 compared to 2018 the adverse development on our property product lines in 2019 was due to adverse development on our brokerage property product lines resulting from higher than expected attritional losses as well as modest adverse development on prior year catastrophes in both 2019 and 2018 favorable development was most significant on our general liability workers compensation professional liability and marine and energy product lines reinsurance segment the combined ratio for the reinsurance segment in 2019 was 104 including 10 points for the underwriting loss on the 2019 catastrophes compared to 113 including 19 points for the underwriting loss on the 2018 catastrophes in 2018 the decrease in the combined ratio was primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses as well as more favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves in 2019 compared to 2018 excluding the impact of the 2019 and 2018 catastrophes the current accident year loss ratio increased due to higher attritional losses on our property product lines arising from recent changes in our outwards property reinsurance treaty structures in 2019 we eliminated our proportional property reinsurance treaty and purchased additional excess of loss property and catastrophe reinsurance coverage we also experienced higher attritional losses across most of our other product lines in 2019 compared to 2018 these unfavorable impacts on the current accident year loss ratio in 2019 were partially offset by net favorable premium adjustments in 2019 primarily on our professional liability product lines compared to net unfavorable premium adjustments 2018 the reinsurance segment s 2019 combined ratio included 64 8 million of favorable development on prior years loss reserves compared to 43 0 million in 2018 the increase in favorable development was primarily due to more favorable development on our property product lines in 2019 compared to 2018 which included favorable development on prior year catastrophes in 2019 compared to adverse development on prior year catastrophes in 2018 we also experienced favorable development on our general liability product lines in 2019 compared to adverse development in 2018 these favorable changes were partially offset by less favorable development on our credit and surety product lines in 2019 compared to 2018 in 2019 favorable development was most significant on our property and whole account product lines in 2018 favorable development was most significant on our credit and surety and marine and energy product lines which was partially offset by adverse development on our professional liability product lines premiums and

reinsurance segments also impacting consolidated gross premium volume were gross premiums written from our program services business and other fronting arrangements which increased 14 in 2019 substantially all gross premiums from our program services business and other fronting arrangements were ceded to third parties in 2019 and 2018 gross premium volume in our insurance segment increased 12 in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was primarily driven by growth within our general liability professional liability and personal lines product lines gross premium volume in our reinsurance segment increased 6 in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was driven by higher gross premiums within our general liability product lines primarily due to a favorable impact from the timing of renewals higher premium volume within our workers compensation product line and favorable premium adjustments on our professional liability product lines these increases were partially offset by lower gross premiums in our property product lines primarily due to non renewals significant variability in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to individually significant contracts and multi year contracts net retention net retention of gross premium volume for our underwriting operations was 84 in 2019 and 83 in 2018 the increase in net retention in 2019 was driven by an increase in net retention in our insurance segment resulting from recent changes in our outwards reinsurance treaty structures in late 2018 we shifted from buying proportional reinsurance coverages towards excess of loss coverages for our general liability and professional liability product lines which resulted in higher retentions these increases in net retention were partially offset by lower retention on our personal lines product lines within our underwriting operations we purchase reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance in order to manage our net retention on individual risks and overall exposure to losses and enable us to write policies with sufficient limits to meet policyholder needs earned premiums earned premiums for 2019 increased 7 compared to 2018 the increase in earned premiums was attributable to an increase in earned premiums in our insurance segment partially offset by a decrease in our reinsurance segment the increase in earned premiums in our insurance segment was primarily due to the increase in gross premium volume within our general liability and professional liability product lines as described above the decrease in earned premiums in our reinsurance segment was primarily driven by the non renewal of two large specialty quota share treaties and lower premium volume in our property product lines as described above these decreases were partially offset by an increase in gross premium volume within our workers compensation and professional liability product lines as described above investing results net investment gains for 2019 were 1 6 billion compared to net investment losses of 437 6 million in 2018 net investment gains in 2019 were attributable to an increase in the fair value of equity securities in 2019 which was driven by favorable market value movements net investment losses in 2018 were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of equity securities in 2018 which was driven by unfavorable market value movements and a 124 6 million decline in the fair value of our investments in insurance linked securities funds ils funds due to the impact of adverse development on catastrophes that occurred in 2017

markel ventures operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 driven by higher revenues in our products businesses primarily due to the contribution of revenues from brahmin which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was also attributable to higher sales volumes and selling prices at our transportation related businesses and growth within one of our consulting services businesses these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes at one of our equipment manufacturing businesses operating income and ebitda from our markel ventures operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due in part to 33 5 million of expenses incurred in 2018 related to an investigation and remediation accrual associated with the manufacture of products at one of our businesses and an impairment charge of 14 9 million related to intangible assets at this reporting unit in 2018 excluding these charges the increase in operating income and ebitda in 2019 was primarily attributable to improved operating results at one of our consumer and building products businesses higher revenues from our transportation related businesses as described above and the contribution of a full year of operations at brahmin partially offset by the impact of lower revenues at one of our equipment manufacturing businesses as described above and losses in 2019 related to the disposition of certain components of one of our equipment manufacturing businesses net income to shareholders from our markel ventures operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher

the increase in operating revenues in our insurance linked securities operations in 2019 compared to 2018 reflects the full year contribution of revenues from nephila holdings ltd nephila in 2019 which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018 the contribution of revenues from nephila was partially offset by lower revenues from markel catco investment management ltd markel catco due to lower assets under management during 2019 compared to 2018 and a reduction in management fees charged on sidepocket shares the increase in operating expenses in our insurance linked securities operations in 2019 compared to 2018 is attributable to a full year of operating expenses for nephila in 2019 the impact of the reversal of accrued incentive and retention compensation for two former markel catco senior executives totaling 34 9 million in 2018 which was reflected as a reduction to services and other expenses in 2018 additionally 2019 included costs associated with the internal review of matters at our markel catco operations as previously reported and related litigation costs these increases were partially offset by the impact of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets at the markel catco reporting unit in 2018 program services operating revenues in our program services operations increased 14 compared to 2018 due to higher premium volume operating expenses in our program services operations decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher acquisition related expenses in 2018 interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense was 171 7 million in 2019 compared to 154 2 million in 2018 the increase in interest expense in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a 565 2 million net increase in principal outstanding on our senior long term debt during 2019 interest expense in 2019 included interest expense associated with our 5 0 unsecured senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2019 and our 3 35 and 4 15 unsecured senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2019 these increases were partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of our 7 125 unsecured senior notes in the third quarter of 2019 as well as the purchase and redemption of our 6 25 and 5 35 unsecured senior notes in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in september 2019 we purchased 125 2 million of principal on our 6 25 unsecured senior notes due september 30 2020 and 97 8 million of principal on our 5 35 unsecured senior notes due june 1 2021 through a tender offer at a total purchase price of 130 1 million and 103 0 million respectively in october 2019 we redeemed the remaining outstanding balance of 224 8 million on our 6 25 unsecured senior notes due september 30 2020 and 152 2 million on our 5 35 unsecured senior notes due june 1 2021 for a total purchase price of 233 4 million and 160 2 million respectively in connection with the september 2019 tender offer and purchase and the october 2019 redemption we recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt of 17 6 million during 2019 income taxes the effective tax rate for 2019 was 21 the effective tax rate for 2018 was not meaningful due to a small pre tax loss for the year and a one time deferred tax charge described below in 2018 we decided to elect to treat our two most significant united kingdom subsidiaries as domestic corporations for u s tax purposes as a result the earnings and profits from those subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested and during 2018 we recorded a one time deferred tax charge of 103 3 million related to the book and tax basis differences attributable to those subsidiaries in addition to this one time deferred tax charge our effective tax rate in 2018 differed from the statutory rate of 21 primarily as a result of nondeductible losses on our investments in the ils funds in 2018 partially offset by the impact of tax exempt investment income financial condition investments cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents invested assets were 22 3 billion at december 31 2019 compared to 19 2 billion at december 31 2018 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity securities driven by favorable market value movements equity securities comprised 34 of invested assets at december 31 2019 compared to 30 of invested assets at december 31 2018 at december 31 2019 our holding company held 4 0 billion of invested assets compared to 2 6 billion of invested assets at december 31 2018 the increase in holding company invested assets is primarily due to the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured senior notes in 2019

many forecast changing conditions in the oceans and atmosphere result in increased hurricane flood drought or other adverse weather related activity we offer insurance and reinsurance coverage against terrorist acts in connection with some of our programs and in other instances we are legally required to offer terrorism insurance in both circumstances we actively manage our exposure but if there is a covered terrorist attack we could sustain material losses emerging claim and coverage issues changing legal and social trends and inherent uncertainties in the loss estimation process can adversely impact the adequacy of our loss reserves and our allowance for reinsurance recoverables reinsurance reserves are subject to greater uncertainty than insurance reserves primarily because of reliance upon the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies and the longer lapse of time from the occurrence of loss events to their reporting to the reinsurer for ultimate resolution changes in the assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves for our life and annuity reinsurance book which is in runoff for example changes in assumptions and estimates of mortality longevity morbidity and interest rates could result in material increases in our estimated loss reserves for such business adverse developments in insurance coverage litigation or other legal or administrative proceedings could result in material increases in our estimates of loss reserves initial estimates for catastrophe losses are often based on limited information are dependent on broad assumptions about the nature and extent of losses coverage liability and reinsurance and those losses may ultimately differ materially from our expectations changes in the availability costs and quality of reinsurance coverage which may impact our ability to write or continue to write certain lines of business the ability or willingness of reinsurers to pay balances due may be adversely affected by industry and economic conditions deterioration in reinsurer credit quality and coverage disputes and collateral we hold if any may not be sufficient to cover a reinsurer s obligation to us after the

economic growth inflation or deflation fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates commodity and energy prices and interest rates volatility in the credit and capital markets and other factors economic conditions actual or potential defaults in municipal bonds or sovereign debt obligations volatility in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in market value of concentrated investments can have a significant impact on the fair value of our fixed maturity and equity securities as well as the carrying value of our other assets and liabilities and this impact may be heightened by market volatility economic conditions may adversely affect our access to capital and credit markets the effects of government intervention including material changes in the monetary

logos of some political parties in ghana as the political temperature heats up to the upcoming general elections many politicians will be tempted to make grand promises in their bid to win the hearts of voters we will soon hear free this free that but what is the price of the free if you follow any international tv or radio channel a week won t pass without a news item about venezuela the country that used to be the richest country in latin america and became a global model for its meteoric economic miracles is now in tatters it is estimated that close to five million people have reportedly left venezuela since 2014 the scale of the country s economic decline can be comparable to zimbabwe s in the late 1990s the country s gdp has fallen more than 35 per cent a sharper drop than the one seen during the great depression in the us the country is spiraling into hyperinflation in 2018 the country s inflation exceeded 1 000 000 per cent since early 2018 the government of venezuela has essentially stopped producing official inflation estimates yes that s how dire the situation is this state of affairs has led to shortages of everything including food medicine and other essential commodities things have gone from bad to worse these conditions have sparked a series of unending protests since 2014 the coalition of opposition political parties backed by the us wants president nicolás maduro out their leader juan guaido has also declared himself president but how did the country with the world s largest oil reserves get here venezuela before the crisis venezuela has been blessed with oil far more than any nation on earth but the wealth from the oil failed to trickle down to the masses unsatisfied by this state of affairs lieutenant colonel hugo chavez attempted a coup in 1992 he was unsuccessful and thus was thrown into jail for two years when he came out of jail he transformed himself into the man of the masses and stood against the political establishment he contested for the presidency and won to become the president of venezuela in 1998 having assumed the reign of power chavez decided that the bulk of the profit from the country s oil should go to the masses this was opposed by the elite establishment who made frantic efforts to get him out of office through a coup this forced hugo chavez to travel to the socialist republic of cuba in 2003 on his return chavez decided to make venezuela a socilaist state he started by nationalising or giving state control to many businesses including electricity telecommunication and the oil sector luckily for him in 2004 the global oil prices began to surge oil prices increased from 27 in 2003 to 91 in 2013 hugo chavez embarked on social programmes with proceeds from the oil his social programmes included subsidising the cost of food investing in the country s education building affordable housing for the poor among many other programmes in fact within a record time hugo chavez had reduced poverty by more than half at one point venezuela even provided free heating oil for impoverished americans yes americans then out of nowhere oil prices started to go down because countries such as the us and canada began to increase their oil production since venezuela needed more money to sustain its numerous social programmes the easiest option was to print more money to meet the short to medium term demands with the hope that the tide will turn president hugo chavez died of cancer in 2013 and was succeeded by his right hand man nicolás maduro who narrowly won and was sworn in as president but oil prices continued to go down and fell as low as 41 in 2015 foreign demand for venezuela s currency bolívar to buy venezuelan oil crashed maduro was forced to print more money and cancel some of the social programmes initiated by hugo chavez his predecessor the printing of money led to high inflation and high depreciation people then began to save their money in foreign currency like the us dollar to hedge against the fast depreciation as the country s currency s value fell the cost of imported goods rose the venezuelan economy went into crisis international investors began looking elsewhere driving the value of the bolívar even lower the government responded by issuing currency controls it set a fixed exchange rate to stop the official value of the bolívar dropping against the us dollar and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolívares into us dollars the idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions this led to mass protests these protests forced a coalition of opposition political parties called the democratic unity roundtable or mud to come together and form a coalition the opposition coalition contested and won two thirds of the national assembly putting the president s rule at risk in response maduro forced out several supreme court justices and filled in with fresh judges loyal to him in march 2016 the court ruled to strip the opposition led national assembly of its powers which escalated the protest on the streets of caracas this forced the supreme court to reverse its decision but the damage had already been inflicted and the protest continued the us then issued sanctions on venezuela us sanctions mean the country could not re finance its debt leading to high and high inflation amidst these protests president nicolás maduro launched his re election bid the opposition coalition boycotted the elections but maduro won amidst accusations of irregularities and voter intimidation backed by the us the opposition leader juan guaido declared himself interim president in january this year after invoking the venezuelan constitution this has set up a power struggle that is yet to be resolved lessons for ghana ghana is not immune to the crisis in venezuela if we don t watch our expenditure and the desire by the political class to promise free things to woo voters the hard truth is that nothing is free if a politician promises you something free ask yourself who is paying for it if our politicians will continue to make hefty electoral promises with the view that we have oil revenue that will pay for such promises what become of such promises when oil prices take a nosedive the global slam down in oil prices was one of the key reasons why ghana had to run to the international monetary fund imf for help this is because ghana s economic growth has been hedged on oil since 2010 when the country became a full blown commercial oil producer ghana was not the only country that suffered when oil prices dropped oil dependent countries including giants like saudi arabia nigeria and others had to take some austerity measures to survive this is because they all had failed to diversify their economies and given the volatility of oil prices their economies suffered some shocks ghana s situation was pretty precarious because the drop in oil prices also coincided with the energy sector crisis popularly known as dumsor this drop in foreign exchange through the sale of oil forced up inflation and led to high depreciation of the cedi leading to the cedi recording one of its highest depreciation in recent history as the country is gearing up for the 2020 elections our politicians should not be carried away by the desire to win power to the extent of forgetting about how and where they will get money to finance their campaign pledges we should realise that oil is a finite resource and we do not also control its prices as a country have we thought about how we are going to sustain the social programmes that are funded by our oil resources when we deplete our oil reserves so dear mr politician what is the price of your free promises writer abdul karim

and it s true as trump supporters note that obama s economy was showing signs of slowing when he left office with gdp growth of 1 9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 but overall obama had multiple quarters of robust growth including over half a dozen over 3 percent and several over 4 percent obama s high water mark came in the third quarter of 2014 when growth raced ahead 5 2 percent so making the case that trump has presided over a great american comeback could be challenging we went from an economy that was putting up more jobs per year than it has been under trump when he was saying the real unemployment rate was like 42 percent to as soon as he took office saying look how low the unemployment rate is said austan goolsbee the university of chicago professor who served as chair of the council of economic advisers under obama the economy is fine and it s been fine for 8 to 10 years the longest boom we ve ever had and that s good two thirds of that was before trump got there but he s going to try and take credit for all of it only people who are already for him will really believe it goolsbee said still despite numbers suggesting the trump economy is mostly an extension of obama s with an added burst in 2018 after the tax cut the president may find a receptive audience to his pitch on tuesday night polls indicate the economy remains by far his strongest issue and the one most likely to drive him to a second term despite an approval rating that hovers in the low 40s according to a recent new york times surveymonkey poll 40 percent of americans say they are better off than a year ago and just 19 percent say they are worse off the best numbers in the three years of the survey and independent voters showed the biggest jump in confidence according to the times poll it s not clear voters actually care that much about the big jump in the deficit which according to the congressional budget office says will hit 1 02 trillion in 2020 after rounds of tax cuts and spending increases and will keep rising in years to come deficits generally shrink in times of low unemployment and moderate growth

currencies for the most part drifted yesterday chuck explains gold swaps leases good day and a tom terrific tuesday to you another chamber of commerce day here yesterday i wasn t feeling 100 or even 75 but i struggled to get outside and the sun sure felt good and warm just how i like it i believe that the chemo that i take daily has gone bad on me i m continually fighting stomach problems while the tumor in my mouth remains unchanged in size i went to dinner last night with my good friend martini gus and i had to have 1 2 of a petit ribeye wrapped to take home because i almost became violently ill but drank a lot of ice water and got through it my appetite is going to the wayside i can t put anything that has carbonation or spice in my mouth so i sent off a note to my oncologist last night asking her if i can go off the chemo for a week or so to get my system straight knowing how much she loves me ha i m sure she ll give me the wink and nod three dog night greets me this morning with their song mamma told me not to come well i didn t do much after my trip north yesterday and neither did the currencies as there was no follow up to the overnight selling of currencies and buying of dollars the euro is trading in the same clothes as yesterday and the poor petrol currencies can t seem to find a bid these days especially with the price of oil slip sliding away this morning oil is trading with a 50 one more day of selling of the black gold texas tea and we ll be below 50 and the shale folks will be closing down their rigs as this seems to be the level that sends them home as i m sure the cost of getting the shale oil our of the rocks is much more expensive than traditional ways if i m wrong about that just chalk it up to me not knowing that much about the oil sector the key petrol currency is the russian ruble and i found this on the russia today site yesterday there s a lot going for the russian economy as 2020 kicks into its second month russia s government reshuffle is seen as removing austerity constraints and speeding up the financing of putin s ambitious national development programs in his speech to the national assembly putin signaled the end of austerity on social spending russia being the only country in the developed world which is now seriously increasing social spending among other things increasing pensions double the rate of inflation and initiating massive child support programs while everyone else is cutting that s all fine and dandy but the ruble is a petrol currency and as long as the price of oil stays down so too will the ruble even if the russian economy turns the corner and starts running on all eight the biggest mover overnight was drumroll please the chinese renminbi and the move was not a good one the peoples bank of china pboc must be feeling the markets fears about the coronavirus spreading even wider because they took a huge chunk out of the renminbi in one fell swoop the renminbi is trading back to 7 and change this morning and now that the trade negotiations are no longer a black cloud over china and the u s has dropped the currency manipulator tag from china the renminbi gets chopped typical chinese reaction if you ask me the other big mover yesterday and again this morning is gold the shiny metal lost 12 yesterday and is down another 7 this morning one day a safe haven the next day not so much eh the high price for gold yesterday was 1 598 but it closed at 1 576 as i said yesterday either the exchange stabilization fund esf or the plunge protection team ppt was working overtime to make certain that the dollar remains strong speaking of gold i read last night that russia is probably going to be named the 1 producer of gold for last year taking the title away from china whether russia gets the title or not the point is that both russia and china do not sell the gold they produce so therefore the numbers that are used to denote the total gold each respective country has in reserves is undercooked by a large margin which in my opinion has the makings of a very difficult scene for the non russia china countries when the current financial system collapses from the weight of debt and derivatives and each country comes to the table to reorganize the new financial system and shows their hand at how much gold they have that s when it will occur to everyone that the old adage of he who has the gold makes the rules will hit them like a v 8 forehead slap i m just saying there s this thing called gold swaps or leases the banks that hold gold see it as a non interest bearing possession and so they look for a way to swap it for cash that they can lend out at huge mark ups the problem with that is that the outfit that bought the gold in the swap no longer owns it they sold it in pieces to a thousand different customers so the bank let s say the fed reserve has an iou for gold in their vault which i don t think is going to carry much weight at the reorganization table which is why i don t understand why congress won t pass the audit the fed bill no wait i do understand what i don t understand is why congress doesn t have the intestinal fortitude to pass the bill well i was wrong mark that down about the december ism manufacturing index as it did recover back above the 50 mark after two previous months of below 50 prints i don t know if this data is fidgeted but it sure seems a bit strange to me that after last month s print was even deeper below 50 that the trend was in and it would continue to drop but then out of left field comes a rebound just like that go figure eh today s data cupboard has the december factory orders which in november were negative but given the recovery in the ism one would have to think that this data too will recover we will end the week with the jobs jamboree for january i just don t see this being a good report folks but then i really don t care about the numbers any longer they are cooked massaged recooked and massaged again until the bls gets the number they want the fwiw section article i had for you yesterday proves what i ve been saying for years now that it doesn t matter how many jobs were created what matters is whether or not they were high paying jobs and not min wage jobs which from the article seems to be saying has been happening to recap the currencies drifted on monday but the biggest mover overnight was the chinese renminbi which lost a large chunk of value in one fell swoop the fear of the coronavirus spreading even wider caused the mark down along with some other items that chuck discusses above gold also was a big mover yesterday losing 12 and is down another 7 this morning safe haven one day and not so much the next day eh chuck feels is the work of either the esf or ppt or here s your snippet the chairman of the federal reserve jerome jay powell regularly states at his press conferences that the federal reserve is there to serve the interests of the american people but his actions regularly undermine the credibility of that statement in a manner not all that dissimilar to alan greenspan whose fed chairmanship oversaw the gutting of wall street banking regulations and ended just before the greatest wall street collapse since the great depression powell goes out of his way to present himself at his press conferences as the quintessential public servant whose only mission is to perform the mandate set out by the elected representatives in congress while his actions strongly suggest he is a wily rogue agent for wall street s cartel of bank trading houses congress set out its mandate for the federal reserve and its fellow regulators to follow when it comes to monitoring and disciplining wall street banks in the passage of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act that was enacted on july 21 2010 the legislation was meant to rein in the greed corruption and illegal trading activities of wall street banks that had led to the financial crash and great recession where 8 7 million americans lost their jobs and 10 million american homes were lost to foreclosure from 2006 to 2014 one of the key provisions of dodd frank instructed the federal reserve that it would be on a short leash going forward in terms of secret multi trillion dollar bailouts of wall street s trading houses without the approval or even awareness of congress the federal reserve predominantly through the federal reserve bank of new york had showered 29 trillion in cumulative loans to bail out wall street s trading houses from the end of 2007 through the middle of 2010 the federal reserve fought a court battle for years to keep that information secret from the american people that was on federal reserve chairman ben bernanke s watch but this is what has happened on chairman powell s watch chuck again a great article about how crazy the fed and fed ny have gotten and how they are disobeying the rules that congress set for them i just shake my heard in disbelief and disgust currencies today 2 4 20 american style a 6718 kiwi 6461 c 7532 euro 1 1050 sterling 1 3277 swiss 1 0322 european style rand 14 7090 krone 9 2405 sek

moonrise over the ocean sometimes the vision is amazing i simply love it looks like another good day outside so i ll head out there as soon as i finish my crossword puzzles i do each morning after writing the pfennig except days i have to head to a doctor appt not much else going on to write about except i would like everyone to say a prayer for my good friend dennis miller who received some devastating cancer news this week and while you re at it say a prayer for my friend ty keough who s in icu right now and get this the song that takes us to the finish line today is the doobie brothers singing jesus is alright i hope you have a tom terrific tuesday and please be good to yourself
by dr tapiwa mashakada has the zimbabwean economy imploded as yet or how many times should it implode with an annual inflation rate of 600 and a projected negative growth rate of 10 in 2020 a looming food and humanitarian crisis zimbabwe is imploding zimbabwe poverty indices are the highest in sadc high cost of utilities especially electricity charges have gone out control fuel is out of reach and industry is grinding to a halt for me this is real implosion the real economy has long been decimated and what we are dealing with are remnants of the once vibrant economy which used to be the bread basket of africa with a strong currency stronger than the usd in 1980 yet despite our economic malaise we still have a huge potential of exponential growth if we do the right things we are the most educated country in africa and proud owners of vast mineral wealth and natural resources above all the educated youth bulge is a demographic dividend despite the closure of democratic space and the trampling of people s freedoms and rights our country can rise again if we all put the country first understanding the problem is fine but let us focus more on solutions in terms of alternative solutions we propose the following 1 political governance institutional and economic reforms to create a conducive environment leading to peace stability confidence and economic growth zanu pf and ed must show leadership and magnanimity they must take responsibility for failing to run government and causing the economic free fall to date it is in the interest of the country for ed to unite and galvanize the nation it is now common cause that adv nelson chamisa the mdc president garnered 2 6 million votes in the 2018 elections and he carries this mass base and support with him he cannot be ignored in the governance and leadership equation of the country that will be equivalent to committing the ostrich s offence so the issue of legitimacy should be addressed through an honest national dialogue 2 domestic and foreign investment is required because growth is constrained by capital deficiencies the private sector desperately needs lines of credit let us remove all barriers 3 harnessing and mobilizing domestic sources of revenue is key the low hanging fruit is tourism which has the potential to raise usd 1 billion in receipts per annum the next low hanging fruit is beneficiation and value addition of raw materials and minerals which has the potential to raise usd 10 billion per annum the third low hanging fruit is fighting corruption which has the potential to recover and lock in usd 20 billion per annum 4 policy consistency can assist in building confidence 5 addressing the currency and exchange rate conundrum should be given key priority simultenous with the building of foreign currency reserves at the reserve bank for purposes of macroeconomic stability zimbabwe needs a stable currency which is a store of value for as long as we do not produce the zim dollar will remain a destabilizing force in the economy the alternative is to redollarize for a time bound period in order to stabilize prices after all the economy has since self dollarized 6 the diaspora should be offered financial and economic incentives so they can institutionalize their remittances 7 the budget deficit must always be kept under lock and key there is a temptation under sovereign currencies to print money for seigniorage revenue the monetary policy committee must vaccinate itself against the monetization of the deficit and abuse of the central bank overdraft 8 the central bank must be given monetary policy independence but should guard itself against quasi fiscal operations which are slowly creeping in 9 parastatal reforms are difficult to implement i think there should be established a parastatals reform commission to replace sera which is arguably failing to usher reforms and instil financial discipline and good corporate governance 10 dealing with the public service and social sectors which are burning zimbabwe has to deal with a deep humanitarian crisis in the urban areas in regard to the quality of healthcare services hospitals have no drugs or equipment medical personnel is demoralized and hospitals are now death chambers 11 an urgent zimbabwe conference is required to raise new capital to strengthen the budget and attract official development assistance 12 zimbabwe should engage the paris club for consideration under the highly indebted poor countries hipic this is a practical plan to deal with arrears and debt zim has no capacity to service its debts 13 pro poor policies and social safety nets are necessary to protect the vulnerable social base austerity has never succeeded in africa because it is not a developmental strategy austerity is not human centred it is inspired by the discredited neo liberal washington consensus it is not progressive 14 drought mitigation should be implemented in a non partisan manner throughout the country s 10 provinces food aid is being distributed on party lines food is used as a political weapon why are development agencies not seeing this ploy 15 zimbabwe must invest in its infrastructure this sector has potential to create jobs investment in renewable energy should be prioritized 16 restoration of agriculture and the rural economy is key to the recovery of this agro based economy zim must work out a viable pricing policy for agricultural products and ratchet up new markets innovation and mechanization will be boosted by irrigation 17 the country should preserve peace and stability at all times and threat and menace of mashurugwis should be confronted 18 local government is a key arm of government in this regard devolution must happen now development of communities and service delivery can be facilitated through devolution 19 priority should be given to water and sanitation hygiene wash in urban and rural areas 20 the beitbridge harare chirundu highway is of national strategic importance this highway carries 90 of zimbabwean trade the road forms a greater part of the north south corridor and is important under the african continental free trade area afcfta conclusion we urge all zimbabweans at home and in the diaspora to consider and examine our alternative working proposals in the form of the the zimbabwe we want 20 point plan by the grace of god zimbabwe can be saved dr tapiwa mashakada is the opposition movement for democratic change mdc mp for hatfield and a chief economic trade and investment facilitation expert he was the minister for planning and investment in the coalition government of zimbabwe between 2009 2013
new zealand dollar underperforms even as jobs data eats away at rbnz rate cut bets nzd underperforms in global risk rebound wednesday jobless rate falls to lowest sine 2008 but jobs growth stalls data lifts market implied cash rates for the rbnz this year assumption is now that no rbnz cuts likely in months ahead but uncertain impact of coronavirus is risk to growth and nzd virus spread seen slowing but nzd remains sensitive to cnh image adobe stock gbp nzd spot rate 2 005 up 0 03 today indicative bank rates for transfers 1 9357 1 9497 indicative broker rates for transfers 1 9758 1 9878 find out more about this rate the new zealand dollar underperformed wednesday even as a surprise fall in unemployment lifted market implied cash rates for the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz throughout the 2020 year enabling the pound to new zealand dollar rate to remain supported close to its post referendum high final quarter jobs figures were a mixed bag for markets with a surprise fall in the jobless rate being offset by stalling employment growth jobs growth was 0 in the final quarter last year although the unemployment rate fell from a downwardly revised 4 1 to 4 its lowest since the middle of 2008 and wages grew by 0 6 quarter on quarter and at an annualised pace of 2 6 with both being ahead of market expectations although the kiwi dollar was only able to rise against safe haven currencies on wednesday and underperformed other risk rivals like the aussie and pound sterling the unemployment rate dropped to 4 0 but was largely driven by a fall in the participation rate to 70 1 employment growth was unchanged over the quarter says kim mundy a strategist at commonwealth bank of australia our asb colleagues continue to expect another rate cut in may 2020 because of downside risks however the risk is that the rbnz has already done enough to stimulate the economy and will hold off rate cuts over 2020 supporting nzd above new zealand dollar performance against major rivals wednesday source pound sterling live new zealand s economy is now by all accounts close to the full employment coveted by inflation targeting central banks which should mean that wages soon begin to rise and in the process support a return of the consumer price index above the midpoint of the 1 to 3 inflation target full employment and at target inflation is what the rbnz wants to see and the prospect of such objectives being realised is why investors bet wednesday there s now a lesser chance of a fourth rate cut coming in 2020 the rbnz cut rates three times last year taking the cash rate from 1 75 to 1 as it sought to protect the domestic economy from a global slowdown and meet its long elusive inflation target however the bank hinted in november that the bar for additional rate cuts is now rather high prompting the markets to pare back earlier bets suggesting it would cut rates twice this year that trend continued on wednesday and the assumption is now that not even one rate cut can be taken as a given for the rbnz these data reaffirm a strong starting point relative to the november mps with inflation and the labour market in a comfortable position the rbnz can afford to be patient and see how developments unfold in light of emerging and highly uncertain global risks associated with the tragic new coronavirus says miles workman an economist at anz above pound to new zealand dollar rate shown at daily intervals markets are still leaning towards a cut but pricing in the ois curve isn t really all that aggressive says bipan rai north american head of fx strategy at cibc capital markets much like the aud some consolidation is needed for nzd usd before directionality is to be determined either via incoming data or the central bank s bias at the upcoming meeting for now our bias is to remain flat and we ll reassess if nzd usd breaks below 0 6400 pricing in the overnight index swap market implied on wednesday a february 12 cash rate of 0 99 and a november 11 cash rate of 0 86 those numbers are up from 0 59 and 0 49 respectively on 10 october 2019 the day before the u s china phase one deal was announced current pricing suggests strongly that markets see only a minor probability of another rate cut this year and that s not until near to year end although a february pricing out of that potential might still be positive for the kiwi we expect the rbnz will abandon its strong easing bias and move to a more neutral monetary policy outlook says bill evans chief economist at westpac the rbnz will also take comfort from the general improvement in global economic sentiment over recent months even though the actual economic data remains weak and the coronavirus poses a new set of uncertainties tuesday s jobs data came amid still elevated concerns over the spread of a new coronavirus in china which has turned cities into ghost towns across the world s second largest economy and is threatening to deal a severe blow to it in the first quarter that would have consequences that stretch way beyond the borders of china and certainly as far as the kiwi capital wellington the wuhan virus and the extensive efforts to contain it will deliver a substantial hit to growth in china over the coming months and poses a more significant threat to the global economy and world markets than has been the case with previous epidemics but beyond this we re left facing more questions than answers says neil shearing chief economist at capital economics above nzd usd rate shown at daily intervals markets are hoping the coronavirus epidemic in china will prove short lived and that the subsequent return to normal will be quick which are sentiments that might have been encouraged overnight by the latest declarations from the national health commission infections were at 24 324 as of midnight tuesday up from 20 438 the previous day while the number of fatalities rose from 425 to 490 marking a slower rate of increase than that observed in prior days however taiwanese daily taiwan news reported wednesday that the true number of infections in china could be as high as 154 023 and the number of deaths as high as 24 589 it cited information that was momentarily displayed on a tencent electronic board that implies a mortality rate of more than 15 that s somewhat different to the low single digit mortality rate purported by official numbers wednesday is reportedly the third time that tencent numbers have been drastically higher than those of the national health commission official numbers have each day implied remarkably uniform and stable growth rates for infections and deaths with last week s pattern showing numbers increasing by around 30 in each category on a daily basis only for the growth rates of each to then decline to around 15 thus far this week data due in the next week or so should give a better sense of how badly economic activity has been hit by the outbreak and given the incubation period of the virus the effectiveness of the containment efforts will also start to become clearer providing clues to how long lasting the disruption is likely to be says julian evans pritchard a senior china economist at capital economics above capital economics graph contrasting coronavirus infection and death numbers with those of sars a chinese government economist said last week that first quarter growth could slip below 5 on an annualised basis due to the epidemic while the latest speculation is that the official growth target could fall as low as 4 5 to 5 for the full year and goldman sachs economists estimated tuesday that global gdp growth could slow by 20 basis points as a result of the outbreak although these numbers are all contingent upon a swift end to the crisis new zealand s largest trading partner is china so the kiwi currency can easily be influenced by the trajectory of the yuan which has been remarkably stable since the outbreak began to gather pace just more than a week ago peoples bank of china pboc intervention has helped keep the yuan stable while the ebbing spread of the infection has incited hope that the worst might now be over but stability could give way to a sell off if the infection s spread accelerates again at any point

economists warn the us expansion now in its record long 11th year faces an array of threats washington a portrait of a robust us economy is sure to take centre stage feb 4 when president donald trump gives his third state of the union address it is an economy that has proved solid and durable yet hasn t fulfilled many of trump s promises nine months before the election the economy keeps growing steadily if only modestly unemployment is at a half century low and consumers the lifeblood of the us economy continue to spend average pay is rising faster than when trump took office three years ago with the largest percentage gains now going to lower wage workers some research has found that this trend which began in 2015 before trump s election partly reflects higher state minimum wages economists warn though that the us expansion now in its record long 11th year faces an array of threats most immediately china s viral outbreak has paralyzed business with the world s second largest economy starbucks and apple have closed stores in china airlines have cancelled flights and companies like general motors have halted production there all of that could shave one half percentage point off annual growth in the first quarter goldman sachs economists forecast though they expect the slowdown to be offset by a rebound in the second quarter boeing s decision to halt production of its 737 max should also weaken growth in the first six months of the year economists say advertisement america s manufacturing sector is struggling a reflection of trump s trade conflicts high corporate debt levels have sparked concerns some analysts also worry that the federal reserve s ultra low interest rates have helped feed risky bubbles in stocks or other assets and leading democratic presidential candidates especially sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built their campaigns to unseat trump around the message that the economy remains rife with inequality with many workers struggling to afford college housing or health care trump is unlikely to let any such doubts temper his standard message that under his stewardship the economy is thriving unemployment is falling the stock market is roaring and that the best days are still ahead i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before trump said last month in davos switzerland america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before yet what trump calls an unprecedented boom is by many measures not all that different from the solid economy he inherited from president barack obama economic growth was 2 3 in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of obama s eight year presidency during the 2016 campaign trump boasted that his tax cut plan would boost annual growth to 4 a year a brisk pace not seen since the late 1990 s instead trump along with obama is one of two presidents since world war ii not to have presided over a year of at least 3 growth and few economists think the economy will hit that target this year most analysts do think trump s tax plan helped accelerate growth just not the way he had promised the trump tax cuts were a sugar high that juiced the economy temporarily said ryan sweet an economist at moody s analytics it put more money in americans pockets boosting consumer spending the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 a healthy pace though the same as in 2015 the year before trump s election the administration had vowed though that the tax cuts would do more than just encourage americans to shop more the president s top economists had said the tax cuts would accelerate corporate investment in machinery computers and plants and office towers all the new equipment would make workers more efficient the argument went thereby boosting productivity the amount of output for each hour worked greater productivity is one of the two main drivers of growth the other is an increase in the number of us workers both have slowed in the past decade most economists partly blame trump s trade wars particularly with china the trade conflicts have left american companies much less certain about the economic outlook and reluctant to expand and invest business investment shrank in the final three quarters of last year nor have trump s business tax cuts and deregulation made the economy more dynamic the growth of new companies has remained anemic since the 2008 downturn larger businesses continue to dominate many industries from technology to retail to finance all this is occurring despite significant stimulus trump has assailed fed chairman jerome powell for not cutting rates more though the fed s benchmark rate is now in a range of just 1 5 to 1 75 a very low level historically and one that is considered stimulative and increased federal spending has also helped support the economy the congressional budget office last week projected that the government s deficit will top 1 trillion annually for the next decade the accelerator is on the floor but the vehicle is moving surprisingly slowly larry summers treasury secretary under president bill clinton and a top economic adviser to obama said in early january trump has also recently highlighted what he calls a blue collar boom pointing to solid wage gains for lower paid workers and healthy hiring in construction and manufacturing but manufacturing jobs barely grew last year as factories hunkered down in the midst of the trade wars and since trump s inauguration manufacturing jobs have grown more slowly than employment overall has ernie goss an economics professor at creighton university in nebraska said the midwest s job growth has amounted to only about three quarters of the national pace since trump took office farmers have also suffered from the trade war he said as retaliatory tariffs by china have clobbered exports of soybeans and other commodities that in turn has hurt manufacturers of farm equipment including deere and caterpillar everyone says the economy is going great guns but that is everything except agriculture and manufacturing goss said what s more most campaign battleground states in the midwest such as michigan pennsylvania ohio and wisconsin have lost factory jobs in the past year most manufacturing job growth under trump s presidency has occurred in southern and western states said dean baker senior economist at the liberal center for economic and policy research with fewer union members in those states those factory jobs generally pay less in fact manufacturing jobs once a bulwark of the postwar middle class now pay less on average than private sector jobs overall baker said still despite modest growth the record economic expansion has endured under trump there is also evidence that its durability has in recent years finally started to benefit a broader swath of americans more people have come off the sidelines and found jobs defying most economists predictions the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who are employed is now higher than before the great recession and last year wages rose nearly 5 for the poorest one fourth of americans far more than for the richest fourth whose pay rose just 3 according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta still richer americans hold a far greater portion of the nation s wealth with the top 10 owning nearly 85 of the value of all stocks the moderate pace of growth has meant that so far the economy isn t showing evident signs of excess akin to the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial meltdown this expansion has been slow and steady but it could run for a few more years sweet said there s no reason that it needs to die sometimes slow and steady does win the race

briefing highlights endangering the economy stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance australian central bank holds rates tesla stock surges bp raises dividend what analysts are saying today required reading the state of borrowing many canadians are of course financially responsible but others are endangering canada s economy through their plump debts the macdonald laurier institute warns and they can include governments and companies philip cross a munk senior fellow at the mli said in a quarterly economic report particularly worrisome has been canada s soaring debt to gdp ratio which has exceeded 300 per cent said mr cross formerly statistics canada s chief economic analyst all sectors have gorged themselves on credit since interest rates were cut during and after the 2008 2009 great financial crisis he added households corporations and governments each have raised their debt load to about 100 per cent of gdp high debt levels across households and governments mean canada is quite vulnerable to a downturn in the global economy consumers have led this borrowing binge as mr cross noted indeed canadians are infamous for their borrowing habits the key measure of household credit market debt to disposable income now stands at a high 175 9 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis and the latest numbers as tallied by bank of nova scotia show borrowing still going strong though the pace of growth has slowed total household credit growth rose 4 9 per cent in december from january on an annualized basis scotiabank deputy chief economist brett house and senior research analyst alena bystrova noted in their study this week that s down from november s pace of 5 9 per cent the deceleration of household credit growth in the month was driven mainly by slower though still strong mortgage growth that was partially offset by a spike in consumer credit they said total household credit grew by 4 2 per cent year over year in 2019 compared with 3 5 per cent year over year in 2018 debt levels are growing at a faster pace than incomes underscoring how household and government spending remain dependent on debt financing mr cross said noting that consumer insolvency filings have been rising debtors are always vulnerable to two types of shocks one is a sharp hike in interest rates the other is losing some income either through job loss or lower prices mr cross said the latter seems the largest threat to canada in the short term given that the global economic slowdown evident for some time in europe and asia now seems to have spread to the united states where growth decelerated from 3 per cent in 2018 to 2 per cent in 2019 while canada s economy is vulnerable we re very unlikely to see a banking crisis though borrowing by canadian governments is at almost 85 per cent of gdp mr cross noted compared to 97 5 per cent in the euro zone and 99 4 per cent in the u s both the euro zone and the americans were forced to spend liberally to rescue banks during the crisis government borrowing in canada is more skewed to the provinces because our federation is the most decentralized and because some provinces are especially vulnerable to slumps in key export markets and unwilling to adjust their spending accordingly mr cross said it is a testament to the vapidity of the recent federal election that canada s growing indebtedness was barely discussed he added federal government debt surfaced briefly as an issue with the government arguing that it accounts for only about 30 percentage points or one tenth of canada s overall debt to income ratio of 300 per cent completely ignored were the huge amount of debts accumulated in the corporate household and provincial government sectors and the vulnerability this debt creates for a highly cyclical economy like canada s also just this week toronto dominion bank warned that the rise of nonfinancial corporate leverage in canada is an emerging risk indeed more company income is being used to service debt and this debt service ratio is high relative to history and international peers td economic analyst brett saldarelli and senior economist james orlando said in their study should the economic backdrop deteriorate the level of corporate indebtedness would act as an amplifier and increase the severity of a recession they said the indebted canadian consumer and high house prices will probably remain in the spotlight this year as they have for many years added brian belski bank of montreal s chief investment strategist while we agree that the canadian consumer is clearly stretched with elevated

lebanon s new government formed in late january following three months of mass protests and political deadlock amid the country s worst economic crisis since its 1975 1990 civil war the new prime minister hassan diab a former education minister and professor at the american university of beirut argues that his downsized technocratic government is committed to extensive economic reform but appealing rhetoric aside diab s cabinet is not built to last it is incapable of meaningfully addressing lebanon s dire economic situation or any of the other serious challenges the country faces diab s new cabinet is one third smaller than that of his predecessor saad hariri it comprises 20 politicians six of them women who all lack experience as ministers however the introduction of these new faces is a cosmetic change at best many of diab s ministers are explicitly politically loyal to the elite who are largely responsible for the country s current woes this is especially true of the heads of key ministries diab himself came to power thanks to endorsements from hezbollah the amal movement and president michel aoun s free patriotic movement which alongside smaller parties now hold a majority in parliament they are propping up the new government without the support of pro western political rivals including hariri s future movement the country s largest sunni party finance minister ghazi wazni was appointed by speaker of parliament nabih berri a political behemoth after serving as an adviser to parliament s finance and budget committee wazni who also has links to commercial banks and central bank governor riad salamé helped shape a fiscal policy that has contributed to lebanon s current economic crisis meanwhile raymond ghajar now heads an energy ministry in which he worked as a senior adviser for 13 years mostly under gebran bassil who leads the free patriotic movement lebanon s electricity sector is so weak and inefficient that many people have long had to pay for external generators riots broke out in downtown beirut on the night of diab s appointment even if diab and his ministers intend to introduce significant reforms the elite will more than likely block any measures that challenge entrenched interests lebanon s most powerful figures a mixture of business magnates and former warlords will always have the last word owning large shares of the country s commercial banks and other businesses they can call on the support of the extensive patronage networks they have built over decades therefore despite the formation of the new government power ultimately remains in their hands diab and his ministers can do little more than make gestures designed to placate the protesters their powerlessness has already become evident lebanon passed its 2020 budget just days after the new cabinet was sworn in given that the budget was drawn up by hariri diab and his ministers had no say in what could have been a key instrument of structural economic reform in the meantime the protests have become more violent people have lost patience with a leadership that has refused to meet their demands to implement an economic policy that does not harm ordinary people to guarantee the independence of the judiciary to take on corruption cases and to take serious action to mitigate the impact of increasingly severe inflation a hike in prices and restrictions on withdrawals of us dollars some protesters believe that political parties are trying to hijack their uprising and deceive them with cosmetic changes riots broke out in downtown beirut on the night of diab s appointment as protesters trying to prevent parliament from establishing quorum to pass the 2020 budget engaged in scuffles with riot police the lebanese army and the parliamentary guard allegations that the police have engaged in torture arbitrary detentions and other violence against protesters and journalists have fuelled public anger the lebanese elite appear to believe that they can outlast the protests yet rather than meeting protesters demands lebanon s ruling parties are appealing to the international community for much needed economic aid which they believe can help the country return to normalcy they have already met with the international monetary fund which has previously recommended an increase in regressive measures such as value added tax and in support for the private sector despite the fact that many companies are under the control of the elite since april 2018 lebanon s government has scrambled to implement reforms that would facilitate around 11 1 billion in loans from the international community for infrastructure and development projects wazni now seeks between 4 billion and 5 billion in immediate external support to import basic goods such as medicine wheat and fuel the international community via the un led international support group has backed the lebanese government since the uprising seeking to strike a balance between calls for vital reforms and precautions against the collapse of the entire system but with the new government widely perceived as being dominated by the iranian backed hezbollah and with the united states focused on reducing iran s regional influence it remains uncertain to what extent lebanon will receive such economic aid especially if it fails to engage in the reforms demanded by some foreign powers indeed even hariri s government which included representatives of all major parties struggled to secure economic aid most worryingly even if the country does gain international financial support the price of this is likely to be crippling austerity measures that further strain the country s socioeconomic fabric given current economic conditions the lack of universal education and a welfare system that is virtually non existent one can only expect the worst the new government may be tasked with implementing these painful measures and thereby shifting the blame for them away from the elite but there is a risk that this will only reignite the protests

harnik file
jonathan lemire the associated press washington standing before a congress and nation sharply divided by impeachment president donald trump used his state of the union address tuesday to extol a great american comeback on his watch three years after he took office decrying a land of american carnage under his predecessor the first president to run for reelection after being impeached trump received a raucous but divided response from congress with republicans in the house of representatives chanting four more years while democrats stood mute america s enemies are on the run america s fortunes are on the rise and the america s future is blazing bright trump declared in just three short years we have shattered the mentality of american decline and we have rejected the downsizing of america s destiny we are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never going back setting a yardstick for success and then contending he d surpassed it trump has now gone from an inaugural address that decried american carnage to extolling the great american comeback offering the nation s economic success as a chief rationale for a second term trump spent much of the speech highlighting the economy s strength including low unemployment stressing how it has helped blue collar workers and the middle class though the period of growth began under his predecessor barack obama and what trump calls an unprecedented boom is by many measures not all that different from the solid economy he inherited from president barack obama economic growth was 2 3 in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of obama s eight year presidency trump stressed the new trade agreements he has negotiated including his phase one deal with china and the united states mexico canada agreement he signed last month the main suspense was whether he would address the charges against him trump spoke from the house of representatives on the opposite side of the capitol from where the senate one day later was expected to acquit him largely along party lines the first half of his nationally televised speech was largely optimistic not mentioning the impeachment trial that has consumed washington in favour of a recitation of accomplishments and promises yet the partisan divide within washington was embodied by the woman over his left shoulder visible in nearly every camera shot house speaker nancy pelosi a frequent thorn in trump s side who authorized the impeachment proceedings that charged the president with abusing the power of his office to push ukraine to investigate a political foe pelosi created a viral image with her seemingly sarcastic applause of the president a year ago trump appeared no more cordial when he climbed to the house rostrum he did not take her outstretched hand but it was not clear he had seen her gesture later as republicans often cheered she remained in her seat at times shaking her head at trump s remarks even for a trump era news cycle that seems permanently set to hyper speed the breakneck pace of events dominating the first week of february offered a singular backdrop for the president s address supreme court chief justice john roberts who has presided in the senate over only the third impeachment trial in the nation s history was on hand again tuesday night this time in his more customary seat in the audience trump stood before the very lawmakers who have voted to remove him from office and those who are expected to acquit him when the senate trial comes to a close the leading senate democrats hoping to unseat him in november were campaigning in new hampshire in advance of his address trump tweeted that the chaos in iowa s monday leadoff caucuses showed democrats were incompetent and should not be trusted to run the government among trump s guests in the chamber venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido who has been trying for months to win face time with trump his most important international ally the president offered guaido exactly the sort of endorsement he s been looking for as he struggles to oust president nicolas maduro from power trump called guaido the true and legitimate president of venezuela mr president please take this message back to your homeland trump said all americans are united with the venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul trump entered the night on a roll with his impeachment acquittal imminent his job approval numbers ticking upward and wall street looking strong in the closest historical comparison bill clinton did not mention his recent impeachment when he delivered his state of the union in 1999 in his address a year ago trump did remain on message making no mention of how pelosi had originally disinvited him from delivering the speech during the longest government shutdown in the nation s history trump spent much of the speech highlighting the economy s strength including low unemployment stressing how it has helped blue collar workers and the middle class though the period of growth began under his predecessor barack obama and what trump calls an unprecedented boom is by many measures not all that different from the solid economy he inherited from president barack obama economic growth was 2 3 in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of obama s eight year presidency trump stressed the new trade agreements he has negotiated including his phase one deal with china and the united states mexico canada agreement he signed last month while the white house said the president would have a message of unity he also spent time on issues that have created great division and resonated with his political base he attacked democrats health care proposals for being too intrusive and again highlighted his signature issue immigration trumpeting the miles of border wall that have been constructed he also dedicated a section to american values discussing efforts to protect religious liberties and limit access to abortion as he continues to court the evangelical and conservative christian voters who form a crucial part of his base the democrats were supplying plenty of counter programming focusing on health care the issue key to their takeover of the house last year trump for his part vowed to not allow a socialist takeover of our health care system a swipe at the medicare for all proposal endorsed by some of his democratic challengers many female democrats were wearing white as tribute to the suffragettes who helped win the vote for women while a number in the party were wearing red white and blue striped lapel pins to highlight climate change saying trump has rolled back environmental safeguards and given free rein to polluters several democratic lawmakers including california rep maxine waters and new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez announced in advance of the speech that they would be skipping it with the high profile new york freshman tweeting that she would not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize trump s lawless conduct subversion of the constitution michigan gov gretchen whitmer was delivering the party s official response and in excerpts released ahead of the speech was to draw a contrast between actions taken by democrats and the president s rhetoric it doesn t matter what the president says about the stock market whitmer says what matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don t have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation student loans or prescription drugs ap writers darlene superville in washington

endured under trump there is also evidence that its durability has in recent years finally started to benefit a broader swath of americans more people have come off the sidelines and found jobs defying most economists predictions the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who are employed is now higher than before the great recession and last year wages rose

washington ap a portrait of a robust u s economy is sure to take center stage tuesday night when president donald trump gives his third state of the union address it is an economy that has proved solid and durable yet hasn t fulfilled many of trump s promises nine months before the election the economy keeps growing steadily if only modestly unemployment is at a half century low and consumers the lifeblood of the u s economy continue to spend average pay is rising faster than when trump took office three years ago with the largest percentage gains now going to lower wage workers some research has found that this trend which began in 2015 before trump s election partly reflects higher state minimum wages economists warn though that the u s expansion now in its record long 11th year faces an array of threats most immediately china s viral outbreak has paralyzed business with the world s second largest economy starbucks and apple have closed stores in china airlines have canceled flights and companies like general motors have halted production there all of that could shave one half percentage point off annual growth in the first quarter goldman sachs economists forecast though they expect the slowdown to be offset by a rebound in the second quarter boeing s decision to halt production of its 737 max should also weaken growth in the first six months of the year economists say america s manufacturing sector is struggling a reflection of trump s trade conflicts high corporate debt levels have sparked concerns some analysts also worry that the federal reserve s ultra low interest rates have helped feed risky bubbles in stocks or other assets and leading democratic presidential candidates especially sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built their campaigns to unseat trump around the message that the economy remains rife with inequality with many workers struggling to afford college housing or health care trump is unlikely on tuesday night to let any such doubts temper his standard message that under his stewardship the economy is thriving unemployment is falling the stock market is roaring and that the best days are still ahead i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before trump said last month in davos switzerland america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before yet what trump calls an unprecedented boom is by many measures not all that different from the solid economy he inherited from president barack obama economic growth was 2 3 in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of obama s eight year presidency during the 2016 campaign trump boasted that his tax cut plan would boost annual growth to 4 a year a brisk pace not seen since the late 1990 s instead trump along with obama is one of two presidents since world war ii not to have presided over a year of at least 3 growth and few economists think the economy will hit that target this year most analysts do think trump s tax plan helped accelerate growth just not the way he had promised the trump tax cuts were a sugar high that juiced the economy temporarily said ryan sweet an economist at moody s analytics it put more money in americans pockets boosting consumer spending the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 a healthy pace though the same as in 2015 the year before trump s election the administration had vowed though that the tax cuts would do more than just encourage americans to shop more the president s top economists had said the tax cuts would accelerate corporate investment in machinery computers and plants and office towers all the new equipment would make workers more efficient the argument went thereby boosting productivity the amount of output for each hour worked greater productivity is one of the two main drivers of growth the other is an increase in the number of u s workers both have slowed in the past decade most economists partly blame trump s trade wars particularly with china the trade conflicts have left american companies much less certain about the economic outlook and reluctant to expand and invest business investment shrank in the final three quarters of last year nor have trump s business tax cuts and deregulation made the economy more dynamic the growth of new companies has remained anemic since the 2008 downturn larger businesses continue to dominate many industries from technology to retail to finance all this is occurring despite significant stimulus trump has assailed fed chairman jerome powell for not cutting rates more though the fed s benchmark rate is now in a range of just 1 5 to 1 75 a very low level historically and one that is considered stimulative and increased federal spending has also helped support the economy the congressional budget office last week projected that the government s deficit will top 1 trillion annually for the next decade the accelerator is on the floor but the vehicle is moving surprisingly slowly larry summers treasury secretary under president bill clinton and a top economic adviser to obama said in early january trump has also recently highlighted what he calls a blue collar boom pointing to solid wage gains for lower paid workers and healthy hiring in construction and manufacturing but manufacturing jobs barely grew last year as factories hunkered down in the midst of the trade wars and since trump s inauguration manufacturing jobs have grown more slowly than employment overall has ernie goss an economics professor at creighton university in nebraska said the midwest s job growth has amounted to only about three quarters of the national pace since trump took office farmers have also suffered from the trade war he said as retaliatory tariffs by china have clobbered exports of soybeans and other commodities that in turn has hurt manufacturers of farm equipment including deere and caterpillar everyone says the economy is going great guns but that is everything except agriculture and manufacturing goss said what s more most campaign battleground states in the midwest such as michigan pennsylvania ohio and wisconsin have lost factory jobs in the past year most manufacturing job growth under trump s presidency has occurred in southern and western states said dean baker senior economist at the liberal center for economic and policy research with fewer union members in those states those factory jobs generally pay less in

poverty among children in a wealthy country like the united states however should summon shame and outrage as well unlike poor countries sometimes run by leaders more interested in lining their pockets than anything else what excuse does the united states have for its striking levels of child poverty after all it has the world s 10th highest per capita income at 62 795 and an unrivaled gross domestic product gdp of 21 3 trillion despite that in 2020 an estimated 11 9 million american kids 16 2 of the total live below the official poverty line which is a paltry 25 701 for a family of four with two kids put another way according to the children s defense fund kids now constitute one third of the 38 1 million americans classified as poor and 70 of them have at least one working parent so poverty can t be chalked up to parental indolence yes the proportion of kids living below the poverty line has zigzagged down from 22 when the country was being ravaged by the great recession of 2008 2009 and was even higher in prior decades but no one should crack open the champagne bottles just yet the relevant standard ought to be how the united states compares to other wealthy countries the answer badly it has the 11th highest child poverty rate of the 42 industrialized countries tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd winnow that list down to european union states and canada omitting low and middle income countries and our child poverty rate ranks above only spain s use the poverty threshold of the oecd 50 of a country s median income 63 178 for the united states and the american child poverty rate leaps to 20 the united states certainly doesn t lack the means to drive child poverty down or perhaps even eliminate it many countries on that shorter oecd list have lower per capita incomes and substantially smaller gdps yet as a unicef report makes clear have done far better by their kids our high child poverty rate stems from politics not economics government policies that since the 1980s have reduced public investment as a proportion of gdp in infrastructure public education and poverty reduction these were of course the same years when a belief that big government was an obstacle to advancement took ever deeper hold especially in the republican party today washington allocates only 9 of its federal budget to children poor or not that compares to a third for americans over 65 up from 22 in 1971 if you want a single fact that sums up where we are now inflation adjusted per capita spending on kids living in the poorest families has barely budged compared to 30 years ago whereas the corresponding figure for the elderly has doubled the conservative response to all this remains predictable you can t solve complex social problems like child poverty by throwing money at them besides government antipoverty programs only foster dependence and create bloated bureaucracies without solving the problem it matters little that the actual successes of american social programs prove this claim to be flat out false before getting to that however let s take a snapshot of child poverty in america sizing up the problem defining poverty may sound straightforward but it s not the government s annual official poverty measure opm developed in the 1960s establishes poverty lines by taking into account family size multiplying the 1963 cost for a minimum food budget by three while factoring in changes in the consumer price index and comparing the result to family income in 2018 a family with a single adult and one child was considered poor with an income below 17 308 20 2012 for two adults and one child 25 465 for two adults and two children and so on according to the opm 11 8 of all americans were poor that year by contrast the supplementary poverty measure spm published yearly since 2011 builds on the opm but provides a more nuanced calculus it counts the post tax income of families but also cash flows from the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc both of which help low income households it adds in government provided assistance through say the supplemental nutritional assistance program snap temporary aid to needy families tanf the children s health insurance program chip the national school lunch program nslp medicaid subsidies for housing and utilities and unemployment and disability insurance however it deducts costs like child care child support payments and out of pocket medical expenses according to the spm the 2018 national poverty rate was 12 8 of course neither of these poverty calculations can tell us how children are actually faring put simply they re faring worse in 2018 16 2 of americans under 18 lived in families with incomes below the spm line and that s not the worst of it a 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine study commissioned by congress found that 9 of poor children belong to families in deep poverty incomes that are less than 50 of the spm but 36 of all american children live in poor or near poor families those with incomes within 150 of the poverty line child poverty also varies by race a lot the rate for black children is 17 8 for hispanic kids 21 7 for their white counterparts 7 9 worse more than half of all black and hispanic kids live in near poor families compared to less than a quarter of white children combine age and race and you ll see another difference especially for children under five a population with an overall 2017 poverty rate of 19 2 break those under fives down by race however and here s what you find white kids at 15 9 hispanic kids at an eye opening 25 8 and their black peers at a staggering 32 9 location matters too the child poverty rate shifts by state and the differences are stark north dakota and utah are at 9 for instance while new mexico and mississippi are at 27 and 28 nineteen states have rates of 20 or more check out a color coded map of geographic variations in child poverty and you ll see that rates in the south southwest and parts of the midwest are above the national average while rural areas tend to have higher proportions of poor families than cities according to the department of agriculture in rural america 22 of all children and 26 of those under five were poor in 2017 why child poverty matters imagine for a moment this scenario a 200 meter footrace in which the starting blocks of some competitors are placed 75 meters behind the others barring an olympic caliber runner those who started way in front will naturally win now think of that as an analogy for the predicament that american kids born in poverty face through no fault of their own they may be smart and diligent their parents may do their best to care for them but they begin life with a huge handicap as a start the nutrition of poor children will generally be inferior to that of other kids no surprise there but here s what s not common knowledge a childhood nutritional deficit matters for years afterwards possibly for life scientific research shows that by age three the quality of children s diets is already shaping the development of critical parts of young brains like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in ways that matter that s worth keeping in mind because four million american kids under age six were poor in 2018 as were close to half of those in families headed by single women indeed the process starts even earlier poor mothers may themselves have nutritional deficiencies that increase their risk of having babies with low birthweights that in turn can have long term effects on children s health what level of education they reach and their future incomes since the quality of nutrition affects brain size concentration and cognitive capacity it also increases the chances of having learning disabilities and experiencing mental health problems poor children are likely to be less healthy in other ways as well for reasonsthat range from having a greater susceptibility to asthma to higher concentrations of lead in their blood moreover poor families find it harder to get good health care and add one more thing in our zip code influenced public school system such children are likely to attend schools with far fewer resources than those in more affluent neighborhoods our national opioid problem also affects the well being of children in a striking fashion according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 2008 and 2012 a third of women in their childbearing years filled opioid based medication prescriptions in pharmacies and an estimated 14 22 of them were pregnant the result an alarming increase in the number of babies exposed to opioids in utero and experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth which is also known as neonatal abstinence syndrome or nas in medical lingo its effects a penn state study found include future increased sensitivity to pain and susceptibility to fevers and seizures between 2000 and 2014 the incidence of nas increased by a multiple of four in 2014 34 000 babies were born with nas which as a cdc report put it is equivalent to one baby suffering from opioid withdrawal born approximately every 15 minutes given the ongoing opioid crisis it s unlikely that things have improved in recent years and the complications attributable to nas don t stop with birth though the research remains at an early stage the opioid crisis only began in the early 1990s it suggests that the ill effects of nas extend well beyond infancy and include impaired cognitive and motor skills respiratory ailments learning disabilities difficulty maintaining intellectual focus and behavioral traits that make productive interaction with others harder at this point you won t be surprised to learn that nas and child poverty are connected prescription opioid use rates are much higher for women on medicaid who are more likely to be poor than those with private insurance moreover the abuse of and overdose deaths from opioids whether obtained through prescriptions or illegally have been far more widespread among the poor combine all of this and here s the picture from the months before birth on poverty diminishes opportunity capacity and agency and its consequences reach into adulthood while that rigged footrace of mine was imaginary child poverty certainly does ensure a future rigged society the good news though not in donald trump s america the race to a half decent life or better doesn t have to be rigged it needn t be this way but will be as long as trump is president can children born into poverty defy the odds realize their potential and lead fulfilling lives conservatives will point to stories of people who cleared all the obstacles created by child poverty as proof that the real solution is hard work but let s be clear poor children shouldn t have to find themselves on a tilted playing field from the first moments of their lives individual success stories aside americans raised in poor families do markedly less well compared to those from middle class or affluent homes and it doesn t matter whether you choose college attendance employment rates or future household income as your measure and the longer they live in poverty the worse the odds that they ll escape it in adulthood for one thing they re far less likely to finish high school or attend college than their more fortunate peers conversely as harvard economist raj chetty and his colleagues have shown kids life prospects improve when parents with low incomes are given the financial wherewithal to move to neighborhoods with higher social mobility rates thanks to better schools and services including health care as in that imaginary footrace the starting point matters but here the news is grim the social progress index places the united states 75th out of 149 countries in access to quality education and 70th in access to quality health care and poor kids are of course at a particular disadvantage yet childhood circumstances can be and have been changed and the sorts of government programs that conservatives love to savage have helped enormously in that process child poverty plunged from 28 in 1967 to 15 6 in 2016 in significant part due to programs like medicaid and the food stamp act started in the 1960s as part of president lyndon johnson s war on poverty such programs helped poor families pay for housing food child care and medical expenses as did later tax legislation like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our own history and that of other wealthy countries show that child poverty is anything but an unalterable reality the record also shows that changing it requires mobilizing funds of the sort now being wasted on ventures like america s multitrillion dollarforever wars certainly an increase in jobs and earnings can reduce child poverty wall street journal odes to donald trump s tax cuts and deregulation policies highlight the present 3 5 unemployment rate the lowest in 60 years a surge in new jobs and wage growth at all levels notably for workers with low incomes who lack college degrees this storyline however omits important realities programs that reduce child poverty help even in years when poor or near poor parents gain and of course are critical in bad times since sooner or later booming job markets also bust furthermore the magic that trump fans tout occurred at a moment when many state and city governments were mandating increases in the minimum wage employers who hired especially in heavily populated states like california new york illinois ohio and michigan had to pay more as for cutting child poverty it hasn t exactly been a presidential priority in the trump years not like the drive to pass a 1 5 trillion corporate and individual income tax cut whose gains flowed mainly to the richest americans while inflating the budget deficit to 1 trillion in 2019 according to the treasury department then there s that impenetrable powerful beautiful wall its estimated price ranges from 21 billion to 70 billion excluding maintenance and don t forget the proposed extra 33 billion in military spending for this fiscal year alone part of president trump s plan to boost such spending by 683 billion over the next decade as for poor kids and their parents the president and congressional republicans are beginning to slash an array of programs ranging from the supplemental nutritional assistance program to medicaid 1 2 trillionworth over the next 10 years that have long helped struggling families and children in particular get by the trump administration has for good measure rewritten the eligibility rules for such programs in order to lower the number of people who qualify the supposed goal to cut costs by reducing dependence on government never mind the subsidies and tax loopholes trump s crew has created for corporations and the super wealthy which add up to many billions of dollars in spending and lost revenue these supposedly work ethic driven austerity policies batter working families with young kids that for example desperately need childcare which can take a big bite out of paychecks 10 or more for all households with kids but half in the case of poor families add to that the cost of unsubsidized housing median monthly rent increased by nearly a third between 2001 and 2015 put another way rents consume more than half the income of the bottom 20 of americans according to the federal reserve the advent of trump has also made the struggle of low income families with healthcare bills even harder the number of kids without health insurance jumped by 425 000 between 2017 and 2018 when according to the census bureau 4 3 million children lacked coverage even before donald trump s election only one sixth of eligible families with kids received assistance for childcare and a paltry one fifth got housing subsidies yet his administration arrived prepared to put programs that helped some of them pay for housing and childcare on the chopping block no point in such families looking to him for a hand in the future he won t be building any trump towers for them whatever make america great again may mean it certainly doesn t involve helping america s poor kids as long as donald trump oversees their race into life

bp earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 bp p l c bp 0 19 q4 2019 earnings call 4 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator welcome to the bp presentation to the financial community webcast and conference call i now hand over to craig marshall head of investor relations craig marshall group head of investor relations good morning everyone and welcome to bp s fourth quarter and full year results presentation for 2019 i m joined here today by helge lund chairman bob dudley group chief executive brian gilvary chief financial officer and bernard looney upstream chief executive and ceo designate before we begin i need to draw your attention to our cautionary statement during today s presentation we will make forward looking statements that refer to our estimates plans and expectations actual results and outcomes could differ materially due to factors we note on this slide and in our uk and sec filings please refer to our annual report stock exchange announcement and sec filings for more details these documents are available on our website now over to helge helge lund chairman good morning everyone i m helge lund bp chairman it s not usual for the chair to join these calls but i m going to make an exception today because it s bob dudley s last investor call for bp and his final day as chief executive after a 40 year career a nearly 10 at the top that s quite something bob is going to speak shortly but he is not a man given to self congratulation so i wanted to offer some reflections on his period as chief executive but first i should also acknowledge another announcement made last month brian gilvary has decided to step down too after 34 years with bp and eight as a cfo i hope brian won t mind me saying that he has been one of the truly great cfos but brian is going to be around until june we ll get some more value out of him yet and pay tribute properly when the time comes so back to bob bp today is very different to the bp of october 2010 when he took on the job the fact that bp is so strong today is in many ways because of bob s handling of that early period and his leadership sense his first task was not one to envy recovery from the deepwater horizon tragedy but bob quickly stabilized bp then he changed bp s culture instilled new values and helped make bp safer and profitable again i count that as the first great achievement of his leadership then there was the oil price downturn a big challenge for the whole industry bob made bp leaner and more modern and his phrase value over volume became a guide for the business and bp came out even stronger that was his second great achievement the third is bob s leadership into the energy transition he has invested in low carbon and positioned bp to dynamically drive the energy transition forward and of course that story is evolving and we re really excited for what bernard is going to do next so thank you bob for your leadership and for the position in which you leave bp you have our gratitude bob dudley group chief executive helge thank you for your kind words and good morning everyone as this is my last presentation to you as ceo i d like to break from the mold a little and spend a few minutes talking about bp s journey over the last period before handing over to brian to run through the results bernard is here today too and he will say a few words to close the presentation before brian and i take your questions looking back to the beginning of this decade bp was facing one of the biggest challenges in its history deepwater horizon was a tragic accident which shook bp to its core it was clear then that we needed to not only deal with the incident but also focus clearly on the future of the organization to do this we identified three key priorities for the group safety and operational risk management rebuilding trust and delivering value growth for our shareholders we have made many advances since then with these priorities defining the company we have become one that is well positioned to succeed as the world s energy system transition now a little more detail on each priority first safety and operational risk safety is a core value and we have done an enormous amount to make bp a safer place to work we have reinforced our safety and operational risk function putting in place systems and processes to improve our operations and performance this includes bringing together a set of global requirements under one operating management system along with our values of safety respect excellence courage and one team it defines how we work in a systematic way across bp we have also reshaped our businesses and embedded a functional model changing what it feels like to work for bp and externally we have changed and enhanced how we work with our partners and all of this has made a difference we have seen an almost 70 decline in tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events since 2011 and this year achieved our lowest ever recordable injury frequency both important successes we have however seen an increase in process safety events in 2019 mainly following some asset acquisitions this serves as an important reminder that we must remain steadfast in our focus on safety our aim remains the same to have no accidents no harm to people and no damage to the environment next rebuilding trust in bp at the time i said that the building of trust comes from doing what you say you re going to do and i believe we did that in meeting our obligations in the gulf not only were we quick to establish a clear process to meet our legal and financial commitments with the us gulf states and the federal government but we also applied rigorous standards to our work going above and beyond regulatory requirements in many regards we also implemented the lessons we learned across our operations globally and continue to share our learnings with others it was also important to rebuild trust in the decisions we were making about bp s future we had to find a way to move from response to recovery and to be clear and transparent in our communications so as some of you will recall in 2011 we laid out our 10 point plan it included five things you could expect from bp and five things to measure us by we were already in action on many of them but this plan clearly set out how we were going to move bp forward turning next to growing shareholder value which has always been a key priority and is based upon some guiding principles which have endured and evolved with the business over time value over volume taking decisions to maximize the value we can create rather than the volume we can produce active portfolio management and following an extensive divestment program much of which was delivered in an environment of over 100 per barrel our business looks very different we think carefully about the shape and scope of our global activities divesting parts of our portfolio where we don t see a clear strategic fit or where we believe others can create more value developing long term strategic relationships we see enormous value and long term mutual relationships with partners and governments particularly as we look to focus on key geographies and establishing strong value growth opportunities in the upstream this means driving growth from high quality major projects and optimizing our existing operations in the downstream accessing growth and marketing and advantage manufacturing to deliver strong underlying growth and returns and in alternative energy deploying bp s capabilities or partnering with others to grow in low carbon businesses and raise capital finally cost and capital discipline staying disciplined around our portfolio and investments with a relentless focus on capital cost efficiency these guiding principles have been and remain good for our business and core to our strategic decision making they served us well in the immediate aftermath of the gulf of mexico oil spill they provided a set of building blocks to support our recovery and delivery of our 10 point plan they ensured our business was resilient in the face of the oil price downturn and they created the foundation which along with a greater certainty of the gulf of mexico liabilities meant that in early 2017 we were able to lay out our new strategy for getting back to growth and so here we are today we have a powerful investor proposition of growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to our shareholders over the long term we are focused on running our operations safely reliably and efficiently which i truly believe is essential for the long term success of bp we have created a business that is fit for the future shaping a distinctive portfolio over the last decade that we believe is a well positioned frame to face the rapidly changing energy landscape and we will continue to be focused on value and returns making disciplined investment decisions while also managing our costs our proposition is underpinned by the five year growth strategy we laid out in early 2017 growing advantaged oil and gas in the upstream market led growth in the downstream venturing and low carbon across multiple fronts and modernizing the whole group in service of this we have built up our businesses in existing core regions and grown businesses in new markets we ve started up 24 major projects in the upstream since 2016 including shah deniz 2 together with the southern gas corridor one of the world s biggest engineering projects we significantly transform our downstream business and are accessing new growth markets such as mexico and india we re back into solar attracting lots of capital with fast growing lightsource bp we are in biofuels in brazil and we re fast charging vehicles in the uk in the us lower 48 we completed our biggest acquisition in 20 years we ve built distinctive partnerships around the world including with rosneft in russia reliance in india and aker bp in norway and reinforced strategic relationships with governments in places such as azerbaijan oman and abu dhabi across the group we are using technology to look for new ways to build and develop distinctive capabilities for our people and our operations all of this is in support of our proposition to grow sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term and we are doing just that having today announced a dividend increase bringing our dividend for the fourth quarter to 0 105 per ordinary share or 0 63 per adr in summary we are a global integrated energy business with a strong set of capabilities global reach and a talented workforce and i believe we are in a strong position to manage our business in this fast changing energy landscape so all that leaves me to do is to hand over to brian to take you through the results in more detail brian gilvary chief financial officer thanks bob and good morning everyone looking first to highlights from the year we are in the face of a challenging macro environment we ve delivered a strong set of results for the full year we reported underlying replacement cost profit of 10 billion with strong underlying operating cash flow of 28 2 billion including a working capital release of 300 million return on average capital employed was 8 9 and over the year we paid 8 5 billion in cash dividends and share buybacks i ll talk more on our financial results shortly but first let me share some strategic and operational highlights in the upstream we started up five major projects and took five final investment decisions in the year underpinning our 2021 target and our longer term growth options bpx energy is also making good progress delivering synergies this year of 240 million above the target of 90 million we ve planned well costs continue to decline in the eagle ford and permian under bp operations and we are progressing high value high impact activities as we continue to focus on value over volume in downstream we saw record refining throughput for the second consecutive year and continue to expand our retail convenience partnership model which is now in around 1 600 sites across our network in december we signed an agreement with reliance industries to form a fuels retail and aviation joint venture in india providing access to one of the world s largest and fastest growing energy markets we are also making progress in our advanced mobility agenda forming a joint venture with didi the world s leading mobile transportation platform to develop electric vehicle charging infrastructure in china the world s largest market for electric vehicles and since announcing our new plastic recycling technology bp infinia a consortium of leading companies has been formed to help accelerate commercialization leading to reduce plastic waste supporting the circular economy more broadly we are progressing our low carbon agenda in december we increased our stake in our solar joint venture with lightsource bp to 50 and completed the formation of bp bunge bioenergia a leading company in brazil s low carbon ethanol sugar and bio power market in summary 2019 was another year of strong financial delivery we are on track to deliver our 2021 targets and we continue to explore and develop new business models to provide opportunities through the energy transition turning then to the macro environment which remains volatile in 2019 brent crude averaged 63 per barrel in the fourth quarter and 64 per barrel for the full year oil prices were volatile through the year with supply and demand impacted by changing macroeconomic and geopolitical factors slowing demand growth was largely balanced by opec plus production cuts and the deceleration in us onshore production growth in recent weeks growing concerns over the potential impact of coronavirus on economic growth and global oil demand growth have also weighed on the oil price in the short term looking further into 2020 we expect stronger oil demand growth driven by improving global economic sentiment and the impact of imo 2020 stronger non opec supply growth driven by norway brazil and canada and solid us growth is expected to support global supply with opec plus continuing to be the balancing factor turning to gas us henry hub was 2 50 per million british thermal units in the fourth quarter down 1 20 versus a year ago it averaged 2 60 in 2019 down 0 50 from the 2018 average the us gas price has been impacted by continued supply growth a mild winter and softer demand growth than that seen in 2018 we expect price to be driven by the balance between continued supply growth versus supply disruption in light of the current challenging price environment finally bp s global refining marker margin was 12 40 per barrel in the fourth quarter 1 40 high versus a year ago and down 2 30 versus the third quarter for the year the refining marker margin remained largely unchanged yet 2019 was one of the worst refining environment since the financial crisis of 2008 with other crude and product differentials outside bp s rmm significantly impacted this was largely due to global tightening and temporary disruptions in heavy and sour crude supply implementation of imo 2020 should provide support to margins and widen heavy and sour crude oil differentials this year moving to our fourth quarter results bp s fourth quarter underlying replacement cost profit was 2 6 billion compared to 3 5 billion a year ago and 2 3 billion in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter the result benefits from a lower effective tax rate higher production due to improved weather in the gulf of mexico and strong commercial performance in refining this is partly offset by lower rosneft contribution following a strong third quarter and lower refining margins compared to a year ago the result was impacted by lower heavy crude differentials and lower liquid and gas realizations partly offset by lower effective tax rates and lower refinery turnarounds and as bob mentioned the fourth quarter dividend payable in the first quarter of 2020 has been increased to 0 105 per ordinary share turning to cash flow and our sources and uses of cash excluding oil spill related outgoings underlying operating cash flow was 28 2 billion for the year of which 7 6 billion was generated in the fourth quarter this included a working capital release of 300 million for the year and a build of 200 million in the fourth quarter organic capital expenditure was 4 billion in the fourth quarter and 15 2 billion for the year at the lower end of our targeted range turning to inorganic cash flows divestments under the proceeds in 2019 totaled 2 8 billion and we made post tax gulf of mexico payments of 2 4 billion inorganic capital expenditure was 4 2 billion including the final payments to bhp of 3 5 billion in the first half of the year gearing fell in the fourth quarter to 31 1 reflecting lower net debt partly offset by the impact of share buybacks on equity and impairments as of today we have completed our share buyback program fully offsetting dilution from the scrip dividend since the third quarter of 2017 in total we have repurchased 458 million ordinary shares at a cost of 3 billion a scrip dividend alternative is not being offered in respect to the fourth quarter dividend and we do not anticipate offering a scrip election for the foreseeable future now turning to guidance and the first quarter of 2020 in the upstream we expect reported production to be lower due to the impact of our ongoing divestment program and planned seasonal maintenance and turnaround activities while in the downstream we expect lower industry refining margins and wider north american heavy crude oil discounts turning to guidance for the full year 2020 upstream underlying production excluding rosneft is expected to be lower than 2019 i ll return shortly on that point organic capital expenditure is expected to remain toward the lower end of our 15 billion to 17 billion range the dd a charge is expected to be slightly below the 2019 level reflecting the impact of divestments we expect the other businesses and corporate quarterly charge to continue to average around 350 million the underlying effective tax rate is expected to be below 40 and gulf of mexico oil spill payments are expected to reduce to below 1 billion net of tax adjustments as usual we will provide updated rules of thumb for 2020 on price movements impacts for the year and expect to publish these on our website by the end of this month i will now provide some detail on the segments and progress toward 2021 cash flow target turning firstly upstream where we continue to make progress against our 2021 production and cash flow targets we ve delivered 24 major projects since 2016 including the december start up of the alligin field in the north sea these projects range in size scope and complexity and have on average been delivered on schedule and under budget they are currently producing around 700 000 high margin barrels a day we have 11 projects to go including our west nile delta raven project which is mechanically complete but is currently addressing issues identified during commissioning the project is now forecast to start up around the end of 2020 in addition we expect to start up three further major projects in 2020 projects in the gulf of mexico and north sea will leverage existing infrastructure while in india we expect start up of the first project in the kg d6 integrated development series and is eventually expected to contribute to over 10 of the country s projected gas demand our 2021 start ups are also on track ghazeer in oman is expected to come on stream in early 2021 and boost production by 500 million cubic feet per day and is currently ahead of schedule under budget and 90 complete other material projects including mad dog phase 2 and cassia compression are also progressing well with both around 65 complete in bpx energy we continue to focus on value over volume diverting investment from high volume lower margin gas production to higher margin oil production in the permian and eagle ford basins where we continue to ramp up activity we expect full year underlying production to be lower than 2019 due to declines in lower margin gas basins we expect reported production to be lower due to the above factor and the impact of the ongoing divestment program we estimate the impact of divestments to be in the range of 200 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day to 250 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2020 of this over half comes from lower margin onshore us gas production and much of the balance from lower margin oil so while we see 2020 as a transition year we remain confident in the delivery of 14 billion to 15 billion of pre tax cash in 2021 this is driven in large part by the expected delivery of around 250 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from major projects still to come relative to 2019 most of which is due in 2021 and our target of 1 billion of free cash flow from bpx energy supported by the ramp up of liquids production and the realization of synergies which we now expect to exceed 400 million by 2021 in the downstream we continue to make strong strategic progress toward our 2021 targets in 2019 earnings stood at 6 4 billion reflecting a further 1 3 billion of underlying earnings growth in 2019 and bringing total underlying earnings growth since 2016 to 2 3 billion this puts us firmly on track to deliver our target of more than 3 billion growth by 2021 while maintaining pre tax returns of around 20 moving to free cash flow 2019 pre tax cash was 6 5 billion at our planned conditions net of capital investments of 3 billion we remain on track to deliver 9 billion to 10 billion of pre tax cash by 2021 with the drivers of this growth being firstly a recovery of crude and product differentials which impacted our 2019 results by around 1 billion as i ve already mentioned last year was one of the worst refining environment we have seen since the financial crisis we expect differentials to widen and already see evidence of this in 2020 with north american sour crude and brent euros differentials back above our 2020 and 2021 planning assumptions partly reflecting the introduction of imo 2020 regulations second we expect lower turnaround levels in both 2020 and 2021 following record activity over the last two years as we optimize our schedule to capture opportunities in the imo 2020 changes and finally we expect further underlying earnings organic growth from each of our businesses in fuels marketing continue to grow our differentiated retail offer and scale up of our new market entries while developing ev positions across china uk and germany in refining delivering around 1 billion of further earnings growth over the next few years from our business improvement plans and digital operations in lubricants increasing growth market exposure and premium lubricants while diversifying into adjacent market spaces and dv products in petrochemicals selectively investing in attractive and growing market developing technologies to lead the market in circularity as with bp infinia across the downstream we have a strong track record of underlying earnings growth delivering more than 5 billion of earnings growth over the last five years looking forward we have a clear strategy with a focused activity set that underpins the growth momentum to 2021 this progress in the upstream and downstream gives us the confidence that we are on track to deliver our 2021 group targets we are staying disciplined with our capital and maintaining annual organic capital spend within a 15 billion to 17 billion range we remain confident that return on average capital employed will exceed 10 by 2021 applying conditions on divestments we have now announced 9 4 billion since the start of 2019 of the 10 billion package which we now expect to increase to 15 billion by mid 2021 net debt fell by 1 billion in the fourth quarter and with further proceeds received we expect net debt to continue to decline and gearing to move toward the middle of the range of 20 to 30 through this year assuming recent average oil prices in summary strong operational momentum is driving growing free cash flow we remain confident in delivering the 2021 free cash flow targets and divestment proceeds are expect to continue to reduce net debt and gearing taken together this underpins our announcement today of an increase in the dividend to 0 105 per share and our ongoing commitment to sustainably growing distributions to shareholders over the long term let me now hand over to bernard who will conclude today s presentation bernard looney chief executive upstream thanks brian i m conscious i m another voice in the room today and i won t talk for long but i wanted to be here for three reasons first it s been quite a year for bp and another strong year of strategic delivery and progress against the targets we have laid out for 2021 i m really proud of where bp is today we re in excellent shape secondly it s a time of change tomorrow is my first day in the job an opportunity i never foresaw 20 years ago when i joined bp but an opportunity i m obviously very excited about i look forward to talking and meeting with many of you in the coming weeks months and years and of course bob is stepping down as chief executive today i want to personally acknowledge bob and all that he has done for bp as well as the support he has given me over the years in many ways bp wouldn t be the company it is today were it not for bob and the leadership he has shown over the past decade he leaves bp with a strong foundation governed by a set of values and behaviors that define who we are and competing again with real strategic momentum and a focus on growing value i have some big shoes to fill as you are also aware brian has elected to retire and murray is set to take over at the start of july brian has been the key architect behind bp s financial framework and the progress we have made in this respect i m delighted he is staying on through the middle of the year and supported the transition and we will have a chance to acknowledge brian in the coming months the third reason i wanted to join the call was reassurance i want to reassure you of my personal commitment to some of our fundamental principles that are unchanged and will remain unchanged when we host our capital markets day later this year our commitment to safe and reliable operations our commitment to our investor proposition growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term our commitment to maintaining a strong financial frame including the absolute focus on deleveraging the balance sheet and importantly confidence in the delivery of our 2021 proxy free cash flow targets with capital discipline at its core i ll talk more about this in my broader ambition for bp going forward next week and beyond that we will start to work toward hosting the capital markets day we have a lot to do to get ready for that in the meantime let me close by thanking bob again for all he has done for this company bob we will miss you thank you for listening i m going to leave you in the capable hands of bob brian and craig to host the usual q a session and i look forward to talking with many of you on the 12th of february questions and answers operator craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you again everybody for listening good morning we re going to turn to questions and answers as usual if you can limit your questions to no more than two so everybody gets a chance to ask on that note let s take the first question from lydia rainforth at barclays good morning lydia lydia rainforth barclays analyst thank you and good morning and bob thank you to you as well i ve two questions if i could and the first one if i just think back over the last 10 years period of safety improvement that you talked about and then the modernization of bp are you surprised at how quickly the business was able to modernize and confidence that gives you about what can happen going forward and then the second question was a little bit more specific around the low carbon businesses that obviously we start to go back into how do you think about whether bp can make money and deliver competitive returns is it a case of looking at cost of capital for those business is in a slight different way thanks bob dudley group chief executive well thank you lydia and thank you for all of your good questions over the years your first one about safety and modernization i have to say if you were in the company it didn t feel like it was so quick because it s really been it was many years of small changes including shutting down our facilities around the world and turning them around and retooling things and getting the culture speaking up and measuring everything i think i don t think it was that quick but i think it was very very thorough and i think it s now firmly embedded in the culture and then with modernization i mean i do think we ve very early on embraced i mean sort of big words out there big data but we really did begin working with some great third parties to work on the big data which also combines of course with safety but also optimization of reservoirs and how we produce all kinds of things and this has been steady and it s accelerated in the second half of this last decade so thanks i think we do have a culture that is firmly got to tie on safety and always thinking about how to modernize things on the low carbon side we ve made some big steps we always even through the gulf of mexico retained our wind business retained and began the biofuels businesses we did move out of solar for a while and in some ways it s remarkable that we kept not only some of the businesses but all the talent around low carbon i think i hear people say well you only invest 3 of your capital on low carbon but this is where i think it would be good for many of you as you think about these business models like the one at lightsource bp which is 50 50 bp with lightsource acquiring and taking from one country to 10 countries and has attracted somewhere between 5 billion and 7 billion of capital in that business and we taken it around the world and you look at the economics of that i use solar for example in our operations which means we replace maybe burning gas that can be sold molecules for the country we re in so it s a you have to look at sort of corporate economics around it and i think we get better and better and better and more efficient bp bunge has got a great future the combinations in brazil 11 mills in a country that we ll use the ethanol and the sugar for all kinds of things so i think you re right there has to be good return on capital on it but let me ask brian to add to that brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah no i think that s a good summary bob and what i d say lydia the way we think about it at the moment is we will have in some respects just like we ve done through every energy transition as we re moving into new products and new sources of value we may do some of that off balance sheet which is what you ve seen around lightsource bp and bp bunge in terms of what we re doing bp bunge in terms of brazil equally things will come back on to the balance sheet at which point where we think there is a viable business going forward there is no question we ve seen a rapid move in the market over the last three or four years solar now is very economic and you can see that we will continue to see the investments in smaller ventures which will give us all sorts of information about how this energy market will transform and i d also remind you for example wind is currently on balance sheet sits inside our books and is very economic and makes a good return with the tax credits that come with it in the united states so i think it s looking for things which are complementary to what we do and moving things both off and on balance sheet as we go forward but i think it s a great time as bernard steps in i think it s a really exciting opportunity for us in terms of what some of those opportunities might look like lydia rainforth barclays analyst thank you very much craig marshall group head of investor relations thank you lydia we re going to take the next question from alastair syme at citi alastair alastair syme citigroup analyst good morning thank you everyone couple of questions one on the bpx business you previously talked about 1 billion of free cash flow up from this business by 2021 so i m just trying to figure out what the 2019 baseline is in that and how it gets bridged if you could help split between synergies and growth and my follow up is really just to ask about mauritania senegal there s a lot of exploration work in 2019 so i just wanted to get a status of where that asset is and when should we expect the next project to mature to fid thank you brian gilvary chief financial officer thanks alastair so i ll just pick up the first question around bpx everything is on track in terms of the 1 billion of free cash by 2021 activity we ve ramped down in the haynesville as we ve ramped up in the eagle ford and permian as more takeaway capacity comes through the synergy number we d now expect to be significantly higher than we first set and i think as i already laid out for you we re over 3 times the level we thought we d be at this point in terms of 2019 but everything is on track and the great thing about our new position we ve now pretty much sold out of all of the gas assets which is what you saw come through as the final impairment charge that we saw around those packages there is one small package left to do but pretty much everything is an around that the focus now for dave and the team is absolutely on the oil business and everything we see gives us confidence in that 1 billion but that s absolutely a promise that you should expect to see delivered next year and of course we have the flexibility through this year as to how we ramp activity up depending on what the price signals are that we see from the marketplace and it s worth just pointing out that on the gas side we ve seen something like a 40 drop across the sector in the gas rig count year on year and about 25 of all the gas you see in the united states comes from associated oil and that s started to taper off a little bit at the back end of last year but we will be able to ramp that activity up as opportunities arise alastair syme citigroup analyst brian can i just ask if the business if you strip out the acquisition cost if it was free cash positive in 2019 brian gilvary chief financial officer we wouldn t normally give you that specific level of detail alastair but we ll come back to you before the end of the call but we don t normally provide that it s a choice because it will ultimate the capital we did ramp capital down in 2019 to somewhere around about 2 billion that we talked about at 3q we were planning on something around close to 2 5 billion but i think it would be too early all the synergies will come through this year given where the run rate was as we exit this year and now we re expecting synergies somewhere close to 400 million so i would anticipate it will certainly be 1 billion surplus next year but we wouldn t normally give specific guidance around 19 bob dudley group chief executive and alastair this is bob on mauritania senegal those of you who know this project it s clearly got the potential to be a long term large integrated lng business with tens of tcf of gas have been discovered the fid which we announced in december 18 is in place the interstate cooperation agreements between the two governments of senegal and mauritania has been ratified the unitization has been ratified and the sales and purchase agreement for the lng should be coming along really any time now and the so phase 1 in execution the planned phases 2 and 3 which are progressing through their optimization right now so that project is on track i ve got a lot of faith in it alastair syme citigroup analyst great thank you very much craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thanks alastair we ll take the next question from os clint at bernstein os oswald clint sanford c bernstein analyst thank you good morning everyone yeah perhaps first question i just wanted to ask about the dividend i guess i walked away from 3q thinking gearing levels above 30 is a tough level to talk about the dividend hike in terms your board meeting so i just wondered if you could share a bit more color about what happened in this quarter s meetings surrounding the dividend and is it really just confidence in the 2021 delivery which brian has actually spoken to this morning but have you really interrogated all of the assumptions that underpin upstream and downstream delivery here because obviously there are some other companies out there that get 12 months away and start to worry about macro affecting their kind of end period targets that s the first question and then secondly and thank you very much bob for all your time over the last couple of years i wanted to ask you as we think about the value proposition with the reliance downstream marketing venture now from here if you could just perhaps reflect on the upstream reliance deal i guess you did it almost a decade ago if that deal delivered everything you thought it would if anything went wrong or slower and if there s any lessons learned that we should take from that and kind of transplant into the downstream venture thank you bob dudley group chief executive thanks oswald our partnership with reliance has been great i mean i made no secret about the fact that i was disappointed really with the indian government at that time for not sort of following through on what i would call the market gas pricing which was clearly part of the contract so it took some patience and perseverance however we ve since gone out and found more gas around there we just shut down the production facilities in d6 to be able to bring on now shortly march or april the new production for the satellite fields around it so significant production will come back on stream so that s all been really well engineered and cost effective program i think for the lessons learned there and i remain very optimistic about india as a country where you can argue that growth but roughly 6 growth i think in one of the largest countries in the world just beginning to travel in many ways we look at the downstream jv as not just one on liquid fuels but also mobility we ll take all the things that we re working on electrification of vehicles as well as liquid fuels marketing convenience marketing with a great partner who has all this wire broadband it up so that it will be fast and quick a lot of efficiencies because reliance is quite a talented company as well so we ll rebrand it it will be called jio bp which i m told in hindi means long life bp but it s a combination of course of the two companies the commitment is there we should close that deal here in the first half of the year brian gilvary chief financial officer and then coming back to the question on dividend os i mean i think a lot s changed between 3q and 4q around uncertainty in terms of the outlook vis a vis balance sheet i think firstly to start with we laid out you know the target in 2017 out to 2021 that had significant surplus free cash that s unified 6 billion over and above the 8 billion dividend that we have today and we moved on the dividend as part of that strategy in 2q 18 so we re in the sort of the right postcode in terms of timing around dividend the uncertainty around 3q i think what we ve seen through the fourth quarter is a major de risking of the uncertainty around balance sheet which investors have said quite clearly too is they re looking for us to de risk the balance sheet and i think the combination of a strong set of earnings in 4q strong operating cash in 4q we ve now announced 9 4 billion of the 10 billion package that we said we ll be doing over 19 and 20 so as a year a year early and only 2 8 billion of cash came in around that package in 2019 so the balance you d expect the majority of the balance with some payments out to 2021 to come through in 2020 we have also announced the further package of 5 billion which we expect to announce by the mid 2021 capex is at the low end of the range net debt came down by over 1 billion in the fourth quarter and one of the important measures was gearing came down from 31 7 at 3q down to 31 1 in spite of 2 billion of impairments associated with some of the lower 48 gas sales just shy of 2 billion so i think all of the outlook look far more positive the link back to macro we worry less about if you remember what we laid out in 2017 was a 55 a barrel brent real so we ve been in the sort of 60 65 range we ll come back to that in terms of what the macro outlook looks like there is no question coronavirus i suspect will impact demand this year we re currently seeing for the year something around 300 000 barrels a day to 500 000 barrels a day impact on demand growth that we were looking at around 1 2 coming into this year and of course that will unfold as the year progresses it may be more or less than that but that would be our current estimations and then the question will be whether opec balances or not but just reflecting on the last 10 years i mean it s sort of relevant i think vis a vis bob s tenure we ve dealt with oil prices that have gone from 100 a barrel to 28 a barrel so we have the flexibility to react what we laid out for you in 17 was the strategy out to 2021 where we d be able to manage the downsides and the upsides in the last two or three quarters certainly through last year we had the benefit of upside in oil prices oil prices may stay around 55 in the prompt right now given what we re seeing around coronavirus but they may regrow back by the end of the year but i think we ll see how that plays out but from our perspective there is no question now you can see probably somewhere in the range of 7 billion to 9 billion of cash from divestment proceeds coming through this year if you think about the balance of 6 6 billion of the 9 4 billion we ve already announced say 40 of the balance of the 5 billion to come through maybe this year it sort of says the backdrop is positive and we ve got growing free cash flow out to 2021 and so i think when we look to that in the round especially the strong set of 4q results and the further 5 billion package that we announced was sufficient to justify the dividend move now oswald clint sanford c bernstein analyst excellent thank you thank you both craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you os we ll take the next question from irene himona irene good morning irene himona societe generale analyst good morning thank you and bob congratulations on a job well done and all the best for the future so i had two questions first of all 2019 reserve replacement 67 i wanted to ask is this metric as relevant to bp these days as it used to be are you striving consciously to replace reserves in a world where there is an energy transition and we are looking at peak oil at some point so how should we think of bp s exploration effort and future reserve replacement ambitions and then my second question for brian so in q4 underlying tax 27 and for the full year 35 5 so well below your guidance and indeed as we saw in q3 well below your expectations and i think you attribute that in the press release to lower deferred tax can you just help us understand what were the key drivers let s say the key unanticipated drivers that led to such a discrepancy between your expectations and the actual for the year thank you brian gilvary chief financial officer so maybe if i just take the tax question first it was indeed deferred taxes and actually in q3 remember we talked about we were expecting taxes to be very high the big change is the mix and if you look at it yeah we just gone now and look what do we think the tax will look like for 2020 of course we ve got big swings in profit mix in terms of downstream to upstream and then within the upstream depending on what prices are doing so it s really hard to try and come up with an estimate ahead of time we started to give guidance along the lines we did when we did the abu dhabi deal because of course the high tax barrels that come with that which moved our overall tax rate up from a long term historic level of about 32 to something north of 40 we ve done the roll up now for next gen we ve tried to give you guidance here that it s somewhere probably below 40 next year i would say the range about where we ve actually come out this year around 35 36 to 40 is a sort of good range number but there is such a huge swing irene in terms of the balance of profits between upstream and downstream and the tax characteristics of those the big difference in 4q was really around deferred taxes specific assets that roll forward and of course you ve also got the impacts of some of the impairments as well that come through that move the tax number around but even at the end of 3q we wouldn t have anticipated tax to be as low as it has come through in the fourth quarter bob dudley group chief executive thanks brian and thank you irene thank you for your comment as well on reserve replacement ratio we have focus for some time now and value over volume but a year or so ago we removed reserve replacement ratio from our compensation metrics over the last five years we ve had a rolling average of 97 in terms of reserve replacement ratio this last year 67 a little lower we had fewer major development sanctions than typical in 2019 than we ve had in the past the reserves are still healthy our reserve production ratio rp ratio still just around 14 years but i think the idea of being driven for just reserve replacement ratio is not how we will drive bp going forward it doesn t mean we re not going to though add reserves we still have a whole set of projects out going on we can see till 2025 but i feel that it s the kind of reserves you add whether it s gas advantage oil advantage gas got to be a key and that s i m sure will drive our project sanctions irene himona societe generale analyst thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations thanks irene we ll take the next question from jon rigby at ubs jon good morning jon rigby ubs investment bank analyst hi good morning yeah thank you and to drill down on that reserve replacement question little bit i noticed exploration charge both the write off of carry forward and also the activity in the quarter has been dropping it looks now like a pattern maybe two to three years so i just wondered is that reflective of some strategic decision making around what you want to do around exploration and then the second question is you ve had a couple of i think comparatively in comparative quarters some very good trading results or you don t call it out this quarter but i do notice that your inventory run by rmi is quite high for 4q in absolute terms and if relative to the oil price very high so i just wondered whether you able to characterize what you were doing and whether that is reflective of activity in the fourth quarter around trading thanks brian gilvary chief financial officer okay jon i ll take the trading question first yeah rmi was driven up is actually by higher volumes that we were carrying through the year end and by higher prices so that s pretty much and that will swing around depending on activity but we were carrying higher volumes through the end of the year in terms of performance of the business it was a strong quarter for gas it was a more probably below average certainly and below plan for the fourth quarter for trading for oil which is really the big swings that we saw in the last sort of 10 15 days of the quarter but overall for oil trading and gas trading they both had record years in 2019 and certainly a strong set of results as we ve seen in recent years and certainly over the last decade so a lot of things went in the right direction some quarters were stronger some were weaker for each of them but overall it s been a busy year for the trading business but the rmi activity was really about volumes and it s about higher prices bob dudley group chief executive and jon you were asking yeah drilling down on exploration i mean we are still clearly continuing to explore we ve drilled exploration wells this year two of them in egypt gulf of mexico four of them in trinidad we ve had three announced discoveries so far this year we ve got whole plan of exploration going on forward and in terms of fids we see about 10 projects in 20 and 21 that we would consider fid coming down the pipe we haven t announced which projects exactly but they are spread across the world and go into the gulf of mexico trinidad and we ve got in 20 and then we ve got about seven others that move around from angola to the north sea australia senegal couple in the gulf of mexico and maybe one in egypt so we will continue to explore i m not sure if that exactly got to your question jon rigby ubs investment bank analyst it was really just whether this is just a reoptimizing of risk as you sort of enter into the 2020s and kind of how you apply your capital to exploration but i think that captures it thank you and just also to add my thanks to you for the past 10 years and good luck in the retirement brian gilvary chief financial officer well thank you jon and i ll just add to that to your point yes we will recharacterize exploration and risk and think about exploration combined with access which often doesn t necessarily require exploration drilling we ve been steadily reducing our exploration now for a number of years and we will keep doing that we ll focus a lot on as you all know ilx or infrared let exploration in our existing businesses focusing around where we already have the facilities most certainly thanks jon jon rigby ubs investment bank analyst thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you jon we ll take the next question from chris kuplent at bank of america chris chris copeland bank of america analyst thank you very much and can i just echo bob and brian thank you for all your help over the years just two two quick questions i hope the 2020 production outlook you ve given of course our production will be impacted by disposals but you already pointing at an underlying decline as well and you were referring to low gas margin basins does that refer explicitly to bpx or others as well so any bit of color would be would be helpful and secondly a bit of a wider question you said you completed the buyback program what do you see the role of buybacks within your progressive distribution policy going forward thank you bob dudley group chief executive okay chris if i just take the first part of that reported production i think we ve said already today you will see about 200 000 250 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that we ve disposed out of the asset base so you ll see that come through this year which is why reported is lower in terms of underlying you ve got lower activity in haynesville so you think from a value of a volume perspective that s a good thing so the rig count stands i think just one rig or two rigs i think it s about one rig now then haynesville so that will be lower underlying production there were lower volumes coming out of trinidad to do with some infill wells we have and of course you ve also got the impact of raven being delayed out to the back end of this year from last year which we would have anticipated as part of the in line growth this year but they are the three major drivers of why the underlying number will be slightly down in terms of distributions the buyback is now complete in terms of what the script that we ve issued since the third quarter 2017 so that was a big signal which i probably should have alluded to earlier having that also behind us i mean there is two things which have helped with the balance sheet there is completing the buyback which i think there has been good we promised to do that and we ve done it and the second thing of course is deepwater horizon payments are now down to below 1 billion a year around 1 billion a year post tax out to 2032 so that s taken a big piece of risk off the balance sheet in terms of further buybacks i think all option is wrote within the financial frame especially given where the equity value sit today there is no question that s an attractive proposition but that s really one for the broader financial frame conversation with the board as we progress through this year and bernard will lay out next week his ambition for the company going forward but i think buybacks will always be an opportunity in terms of our armory of things we can do around distributions especially when we think the equity value of the company is significantly over valued above where we see the market trading chris copeland bank of america analyst okay thank you bob dudley group chief executive thanks chris craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you chris we will take the next question from thomas adolff at credit suisse thomas thomas adolff credit suisse analyst good morning two questions from me as well please firstly a few years ago you had a number of gaps in your upstream portfolio and they included the permian and brazil and subsequently you filled them i was wondering if you can give us an update on brazil it s gone quiet somewhat and whether you re overall happy with the portfolio you have today obviously suriname and guyana seems to be getting quite hot and then secondly on russia bob you have a very long history working in russia starting with amoco then with tnk bp and then of course today with bp and rosneft and i understand that this partnership with rosneft is very important to you and you emphasized the importance of partnerships and relationships on today s call and i m not sure if bernard is on the call for the q a but if he is i was wondering whether bernard can talk to us about the strategic rationale to have this stake in rosneft and what it brings to bp and whether it differentiates your investment proposition thank you bob dudley group chief executive thomas i ll comment on brazil and then russia and let brian also add to that so in brazil we ve we re happy we ve got a very big integrated business now in brazil it s not only the exploration side but we ve got biofuels air bp the jet fuel trading operations and supplying and working with a power plant there for the use of gas on the exploration side we ve got some good acreage yet to be drilled we had first well back in the first quarter of 19 it was a disappointment we ve been very very careful in terms of adding to that i think that we ll see exploration not sure we have stepped back from some of the programs here like the transfer of rights programs there because it just looked pricey for us so we re going to be very very capital disciplined about what we re doing there but it s obviously a great province for energy going forward on russia i ll just say russia is really important to bp i ll let brian give a perspective so that you know it s not just mine because brian or bernard is not here although of course we ve talked to bern obviously over the years to me it is a great partnership it s been a hard one and it s strategic i think it s got enormous optionality not only just for the shareholding in rosneft but also the joint venture projects that we ve worked with and are working and producing from with rosneft but brian brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah no i mean we ve been in russia for over 30 years the current version of that looks very positive from bp s perspective rosneft is probably one of our deepest most important strategic relationships bob has built that up over time i was on the tnk board myself for the best part of 10 years so i know a lot about russia and the challenges and the opportunities which have come with it i think we think about russia strategically in terms of rosneft and that relationship you have to remember because it s some i mean i think there was some commentary at the weekend about linking this to climate change and to energy transition i d just remind people that russia is signed up to the paris climate accord they are doing a lot in terms of the energy transition they ve also signed up to the un sustainability goals and they re one of the largest oil and gas provinces in the world so i think it is incredibly important for bp that we continue to deepen that relationship that we have today and i think the things that bob and the team have been able to do in terms of and with bernard the additional joint ventures we now have on the ground as bp in places like taz which are now generating revenues and production for us and i d also say while the ownership of rosneft is an investment in the company and that pays us a dividend that dividend underpins 10 of our own dividend and is very important for us going forward so i think and than usual report the idea that rosneft will be non strategic for us in this next decade i ve got absolutely no founding at all and we just still see it as a very important relationship going forward and i think i can probably say on the call if bernard was here he was in russia in the last few weeks to cement those relationships going forward bob dudley group chief executive and i would for those you and many of you maybe don t follow rosneft but it s worth looking at because that company is transforming itself it s a little bit like as tnk changed over the years the emphasis on safety efficiency modernization reductions of corrosion base lining their flaring and greatly reducing their flaring they are doing all the right things that you would expect and so i think it s it s a company that is slightly constrained because of the opec plus agreements but they ve got developments down the road great projects ahead of it and so it s not just a passive investment we work closely with them on all fronts thomas adolff credit suisse analyst great thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you thomas we ll take the next question from jason kenney at santander jason jason kenney santander analyst hi good morning and thanks for the opportunity well all the best for your retirement i m looking forward to the book of your time associated with bp should be fascinating if every year in embra definitely is available i ve got a couple of questions firstly what s happening in iraq i think the kirkuk expansion plans have stalled and any insights as to where you think that can go over the next five 10 years would be interesting and then secondly on the recycling start ups the position you re taking with unilever and danone to look at recycling at plastics what kind of scale do you think that can grow to and over which geographies in the next decade or so thanks bob dudley group chief executive thanks jason i think i ll take you up on the v dram i m not sure about the book i don t think i read through your book but i d like to say i think there s a lot of things in your question there so kirkuk in iraq i would say kirkuk is in hibernation for us we ve stopped we ve done a lot of work there it s a big field it s in quite tricky geography and sort of stands between northern iraq or kurdistan and southern iraq and the differences between the companies to me someday kirkuk will be some sort of key to solving some of the political or maybe being a union point politically but just not now for bp the southern fields rumaila continue to operate safely with lots of vigilance there we still have staff there and that s going fine rumaila is just a key field for the iraqi government supplies about 40 of the money to their treasury but on kirkuk i think i would stay tuned but it s going to be a long way i think now on recycling brian you are working with that brian gilvary chief financial officer yes sure and i think it s thanks for asking the question actually had a somebody from another chemical company talked to me recently about it about how impressed they were with this i mean this is a big breakthrough it s a technology bp infinia that processes polyester plastics particularly items that are difficult to recycle today and the consortium we put in place includes exactly companies like you ve said to known unilever britvic the packaging recycling specialist is in there as well in terms of our plan and remind us in terms of the management recycling specialists in terms of dealing with the recycling side of this i think it s a massive opportunity it s something like 25 million that we re putting into a plant in naperville that will test out the technology and then we ll look in terms of full scale commercialization optimization i think it s a huge opportunity for us it is that the pilot plant stage that we ll be looking to build this to sort of see if we can make this commercial but i think in terms of if you think about all the things we ve talked about in the venture space this is an example of a technology we developed in house that could have major potential scale up but it s really too early to say at this point but all the indications are very positive and if you look at the consortium we ve put together and the sort of brands that we re talking about and i think that will gives you an indication of just what the potential might look like so it s a great example of technology in action within the business and coming from not the areas that we would normally talk about but if you think about the circularity economy to underpin the circularity economy that s a big part of it jason kenney santander analyst thanks craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you jason i ll take you up on your dram as well let s move to christian malek at jpmorgan christine christian malek jpmorgan analyst thanks craig it s great to finally see the dividend raise and even better to see that s on a 55 per barrel breakeven for 19 so with that in mind to what extent will be continuing to focus on delivering a lower cash breakeven to stay competitive within the macro frame that continues to be volatile and how should we think about the critical path to raise dividends further given you ve chosen to raise even with the gearing is above 30 still secondly a question on scaling up new energies in capital investment what i appreciate is much to look forward to presenting the policy carbon knife i m just not sure how to solve for that effectively working and investing more in non oil energy solutions while gearing does remain so high and with a higher dividend going forward do you think bp has a capital frame to really drive a realistic plan to invest materially in clean energy or is wholly dependent on your success of divestments so do we need a massive portfolio reshaping is basically what i m asking i m sorry to make a third apologies but i just want to echo comments to thank you for your graciousness and humility in helping guide us through some very challenging times two qualities that are greatly if i may be permitted to say while we still have it would be great if you could share what were the lessons learned from the 10 year bp and advice it gives in new management team and this community especially concerns around the future fossil fuels continue to mount thank you brian gilvary chief financial officer thanks christian so first on the dividend and i think just to make it clear it was a move in seeing the trajectory of the gearing coming down to the fourth quarter that allowed us to make the move gearing has stayed up where it was or even gone higher off the back of the equity write offs i think its going to be a more difficult decision if you look through though something in the tune of 7 billion to 9 billion of cash coming through this year in deals that we re pretty much done or we re fairly confident we ll get done through this year on a risk basis and the fact the capex the bottom end of the 15 million to 17 million range that we set for 2021 we have majorly de risked the balance sheet coming into this year which i think gave the board the confidence to move the dividend the way we have in the fourth quarter the breakeven of 35 to 40 a barrel still holds true for 2021 in terms of the targets of course it moves toward 40 the more that we distribute now through dividends of course that s a measure based on where how much dividend you paid out so now we re paying out a high dividend we re not issuing scrip you move toward the top end of that range obviously as we start to distribute but now this year we will be somewhere around mid 50s breakeven for the corporation remember deepwater horizon which was 19 billion of cash was paid out over the last four years we ve absorbed 10 billion or 10 25 billion purchase of bhp in total at 30 billion of cash over the last four years and certainly the 10 billion over the last couple of years i think we re in a very positive position vis a vis where the balance sheet is and the trajectory through the first and second quarter this year so i think that does give us confidence 2021 looks well underpinned and we did premise that 2021 targets around further distribution to shareholders so i think we have a much clear runway vis a vis the things that we can control the thing we can control of course is the environment and as you saw through 15 16 17 we have a company that is flexible enough to deal with that in pretty much all the scenarios that you could sell to paying down craig marshall group head of investor relations thanks brian and christian thank you for your kind comments there and i ll maybe just a few things to think about in terms of lessons and you all cover energy and oil and gas which i think is one of the world s longest wavelength investment cycles so that s what we are working in and i think some of the things around that is because they are such long term they do i do think of bp we do relationships not transactions because it s essential in such a long wavelength business some lessons learned and you all will know this culture is critical in any company in almost any industry and in our case safety discipline around what we do and being a good partner it s just really important and i think patience and perseverance in almost any difficult time step by step there are no silver bullets and not allowing anyone to believe that there is a silver bullet in it this is very important and i just noticed that today one thing i m always struck by in terms of investing i always go back to the fundamentals and i would say right now we re in a world where sentiment seems to be more important than the fundamentals and i think in reality always have to get back to the fundamentals including in the new energy transitions and how we do it to maintain a successful long company that continues with its shareholder distributions and one thing i always learned i learned it the hard way actually in russia but all of us in the company our shareholders ourselves so we need to learn to make sure we spend the company s money as if it s your money and shareholders and that s a fundamental thing we ve tried to drive in our own employees but kind of rambling now christian so next question bob dudley group chief executive and christian just to finish off on your question around capital frame i think 2021 is underpinned we ve got 15 billion to 17 billion frame toward the bottom end of that range now given the capital efficiency the bernard and marine the team have been driving in the upstream in particular and i think you ll see more to follow on that next week bernard will come out with his ambition for the company of the next phase of what that will look like that will then set a frame in a direction for probably a capital markets day at the back end of this year where we then talk about 2025 targets and what the capital frame looks like around that but i think certainly without wishing to see i think more you know more of the same on capital discipline is almost certainly coming as he talks about the future craig marshall group head of investor relations great thank you christian thanks for the questions we ll take the next question from martijn rats at morgan stanley martijn martijn rats morgan stanley analyst yes hi hello and also for me a congratulations with the successful and very long standing career and i appreciate all the guidance over the last couple of years i had two very short questions can you brief on the raven project i understand it s a year delayed but could you elaborate a little bit sort of why that is because this was a project that was sort of reiterated to be reiterated to be on track for start up in 2019 so a bit more color would be appreciated and the second thing i wanted to ask is about the us so bpx the 4q 18 over 4q 19 still showed about a 10 decline in production cost per barrel and i was wondering if you could comment on your ability to continue to drive cost there or whether we should expect the return of some inflation in the us shale patch that ll be much appreciated thank you bob dudley group chief executive thanks martijn and maybe just on raven i know if bernard was here he would tell you how disappointed he is and the team are and it s couched in the what has been a really good run three or four years of projects coming in below cost on budget and in some cases ahead of schedule this one is delayed this delayed significantly and it s pretty much a function of some corrosion issues that we ve picked up as part of the commissioning it s going to take longer to resolve than we would have liked bernard himself has talked about it and how this a point of view is in where we are nevertheless it won t impact 2021 which i think is important it s going to affect 2020 obviously but we should be able to get full ramp by as we commission toward the end of this year into 2021 so the 2021 targets are underpinned but it s effectively around some corrosion issues around the installation that we have and the team have to deal with and then in terms of bpx activity as i said earlier we are on track in terms of delivering 1 billion of surplus free cash we ll give you a bigger update on the first quarter around where we are around the next phase of synergies there is no question that we ll see more costs cost reductions coming in as part of that synergy number but i think 1q will give us a chance to give you an update more fully on where we are with bpx now that we ve got activity ramping in terms of the eagle ford and permian less so in haynesville as i said earlier martijn rats morgan stanley analyst all right thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations okay we ll take the next question from lucas herrmann at exane lucas lucas herrmann exane analyst good afternoon good morning bob and brian just to reiterate the comments of others thanks very much bob to help guide these persistent over the years two modest questions if i might the first was just typically this time if you could give us a better idea of what s going on in the fuels retailing business where in a profit might have been so really just if you could disclose what the full year break out of numbers in that business were and secondly i just wondered if you could comment on the lng trading business at all not least given the stock report and incremental volumes that you ll start to see the extent to which those volumes and the volumes are effectively underpinned by forward sales into end markets that s it thank you bob dudley group chief executive yes so in terms of lng you know we ran the portfolio it s about two thirds equity one third merchant or commercial no significant equity volumes to come on this year other than the ramp up of existing lng that we have so it s really around the short term loans that we have we ve got some exports coming out of the united states if they flow at these levels i think what you re going to see in the first half of this year coming out of mall winter lucas in the states the prices going to remain pretty soft at the levels that we see today we think that will clear up by the time we get to the sort of back end of this year so you ll start to see some underpinning on the gas price but i think we re pretty much held a position which is that we were pretty breakeven third quarter we talked about this been pretty bearish gas prices certainly through 2020 and the question is do you start to recover in 2021 or 2023 given the two effects of gas being backed up in the united states and big lng projects around the world coming on where we will be moving some of those volumes to our merchant business but i think you re lng is all about in terms of lng trading it s all about the optionality and making sure that we retain those options with different price points that allows the team to optimize the way they have and had a very successful year last year brian gilvary chief financial officer and thanks lucas a few things on the downstream we ve had a good track record of growth 2019 earnings were 2 7 billion pre tax returns of more than 30 plans are to grow earnings by another greater than 1 4 billion from 2016 to 2021 i mean really our focus is on the differentiated retail it s the most material part of the fuels marketing we try to develop strong market positions the brand the distinctive offers the retail network has grown quite a bit we ve had 1 2 billion in non fuel gross margin as well we re up over 10 million customers a day we ve got a 20 premium fuel volumes growth since the active fuels were launched last spring or in the spring of 2016 we have built up these strategic convenience partnerships like we have m s in the uk and others in germany and the netherlands 1 600 of those by the end of 19 we ve got 1 250 retail sites in new markets such as mexico indonesia and china we ve got over 520 in mexico and more than doubled the volumes in 2019 so these are working well mexico has really been a success as that despite what you think about what s happening in the country that has been very successful and then of course in december of 19 we signed the agreements with reliance to form that big fuels retail and aviation jv across india which immediately on closing will provide about 1 400 1 500 sites that we hope to grow to 5 500 across the highways of india over the next five years so i could go on with things lucas herrmann exane analyst sorry to interrupt and to push in terms of the financials coming out bottom line either what typically would have broken out a number of this year or the performance of the retail business as in split from refining i think last year it was 2 8 billion of ebit do you have a number for this year or should i talk to ir later brian gilvary chief financial officer lucas you can pick it up later but i think there is continued underlying growth in ebit it s coming out of places like mexico where we are still growing the new market entry there but we ll come back we ll circle back at the end of the call the actual figure at the moment around 2019 i think the cumulative now is some think north of 0 5 billion for this year but will need to come back and confirm that which will be through ir lucas herrmann exane analyst okay that s great thank you and thanks for everything again craig marshall group head of investor relations thanks lucas okay we ll take the next question from peter low at redburn peter peter low redburn analyst hi thanks for taking my question you re guiding to capex being at the lower end of the 15 billion to 17 billion range again in 2020 is that a decision you ve taken based on the current commodity price environment and can you perhaps give us some color on why the flex has come from i e why have you chosen to the rephase or the first you could have done thanks brian gilvary chief financial officer i mean i think actually look this is more of the same in terms of bernard and upstream if you remember when we set up 2021 targets upstream had a range of 13 billion to 14 billion of capital which you know it s always hindsight of wonderful thing but back in 17 we would have anticipated by now would be at the top end of the range what we ve been doing in the upstream particular is continuing to drive capital efficiency capex in 19 was down to below 12 billion in upstream set against 13 14 we set it s about capital efficiency i think as you see bernard go from chief executive upstream to chief executive company you re going to see more drive on capital efficiency i think bernard would say we will see it is more that can be done in the upstream so the actual summation of where we ve come out even having absorbed the capital now for bhp and the bhp bpx transaction that we did that will comfortably be down toward the bottom end of the range and in some respects that s not so much set by the macro it s a function of where we are in terms of the sort of 12 quarters into the 20 quarter strategy and it creates some flexibility from a risk perspective if we see a series downside to the oil price over the next six to nine months depending on what happens with coronavirus so i think it s the it s a conservative assumption i think it s the right assumption but we are continuing to see continued deflation in the upstream as we go forward peter low redburn analyst very clear thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations peter thank you we ll take the next question from henry tarr at berenberg henry henry tarr berenberg analyst hi thanks for taking my question and just a couple so one back on the refining environment i think you talked about the improving of the underlying environment hopefully through the rest of this year what would you need to see for that to come through i guess imo is not yet played out as somewhat i thought and it looks to be kind of too much capacity currently in both pet chems and refining so how confident are you that we ll see an improvement there over the coming quarters and then just secondly on divestments given the challenging environment and how easy how it been to strike deals and i guess you ve got the further 5 billion as we look into 2021 are there any sort of areas specifically where you re looking where you think there is interest around divestments thanks brian gilvary chief financial officer so let me pick up the divestments first because a big chunk of it was the purchase of bpx is bhp assets and the selling off of bpx is all dry gas the difficult assets to sell has been the lower 48 gas assets were pretty much now done with those and there s been less issues in selling the balance of midstream downstream upstream assets certainly upstream in terms of oil linked as you ve seen in the north sea in the fourth quarter so less of an issue with those we ve now done 9 4 of the 10 is announced the balance will come very shortly and then we ve got another 5 billion package the 5 billion package is going to be a mix of upstream downstream midstream so it s across the piece and there ll be some portfolio options in terms of less price sensitive things that we can do inside that 5 billion so very confident and i think look our m a team i think their track record now must be somewhere up to 75 billion to 80 billion if not 85 billion of disposals over the last decade so we have a pretty hot very well tuned machine and it s been particularly well tuned through 2019 as it had to deal with some of the private equity that we had to deal with in terms of lower 48 gas that won t be an issue i believe going forward in terms of refining margins actually we are starting to see more pulp kick in i mean it s now active this year takes effect march 1st it came into enactment this year people after all had to do deal with scrubbers use 0 5 sulfur or switch to lng in terms of its use but i think that will underpin margins this year and we re seeing that you re going to have to start to see some of these stocks clear out one of the things particularly you need to be paid of course is the light heavy spread and we will see the benefits of that effort whiting where it s up over 20 a barrel and i think it average somewhere close to 12 a barrel last year or certainly below 12 a barrel so i think that will from our position is a bp s position in terms of light heavy will help but you re right there are some stocks to clear out before we start to see that recovery but marpol definitely in terms of distillate is underpinning the market right now bob dudley group chief executive i think i would add as a footnote as we look at the scheduled turnarounds around the world and where our refineries are we have very few coming up and others do so we ll have a it looks like a pretty straight through period of uptime brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah that s actually but that s really important point 2q is going to be a high turnaround quarter i think for the industry we ve done most of ours in the last two years so we will have a relatively low turnaround year this year henry tarr berenberg analyst great thanks and i wish you both the best of the future craig marshall group head of investor relations thank you henry okay we ll take the next question from jason gammel at jefferies jason jason gammel jefferies llc analyst thank you craig and bob may i just add my best wishes to you for all your future endeavors bob you ve taken over essentially leadership on bp s strategy for the energy transition and i was hoping you can just leave us with some thoughts on what you think bp needs to do to be successful in the energy transition and maybe even any high level milestones that we should be looking for out of bp and then my second question is on the divestiture the incremental divestitures that were announced today just give us some details on that and i know you don t want to identify specific assets but does carbon intensity of the assets play a large role in your decision on whether to put them up for sale or not really kind of thinking particular canadian oil sands brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah i ll just pick up the second part of that question to say that value of volume is what determines everything we do in strategy we already deploy a carbon price across our whole portfolio when we look at investments that s taken into account it s 40 a ton and we stress test up to 80 a ton so in some respects that s already built into our valuation as we think the carrying value of these assets going forward so i think i won t specifically point to any asset which you wouldn t expect me to but it is very much driven by strategy and think about value over volume in terms of portfolio going forward bob dudley group chief executive yes jason thank you very much for your remarks and thanks for some you say in the paper it is gratifying i think the thing as we go forward we have completely reestablished what we re doing in the low carbon world lightsource bp as a business model is quite unique and different that i think has clearly grown and been successful and it attracts a lot of capital that we might not see coming into oil and gas projects and i don t think we get the credit for that it s going to continue to grow i think bp bunge is another one it s the business models that are different i think in some of the low carbon in new alternative energies that i think you ll see have done and i think you will see us continue to do those so they might require a little bit different way of evaluating them for you as you model things i think the combinations of our business is the integration of our business it will be something that i think you will have to work with us on how we model those going forward i think the returns are important but many businesses go through phases and they change their business character over time and so it s getting the right pace of doing that going forward mobility is remarkably changing your electrification of car fleets and of course there is going to be a huge amount of liquid fuels used in heavy vehicles and automobiles and air transport but mobility electric mobility is certainly coming to a city near you i think the combination of what we re doing with ultra fast charging and the liquid fuels in the convenience marketing is a key here and i think you ve heard doesn t like me to say it we actually make more money off of a cup of coffee in london than we do a tank of fuel in terms of margin so it s how we are using our assets differently in our real estate but i think is going to be part of this future as well partnerships will form some new ones some interesting ones you ve seen us talk about the creation and the goal of five unicorns and we think we have some of the technologies that can be able to do that not necessarily in low carbon but just our capabilities in terms of many things like acoustics going forward i think you may see us move into we re very intrigued with offshore wind for example we obviously think we have offshore capability to get involved with that you ll probably see that we didn t for many years quite frankly because the gearboxes were in the salt zones and now they are building in the size of the eiffel tower and the rather that salt and i think there is a lot of different things in some of the other companies are doing it as well that you ll see us pursue stay tuned jason craig marshall group head of investor relations thank you jason okay we re going to take the penultimate question from pavel molchanov from raymond james pavel pavel molchanov raymond james associates analyst thanks for taking the questions first in relation to the esg topic several of your european peers are starting to include scope 3 emissions in their internal targets you have not historically wanted to do that i m curious if you might be rethinking that stance and then secondly as it relates to reserve bookings you mentioned the small number of project fids in 2019 as the reason for sub 100 replacement should we anticipate a revival of fids this year as then means of getting a replacement back above 100 bob dudley group chief executive well i ll make a comment pavel on scope 3 emissions we do report scope 3 emissions admit that we don t but we do but scope 3 emissions is become a real short hand thing when actually you would look into it and you look at the 6 european oil companies everyone defines it differently so i think as a starting point it would help if we all got a common definition on that but we will define and get clear how we measure it and i would expect that but it s too short hand it has been at least for me it s too short hand because it just mean so many different things to different people brian would you add to that and i ll come back brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah i mean just to that point i mean probably there were 15 i can tell you this the chairman of the 100 group of 100 directors in the uk there are 15 separate definitions within scope 3 that you could look at around scope 3 emissions we ve looked at it exhaustively over the last couple of years and there is not consistency across sectors and there s not consistency within sector so i think we do need to get consistency on the merger going forward but i think it will be premature to talk about what we will now do in the next phase ahead of burn its ambition that will lay out for the company next week so i think there will be more to follow around the specifics of that on 12th of february so i think we can if you re happy to leave until then we will come back to it then bob dudley group chief executive and then on pavel reserve replacement ratios we really have the five fids in 2019 in the gulf of mexico atlantis seagull azerbaijan the central east projects thunderhead south and our kg fields in india and as we go forward we see the ones the four or five in 2020 and 7 or 8 in 21 it s never a smooth line with reserve replacement ratios they kind of move up and down it s not something we re really emphasizing value over volume so we don t really know whether it will be and i don t look at 67 or 70 as a big drop because we have been measuring about 100 over the last five years not sure but again it s value over the volume craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you pavel and we will take the final question from bertrand hodee thanks for being patient bertrand bertrand hodee kepler cheuvreux analyst thanks for taking my question and congratulation bob and brian for all the good work and strong achievement at bp i have two small question left one on project delivery so brian i appreciate you to comment on the egypt raven delays can you give us an update on tangguh train 3 and phase ii export when can we expect those to start up and the second question is related to the impact of divestment in your 2020 production so brian you mentioned 250 000 barrels per day of negative impact from divestment can you give us a share of us gas inside that number bob dudley group chief executive so yes in terms of projects tangguh expansion is on track i think first production is something like 2021 so we ll come back to that at the end of this year in terms of how that looks i don t have the other figures to hand in terms of but as far as i know everything on the project side is on track vis a vis what we laid out last year and then sorry bert on your second question bertrand hodee kepler cheuvreux analyst so the second question was around the divestment impact on your upstream production in 2020 you mentioned 250 000 barrels per day of negative impact from divestments expected in 2020 i was wondering how much of inside that relates to us lower 48 onshore natural gas bob dudley group chief executive yeah sorry so the bulk of it will be natural gas equivalent there is some assets that we sold off in the north sea in terms of oil production but the bulk of it will below 48 gas of course that would be a negative cash right now given where we see henry hub gas prices so it doesn t really have an impact from a cash perspective bertrand hodee kepler cheuvreux analyst okay thank you bob dudley group chief executive very good thank you bertrand and bertrand we will follow up with you after the call on the project specifically around those but i don t think there are any issues around it craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you everybody for the questions that s the end of the q a i m now going to hand over to bob but just before i do on a personal note bob it s been an absolute privilege to work for you and i know i speak on behalf of investor relations when i say that and i m sure that s echoed from the investment community so thank you very much bob dudley group chief executive well thank you craig and thank all of you on the call who brian and i work with so closely over the really many years here i think rather than reflecting on the things that i often do at the end of the call which is about safety people and bp s culture and the strong portfolio of relationships they are going to remain central to this company going forward bp i think has an enormously talented motivated workforce and it s what they do that makes bp a great company in my view and as for you all our investors and our analysts i think one of the cornerstones of our strategy has been this sort of steadfast focus on growing shareholder value with capital discipline and admittedly it took us a while to get on that track but set against this backdrop of all the challenges and the volatility we ve done i think it s i think it s been good i think we re delivering that investor proposition that many of you have challenges on over the years i met a great number of you all around the world and quite frankly i never failed to be impressed with your interest in the company and the industry your knowledge the challenge you have given us and the advice many times and then the support you ve given us at bp so you have my thanks it has been a for me a real privilege to work with you and a real pleasure at least most of the time some of those meetings were not that great but most of the time there were few years there so i hope you carry on with that same dialog with bernerd and the team and he takes over with craig and his terrific ir team this is a bit of a historic moment because i m sharing my very last meeting with you at bp because when i walk out of this call i m going to go out to lunch with my team and i stepped down as ceo so thank you all very much for sharing that duration 100 minutes call participants craig marshall group head of investor relations helge lund chairman bob dudley

february 03 2020 information clearing house the plight of impoverished children anywhere should evoke sympathy exemplifying as it does the suffering of the innocent and defenseless poverty among children in a wealthy country like the united states however should summon shame and outrage as well unlike poor countries sometimes run by leaders more interested in lining their pockets than anything else what excuse does the united states have for its striking levels of child poverty after all it has the world s 10th highest per capita income at 62 795 and an unrivalled gross domestic product gdp of 21 3 trillion despite that in 2020 an estimated 11 9 million american kids 16 2 of the total live below the official poverty line which is a paltry 25 701 for a family of four with two kids put another way according to the children s defense fund kids now constitute one third of the 38 1 million americans classified as poor and 70 of them have at least one working parent so poverty can t be chalked up to parental indolence yes the proportion of kids living below the poverty line has zigzagged down from 22 when the country was being ravaged by the great recession of 2008 2009 and was even higher in prior decades but no one should crack open the champagne bottles just yet the relevant standard ought to be how the united states compares to other wealthy countries the answer badly it has the 11th highest child poverty rate of the 42 industrialized countries tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd winnow that list down to european union states and canada omitting low and middle income countries and our child poverty rate ranks above only spain s use the poverty threshold of the oecd 50 of a country s median income 63 178 for the united states and the american child poverty rate leaps to 20 the united states certainly doesn t lack the means to drive child poverty down or perhaps even eliminate it many countries on that shorter oecd list have lower per capita incomes and substantially smaller gdps yet as a unicef report makes clear have done far better by their kids our high child poverty rate stems from politics not economics government policies that since the 1980s have reduced public investment as a proportion of gdp in infrastructure public education and poverty reduction these were of course the same years when a belief that big government was an obstacle to advancement took ever deeper hold especially in the republican party today washington allocates only 9 of its federal budget to children poor or not that compares to a third for americans over 65 up from 22 in 1971 if you want a single fact that sums up where we are now inflation adjusted per capita spending on kids living in the poorest families has barely budged compared to 30 years ago whereas the corresponding figure for the elderly has doubled the conservative response to all this remains predictable you can t solve complex social problems like child poverty by throwing money at them besides government antipoverty programs only foster dependence and create bloated bureaucracies without solving the problem it matters little that the actual successes of american social programs prove this claim to be flat out false before getting to that however let s take a snapshot of child poverty in america sizing up the problem defining poverty may sound straightforward but it s not the government s annual official poverty measure opm developed in the 1960s establishes poverty lines by taking into account family size multiplying the 1963 cost for a minimum food budget by three while factoring in changes in the consumer price index and comparing the result to family income in 2018 a family with a single adult and one child was considered poor with an income below 17 308 20 2012 for two adults and one child 25 465 for two adults and two children and so on according to the opm 11 8 of all americans were poor that year are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter by contrast the supplementary poverty measure spm published yearly since 2011 builds on the opm but provides a more nuanced calculus it counts the post tax income of families but also cash flows from the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc both of which help low income households it adds in government provided assistance through say the supplemental nutritional assistance program snap temporary aid to needy families tanf the children s health insurance program chip the national school lunch program nslp medicaid subsidies for housing and utilities and unemployment and disability insurance however it deducts costs like child care child support payments and out of pocket medical expenses according to the spm the 2018 national poverty rate was 12 8 of course neither of these poverty calculations can tell us how children are actually faring put simply they re faring worse in 2018 16 2 of americans under 18 lived in families with incomes below the spm line and that s not the worst of it a 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine study commissioned by congress found that 9 of poor children belong to families in deep poverty incomes that are less than 50 of the spm but 36 of all american children live in poor or near poor families those with incomes within 150 of the poverty line child poverty also varies by race a lot the rate for black children is 17 8 for hispanic kids 21 7 for their white counterparts 7 9 worse more than half of all black and hispanic kids live in near poor families compared to less than a quarter of white children combine age and race and you ll see another difference especially for children under five a population with an overall 2017 poverty rate of 19 2 break those under fives down by race however and here s what you find white kids at 15 9 hispanic kids at an eye opening 25 8 and their black peers at a staggering 32 9 location matters too the child poverty rate shifts by state and the differences are stark north dakota and utah are at 9 for instance while new mexico and mississippi are at 27 and 28 nineteen states have rates of 20 or more check out a color coded map of geographic variations in child poverty and you ll see that rates in the south southwest and parts of the midwest are above the national average while rural areas tend to have higher proportions of poor families than cities according to the department of agriculture in rural america 22 of all children and 26 of those under five were poor in 2017 why child poverty matters imagine for a moment this scenario a 200 meter footrace in which the starting blocks of some competitors are placed 75 meters behind the others barring an olympic caliber runner those who started way in front will naturally win now think of that as an analogy for the predicament that american kids born in poverty face through no fault of their own they may be smart and diligent their parents may do their best to care for them but they begin life with a huge handicap as a start the nutrition of poor children will generally be inferior to that of other kids no surprise there but here s what s not common knowledge a childhood nutritional deficit matters for years afterwards possibly for life scientific research shows that by age three the quality of childrens diets is already shaping the development of critical parts of young brains like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in ways that matter that s worth keeping in mind because four million american kids under age six were poor in 2018 as were close to half of those in families headed by single women indeed the process starts even earlier poor mothers may themselves have nutritional deficiencies that increase their risk of having babies with low birthweights that in turn can have long term effects on children s health what level of education they reach and their future incomes since the quality of nutrition affects brain size concentration and cognitive capacity it also increases the chances of having learning disabilities and experiencing mental health problems poor children are likely to be less healthy in other ways as well for reasons that range from having a greater susceptibility to asthma to higher concentrations of lead in their blood moreover poor families find it harder to get good health care and add one more thing in our zip code influenced public school system such children are likely to attend schools with far fewer resources than those in more affluent neighborhoods our national opioid problem also affects the well being of children in a striking fashion according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 2008 and 2012 a third of women in their childbearing years filled opioid based medication prescriptions in pharmacies and an estimated 14 22 of them were pregnant the result an alarming increase in the number of babies exposed to opioids in utero and experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth which is also known as neonatal abstinence syndrome or nas in medical lingo its effects a penn state study found include future increased sensitivity to pain and susceptibility to fevers and seizures between 2000 and 2014 the incidence of nas increased by a multiple of four in 2014 34 000 babies were born with nas which as a cdc report put it is equivalent to one baby suffering from opioid withdrawal born approximately every 15 minutes given the ongoing opioid crisis it s unlikely that things have improved in recent years and the complications attributable to nas don t stop with birth though the research remains at an early stage the opioid crisis only began in the early 1990s it suggests that the ill effects of nas extend well beyond infancy and include impaired cognitive and motor skills respiratory ailments learning disabilities difficulty maintaining intellectual focus and behavioral traits that make productive interaction with others harder at this point you won t be surprised to learn that nas and child poverty are connected prescription opioid use rates are much higher for women on medicaid who are more likely to be poor than those with private insurance moreover the abuse of and overdose deaths from opioids whether obtained through prescriptions or illegally have been far more widespread among the poor combine all of this and here s the picture from the months before birth on poverty diminishes opportunity capacity and agency and its consequences reach into adulthood while that rigged footrace of mine was imaginary child poverty certainly does ensure a future rigged society the good news though not in donald trump s america the race to a half decent life or better doesn t have to be rigged it needn t be this way but will be as long as trump is president can children born into poverty defy the odds realize their potential and lead fulfilling lives conservatives will point to stories of people who cleared all the obstacles created by child poverty as proof that the real solution is hard work but let s be clear poor children shouldn t have to find themselves on a tilted playing field from the first moments of their lives individual success stories aside americans raised in poor families do markedly less well compared to those from middle class or affluent homes and it doesn t matter whether you choose college attendance employment rates or future household income as your measure and the longer they live in poverty the worse the odds that they ll escape it in adulthood for one thing they re far less likely to finish high school or attend college than their more fortunate peers conversely as harvard economist raj chetty and his colleagues have shown kids life prospects improve when parents with low incomes are given the financial wherewithal to move to neighborhoods with higher social mobility rates thanks to better schools and services including health care as in that imaginary footrace the starting point matters but here the news is grim the social progress index places the united states 75th out of 149 countries in access to quality education and 70th in access to quality health care and poor kids are of course at a particular disadvantage yet childhood circumstances can be and have been changed and the sorts of government programs that conservatives love to savage have helped enormously in that process child poverty plunged from 28 in 1967 to 15 6 in 2016 in significant part due to programs like medicaid and the food stamp act started in the 1960s as part of president lyndon johnson s war on poverty such programs helped poor families pay for housing food child care and medical expenses as did later tax legislation like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our own history and that of other wealthy countries show that child poverty is anything but an unalterable reality the record also shows that changing it requires mobilizing funds of the sort now being wasted on ventures like america s multitrillion dollar forever wars certainly an increase in jobs and earnings can reduce child poverty wall street journal odes to donald trump s tax cuts and deregulation policies highlight the present 3 5 unemployment rate the lowest in 60 years a surge in new jobs and wage growth at all levels notably for workers with low incomes who lack college degrees this storyline however omits important realities programs that reduce child poverty help even in years when poor or near poor parents gain and of course are critical in bad times since sooner or later booming job markets also bust furthermore the magic that trump fans tout occurred at a moment when many state and city governments were mandating increases in the minimum wage employers who hired especially in heavily populated states like california new york illinois ohio and michigan had to pay more as for cutting child poverty it hasn t exactly been a presidential priority in the trump years not like the drive to pass a 1 5 trillion corporate and individual income tax cut whose gains flowed mainly to the richest americans while inflating the budget deficit to 1 trillion in 2019 according to the treasury department then there s that impenetrable powerful beautiful wall its estimated price ranges from 21 billion to 70 billion excluding maintenance and don t forget the proposed extra 33 billion in military spending for this fiscal year alone part of president trump s plan to boost such spending by 683 billion over the next decade as for poor kids and their parents the president and congressional republicans are beginning to slash an array of programs ranging from the supplemental nutritional assistance program to medicaid 1 2 trillion worth over the next 10 years that have long helped struggling families and children in particular get by the trump administration has for good measure rewritten the eligibility rules for such programs in order to lower the number of people who qualify the supposed goal to cut costs by reducing dependence on government never mind the subsidies and tax loopholes trump s crew has created for corporations and the super wealthy which add up to many billions of dollars in spending and lost revenue these supposedly work ethic driven austerity policies batter working families with young kids that for example desperately need childcare which can take a big bite out of paychecks 10 or more for all households with kids but half in the case of poor families add to that the cost of unsubsidized housing median monthly rent increased by nearly a third between 2001 and 2015 put another way rents consume more than half the income of the bottom 20 of americans according to the federal reserve the advent of trump has also made the struggle of low income families with healthcare bills even harder the number of kids without health insurance jumped by 425 000 between 2017 and 2018 when according to the census bureau 4 3 million children lacked coverage even before donald trump s election only one sixth of eligible families with kids received assistance for childcare and a paltry one fifth got housing subsidies yet his administration arrived prepared to put programs that helped some of them pay for housing and childcare on the chopping block no point in such families looking to him for a hand in the future he won t be building any trump towers for them whatever make america great again may mean it certainly doesn t involve helping america s poor kids as long as donald trump oversees their race into life they ll find themselves ever farther from the starting line rajan menon a tomdispatch regular is the anne and bernard

lahore indian government s 428 billion budget for fiscal year 2020 21 has been announced at a time when the country s economy is stuck in its biggest economic slump in more than a decade though the economic wizards in new delhi are optimistic that the country s economic growth will rebound and hit a rather promising 6 per cent to 6 5 per cent mark during the forthcoming financial year starting april 1 it is imperative to note that just last year india was the world s fastest growing major economy currently the fifth largest economy in world india s debt had come down to 48 7 per cent in march 2019 from 52 2 per cent in march 2014 but snags have obstructed the smooth sailing since although indian businessmen were expecting of their government to inject more fiscal stimulus into an economy that had grown at about 4 8 percent in 2019 a sharp drop from 6 8 percent in 2018 many of them were largely dismayed with the budgetary provisions the new york times has remarked the government unveiled a modest budget that one economist called smoke and mirrors but it offered no large stimulus program to provide more jobs or money in the pockets of india s 1 3 billion residents most of who barely get by through farming or work in the informal economy nor did the budget propose any additional support for the country s weakened financial institutions this was indian union finance minister nirmala sitharaman s second budget which thus means that she became the second women ever to present an indian budget twice after the late indira gandhi this also incidentally was the second budget after the premier narendra modi led national democratic alliance had returned to power for a second successive term more highlights from indian budget 2020 21 according to the economic times of india the india today the new york times and live mint an indian financial daily newspaper published by hindustan times media etc the recent indian budget speech was the longest ever delivered by any indian finance minister since february 18 1860 when the first ever budget was presented however the first budget of independent india was tabled by the then finance minister shanmukham chetty on november 26 1947 the indian government has allocated inr 370 billion or pkr 7274 billion over us 47 108 billion as the defence budget for 2020 21 which was a hike of only 5 8 percent over the allocation for this sector for the ongoing financial year in 2001 according to research conducted by the jang group and geo television network the indian defence budget had stood at us 11 8 billion and what could be dubbed a sharp contrast pakistan s defence budget currently stands at us 7 6 billion only indian budget papers have shown that the defence pension bill has surged by 13 per cent defence pensions have been allocated indian rs130 billion us 1 8 billion for modernization and buying new weapon systems defence forces have been allocated rs1 107 34 billion pkr2 393 billion which is rs 103 40 billion more than what was provided in last year s budget according to a leading indian media house this year s indian defence budget saw an increase of rs 25 billion in the army s capital budget when compared to revised estimates of last year s defence budget undergoing the process of upgrading their ageing arsenals with new fighter jets warships and submarines indian armed forces have thus witnessed a modest rise in their financial resources the indian defence budget minus pensions is currently around 1 8 per cent of the country s gdp defence analysts say it is one of the lowest since the 1962 india china border war that new delhi s forces had lost miserably india has approximately 2 6 million defence pensioners and each year it adds 5 5 million pensioners to this total the government clubs the defence budget with pensions to say it is over 2 per cent of the gdp the army accounts for a lion s share of the budget over 56 per cent the indian air force in sharp contrast saw capital budget slashed by rs 12 billion the modi government has retained its focus on affordable housing but did not announce specific measures to revive demand market analysts have hoped that the budgetary announcements may not revitalise the sluggish indian real estate market the indian educational sector s allocation stands at indian rupees 993 billion or us 14 billion the healthcare budget stands at rs690 billion a health assurance cover of up to rs5 lakh per family would be given and is targeted to cover over 100 million poor and vulnerable families the agriculture sector outlay rests at rs1 38 lakh crore the rural development allocation is rs 1 23 lakh crore and the agriculture credit target stands at rs15 lakh crore by the way the country plans to double its milk processing capacity by 2025 food subsidy would see a spending of rs1 15 trillion pkr2 486 billion in 2020 21 an amount of rs 409 15 billion 5 76 billion would be dished out as petroleum subsidy and there would be a fertilizer subsidy to the tune of rs713 09 billion 10 03 billion in 2020 21 the indian government has slashed the personal income tax rate for individuals for fiscal year 2020 21 under the new regime taxpayers will pay 10 per cent 15 per cent 20 per cent and 25 per cent for incomes between rs 5 7 5 lakh rs 7 5 10 lakh rs 10 12 5 lakh and rs 12 5 15 lakh respectively however to avail this scheme which is optional the taxpayers would have to let go of certain exemptions according to indian finance minister five new smart cities would be developed and 100 more airports would be constructed by 2024 india plans to monetize over 6 000 km of highways in 12 lots by 2024 and is aiming to privatize at least one major port new delhi plans to raise rs 900 billion funds by selling a partial stake in life insurance corporation through an initial public offering ipo it plans to sell a stake in industrial development bank of india to private sector and also aims to establish an indian institute of heritage and conservation at five sites to develop them into world class archaeological sites an amount of rs 100 lakh crore would be invested on infrastructure over the next 5 years and as far as the national infrastructure pipeline is concerned more than 6 500 projects across sectors would be classified as per their size and stage of development indian rs 7 billion us 19 billion has been earmarked for the welfare and uplift of scheduled tribes and castes inclusive of backward classes the development of indian occupied kashmir iok has been allocated indian rs30 757 crore pkr665 billion and the territory of ladakh has been given indian rs 5 958 crore us 840 million an amount of rs one billion us 14 million has been allocated for holding the g 20 summit welfare fund of senior citizens has got rs 95 billion us 1 3 billion power and renewable energy sectors have been allocated rs 220 billion indian finance minister announced in her 45 page long speech that the national gas grid to be increased by over 10 000 km india plans to come out with a scheme focused on encouraging manufacture of mobile phones electronic equipment and semiconductor packaging besides wishing to encourage private sector to build data centre parks throughout the country this step can potentially benefit all major it firms including tcs infosys wipro hcl technologies tech mahindra mindtree persistent hexaware and adani enterprises india will provide rs 273 billion 3 84 billion for promotion of industry and commerce and rs 44 billion 619 11 million for clean air incentives in cities with over one million people firms operating old thermal power plants have been advised to shut units if emission norms are not met moreover the national indian skill development agency would give special thrust to infrastructure focused skill development opportunities assist in project preparation and actively involve young engineers management graduates and economists from universities the infrastructure agencies of the government would involve youth power in start ups an amount of rs 1 7 lakh crore has been proposed for transport infrastructure in 2020 21 while a dividend

columbus ind business wire cummins inc nyse cmi today reported results for the fourth quarter of 2019 fourth quarter revenues of 5 6 billion decreased 9 percent from the same quarter in 2018 lower truck production in north america and weaker demand in global construction mining and power generation markets drove the majority of the revenue decrease currency negatively impacted revenues by 1 percent primarily due to a stronger us dollar fourth quarter sales in north america declined by 8 percent while international revenues decreased by 10 percent led by declines in europe asia pacific latin america and india earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda in the fourth quarter were 563 million 10 1 percent of sales or 682 million 12 2 percent of sales excluding restructuring compared to 896 million 14 6 percent of sales a year ago after a strong start to 2019 demand declined across most geographies and end markets in the second half of the year said tony satterthwaite president and chief operating officer we moved quickly to align costs with the weaker global outlook executing a number of actions which we expect to yield annual savings of 250 to 300 million the company executed several measures to reduce costs and improve future performance in the second half of 2019 these actions included a plan to reduce headcount which resulted in a charge of

deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2019 as well as expected reductions in orders in most u s and international markets in 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2019 we began executing restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs to the extent these programs involve voluntary separations a liability is generally recorded at the time offers to employees are accepted to the extent these programs provide separation benefits in accordance with pre existing agreements or policies a liability is recorded once the amount is probable and reasonably estimable we incurred a charge of 119 million 90 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2019 for these actions which impacted approximately 2 300 employees the voluntary actions were completed by december 31 2019 and the majority of the involuntary actions were executed prior to january 31 2020 with expected completion by march 31 2020 due to the inherent uncertainty involved actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates income taxes our effective tax rates for the three and twelve

children in a wealthy country like the united states however should summon shame and outrage as well unlike poor countries sometimes run by leaders more interested in lining their pockets than anything else what excuse does the united states have for its striking levels of child poverty after all it has the world s 10th highest per capita income at 62 795 and an unrivalled gross domestic product gdp of 21 3 trillion despite that in 2020 an estimated 11 9 million american kids 16 2 percent of the total live below the official poverty line which is a paltry 25 701 for a family of four with two kids put another way according to the children s defense fund kids now constitute one third of the 38 1 million americans classified as poor and 70 percent of them have at least one working parent so poverty can t be chalked up to parental indolence yes the proportion of kids living below the poverty line has zigzagged down from 22 percent when the country was being ravaged by the great recession of 2008 09 and was even higher in prior decades still no one should crack open the champagne bottles just yet the relevant standard ought to be how the united states compares to other wealthy countries the answer badly it has the 11th highest child poverty rate of the 42 industrialized countries tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd winnow that list down to european union states and canada omitting low and middle income countries and our child poverty rate ranks above only spain s using the poverty threshold of the oecd 50 percent of a country s median income 63 178 for the united states and the american child poverty rate leaps to 20 percent the united states certainly doesn t lack the means to drive child poverty down or perhaps even eliminate it many countries on that shorter oecd list have lower per capita incomes and substantially smaller gdps but as a unicef report makes clear have done far better by their kids our high child poverty rate stems from politics not economics government policies that since the 1980s have reduced public investment as a proportion of gdp in infrastructure public education and poverty reduction these were of course the same years when a belief that big government was an obstacle to advancement took ever deeper hold especially in the republican party today washington allocates only 9 percent of its federal budget to children poor or not that compares to a third for americans over 65 up from 22 percent in 1971 if you want a single fact that sums up where we are now inflation adjusted per capita spending on kids living in the poorest families has barely budged compared to 30 years ago whereas the corresponding figure for the elderly has doubled popular swipe left below to

new era of backlash in sports and politics dave zirin the conservative response to all this remains predictable you can t solve complex social problems like child poverty by throwing money at them besides government antipoverty programs only foster dependence and create bloated bureaucracies without solving the problem it matters little that the success of american social programs proves this claim to be flat out false before getting to that however let s take a snapshot of child poverty in america sizing up the problem defining poverty may sound straightforward but it s not the government s annual official poverty measure opm developed in the 1960s establishes poverty lines by taking into account family size multiplying the 1963 cost for a minimum food budget by three while factoring in changes in the consumer price index and comparing the result to family income in 2018 a family with a single adult and one child was considered poor with an income below 17 308 20 2012 for two adults and one child 25 465 for two adults and two children and so on according to the opm 11 8 percent of all americans were poor that year by contrast the supplementary poverty measure spm published yearly since 2011 builds on the opm but provides a more nuanced calculus it counts the post tax income of families but also cash flows from the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc both of which help low income households it adds in government provided assistance through say the supplemental nutritional assistance program snap temporary aid to needy families tanf the children s health insurance program chip the national school lunch program nslp medicaid subsidies for housing and utilities and unemployment and disability insurance however it deducts costs like child care child support payments and out of pocket medical expenses according to the spm the 2018 national poverty rate was 12 8 percent of course neither of these poverty calculations can tell us how children are actually faring put simply they re faring worse in 2018 16 2 percent of americans under 18 lived in families with incomes below the spm line and that s not the worst of it a 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine study commissioned by congress found that 9 percent of poor children belong to families in deep poverty incomes that are less than 50 percent of the spm but 36 percent of all american children live in poor or near poor families those with incomes within 150 percent of the poverty line current issue view our current issue child poverty also varies by race a lot the rate for black children is 17 8 percent for hispanic kids 21 7 percent for their white counterparts 7 9 percent worse more than half of all black and hispanic kids live in near poor families compared to less than a quarter of white children combine age and race and you ll see another difference especially for children under 5 a population with an overall 2017 poverty rate of 19 2 percent break those under 5s down by race however and here s what you find white kids at 15 9 percent hispanic kids at an eye opening 25 8 percent and their black peers at a staggering 32 9 percent location matters too the child poverty rate shifts by state and the differences are stark north dakota and utah are at 9 percent for instance while new mexico and mississippi are at 27 percent and 28 percent nineteen states have rates of 20 percent or more check out a color coded map of geographic variations in child poverty and you ll see that rates in the south southwest and parts of the midwest are above the national average while rural areas tend to have higher proportions of poor families than cities according to the department of agriculture in rural america 22 percent of all children and 26 percent of those under 5 were poor in 2017 why child poverty matters imagine for a moment this scenario a 200 meter footrace in which the starting blocks of some competitors are placed 75 meters behind the others barring an olympic caliber runner those who started way in front will naturally win now think of that as an analogy for the predicament that american kids born in poverty face through no fault of their own they may be smart and diligent their parents may do their best to care for them but they begin life with a huge handicap as a start the nutrition of poor children will generally be inferior to that of other kids no surprise there but here s what s not common knowledge a childhood nutritional deficit matters for years afterwards possibly for life scientific research shows that by age three the quality of childrens diets is already shaping the development of critical parts of young brains like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in ways that matter that s worth keeping in mind because four million american kids under age six were poor in 2018 as were close to half of those in families headed by single women indeed the process starts even earlier poor mothers may themselves have nutritional deficiencies that increase their risk of having babies with low birth weights that in turn can have long term effects on children s health what level of education they reach and their future incomes since the quality of nutrition affects brain size concentration and cognitive capacity it also increases the chances of having learning disabilities and experiencing mental health problems poor children are likely to be less healthy in other ways as well for reasons that range from having a greater susceptibility to asthma to higher concentrations of lead in their blood moreover poor families find it harder to get good health care and add one more thing in our zip code influenced public school system such children are likely to attend schools with far fewer resources than those in more affluent neighborhoods our national opioid problem also affects the well being of children in a striking fashion according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 2008 and 2012 a third of women in their childbearing years filled opioid based medication prescriptions in pharmacies and an estimated 14 percent 22 percent of them were pregnant the result an alarming increase in the number of babies exposed to opioids in utero and experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth which is also known as neonatal abstinence syndrome or nas in medical lingo its effects a penn state study found include future increased sensitivity to pain and susceptibility to fevers and seizures between 2000 and 2014 the incidence of nas increased by a multiple of four in 2014 34 000 babies were born with nas which as a cdc report put it is equivalent to one baby suffering from opioid withdrawal born approximately every 15 minutes given the ongoing opioid crisis it s unlikely that things have improved in recent years and the complications attributable to nas don t stop with birth though the research remains at an early stage the opioid crisis only began in the early 1990s it suggests that the ill effects of nas extend well beyond infancy and include impaired cognitive and motor skills respiratory ailments learning disabilities difficulty maintaining intellectual focus and behavioral traits that make productive interaction with others harder at this point you won t be surprised to learn that nas and child poverty are connected prescription opioid use rates are much higher for women on medicaid who are more likely to be poor than those with private insurance moreover the abuse of and overdose deaths from opioids whether obtained through prescriptions or illegally have been far more widespread among the poor combine all of this and here s the picture from the months before birth on poverty diminishes opportunity capacity and agency and its consequences reach into adulthood while that rigged footrace of mine was imaginary child poverty certainly does ensure a future rigged society the good news though not in donald trump s america the race to a half decent life or better doesn t have to be rigged it needn t be this way but will be as long as trump is president can children born into poverty defy the odds realize their potential and lead fulfilling lives conservatives will point to stories of people who cleared all the obstacles created by child poverty as proof that the real solution is hard work but let s be clear poor children shouldn t have to find themselves on a tilted playing field from the first moments of their lives individual success stories aside americans raised in poor families do markedly less well compared to those from middle class or affluent homes and it doesn t matter whether you choose college attendance employment rates or future household income as your measure and the longer they live in poverty the worse the odds that they ll escape it in adulthood for one thing they re far less likely to finish high school or attend college than their more fortunate peers conversely as harvard economist raj chetty and his colleagues have shown kids life prospects improve when parents with low incomes are given the financial wherewithal to move to neighborhoods with higher social mobility rates thanks to better schools and services including health care as in that imaginary footrace the starting point matters but here the news is grim the social progress index places the united states 75th out of 149 countries in access to quality education and 70th in access to quality health care and poor kids are of course at a particular disadvantage yet childhood circumstances can be and have been changed and the sorts of government programs that conservatives love to savage have helped enormously in that process child poverty plunged from 28 percent in 1967 to 15 6 percent in 2016 in significant part due to programs like medicaid and the food stamp act started in the 1960s as part of president lyndon johnson s war on poverty such programs helped poor families pay for housing food child care and medical expenses as did later tax legislation like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our own history and that of other wealthy countries show that child poverty is anything but an unalterable reality the record also shows that changing it requires mobilizing funds of the sort now being wasted on ventures like america s multitrillion dollar forever wars certainly an increase in jobs and earnings can reduce child poverty wall street journal odes to donald trump s tax cuts and deregulation policies highlight the present 3 5 percent unemployment rate the lowest in 60 years a surge in new jobs and wage growth at all levels notably for workers with low incomes who lack college degrees this storyline however omits important realities programs that reduce child poverty help even in years when poor or near poor parents gain and of course are critical in bad times since sooner or later booming job markets also bust furthermore the magic that trump fans tout occurred at a moment when many state and city governments were mandating increases in the minimum wage employers who hired especially in heavily populated states like california new york illinois ohio and michigan had to pay more as for cutting child poverty it hasn t exactly been a presidential priority in the trump years not like the drive to pass a 1 5 trillion corporate and individual income tax cut whose gains flowed mainly to the richest americans while inflating the budget deficit to 1 trillion in 2019 according to the treasury department then there s that impenetrable powerful beautiful wall its estimated price ranges from 21 billion to 70 billion excluding maintenance and don t forget the proposed extra 33 billion in military spending for this fiscal year alone part of president trump s plan to boost such spending by 683 billion over the next decade as for poor kids and their parents the president and congressional republicans are beginning to slash an array of programs ranging from the supplemental nutritional assistance program to medicaid 1 2 trillion worth over the next 10 years that have long helped struggling families and children in particular get by the trump administration has for good measure rewritten the eligibility rules for such programs in order to lower the number of people who qualify the supposed goal to cut costs by reducing dependence on government never mind the subsidies and tax loopholes trump s crew has created for corporations and the super wealthy which add up to many billions of dollars in spending and lost revenue these supposedly work ethic driven austerity policies batter working families with young kids that for example desperately need childcare which can take a big bite out of paychecks 10 percent or more for all households with kids but half in the case of poor families add to that the cost of unsubsidized housing median monthly rent increased by nearly a third between 2001 and 2015 put another way rents consume more than half the income of the bottom 20 percent of americans according to the federal reserve the advent of trump has also made the struggle of low income families with healthcare bills even harder the number of kids without health insurance jumped by 425 000 between 2017 and 2018 when according to the census bureau 4 3 million children lacked coverage even before donald trump s election only one sixth of eligible families with kids received assistance for childcare and a paltry one fifth got housing subsidies yet his administration arrived prepared to put programs that helped some of them pay for housing and childcare on the chopping block no point in such families looking to him for a hand in the future he won t be building any trump towers for them whatever make america great again may mean it certainly doesn t involve helping america s poor kids as long as donald trump oversees their race into life they ll find themselves ever farther from the starting line

the plight of impoverished children anywhere should evoke sympathy exemplifying as it does the suffering of the innocent and defenseless poverty among children in a wealthy country like the united states however should summon shame and outrage as well unlike poor countries sometimes run by leaders more interested in lining their pockets than anything else what excuse does the united states have for its striking levels of child poverty after all it has the world s 10th highest per capita income at 62 795 and an unrivalled gross domestic product gdp of 21 3 trillion despite that in 2020 an estimated 11 9 million american kids 16 2 of the total live below the official poverty line which is a paltry 25 701 for a family of four with two kids put another way according to the children s defense fund kids now constitute one third of the 38 1 million americans classified as poor and 70 of them have at least one working parent so poverty can t be chalked up to parental indolence yes the proportion of kids living below the poverty line has zigzagged down from 22 when the country was being ravaged by the great recession of 2008 2009 and was even higher in prior decades but no one should crack open the champagne bottles just yet the relevant standard ought to be how the united states compares to other wealthy countries the answer badly it has the 11th highest child poverty rate of the 42 industrialized countries tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd winnow that list down to european union states and canada omitting low and middle income countries and our child poverty rate ranks above only spain s use the poverty threshold of the oecd 50 of a country s median income 63 178 for the united states and the american child poverty rate leaps to 20 the united states certainly doesn t lack the means to drive child poverty down or perhaps even eliminate it many countries on that shorter oecd list have lower per capita incomes and substantially smaller gdps yet as a unicef report makes clear have done far better by their kids our high child poverty rate stems from politics not economics government policies that since the 1980s have reduced public investment as a proportion of gdp in infrastructure public education and poverty reduction these were of course the same years when a belief that big government was an obstacle to advancement took ever deeper hold especially in the republican party today washington allocates only 9 of its federal budget to children poor or not that compares to a third for americans over 65 up from 22 in 1971 if you want a single fact that sums up where we are now inflation adjusted per capita spending on kids living in the poorest families has barely budged compared to 30 years ago whereas the corresponding figure for the elderly has doubled the conservative response to all this remains predictable you can t solve complex social problems like child poverty by throwing money at them besides government antipoverty programs only foster dependence and create bloated bureaucracies without solving the problem it matters little that the actual successes of american social programs prove this claim to be flat out false before getting to that however let s take a snapshot of child poverty in america sizing up the problem defining poverty may sound straightforward but it s not the government s annual official poverty measure opm developed in the 1960s establishes poverty lines by taking into account family size multiplying the 1963 cost for a minimum food budget by three while factoring in changes in the consumer price index and comparing the result to family income in 2018 a family with a single adult and one child was considered poor with an income below 17 308 20 2012 for two adults and one child 25 465 for two adults and two children and so on according to the opm 11 8 of all americans were poor that year by contrast the supplementary poverty measure spm published yearly since 2011 builds on the opm but provides a more nuanced calculus it counts the post tax income of families but also cash flows from the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc both of which help low income households it adds in government provided assistance through say the supplemental nutritional assistance program snap temporary aid to needy families tanf the children s health insurance program chip the national school lunch program nslp medicaid subsidies for housing and utilities and unemployment and disability insurance however it deducts costs like child care child support payments and out of pocket medical expenses according to the spm the 2018 national poverty rate was 12 8 of course neither of these poverty calculations can tell us how children are actually faring put simply they re faring worse in 2018 16 2 of americans under 18 lived in families with incomes below the spm line and that s not the worst of it a 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine study commissioned by congress found that 9 of poor children belong to families in deep poverty incomes that are less than 50 of the spm but 36 of all american children live in poor or near poor families those with incomes within 150 of the poverty line child poverty also varies by race a lot the rate for black children is 17 8 for hispanic kids 21 7 for their white counterparts 7 9 worse more than half of all black and hispanic kids live in near poor families compared to less than a quarter of white children combine age and race and you ll see another difference especially for children under five a population with an overall 2017 poverty rate of 19 2 break those under fives down by race however and here s what you find white kids at 15 9 hispanic kids at an eye opening 25 8 and their black peers at a staggering 32 9 location matters too the child poverty rate shifts by state and the differences are stark north dakota and utah are at 9 for instance while new mexico and mississippi are at 27 and 28 nineteen states have rates of 20 or more check out a color coded map of geographic variations in child poverty and you ll see that rates in the south southwest and parts of the midwest are above the national average while rural areas tend to have higher proportions of poor families than cities according to the department of agriculture in rural america 22 of all children and 26 of those under five were poor in 2017 why child poverty matters imagine for a moment this scenario a 200 meter footrace in which the starting blocks of some competitors are placed 75 meters behind the others barring an olympic caliber runner those who started way in front will naturally win now think of that as an analogy for the predicament that american kids born in poverty face through no fault of their own they may be smart and diligent their parents may do their best to care for them but they begin life with a huge handicap as a start the nutrition of poor children will generally be inferior to that of other kids no surprise there but here s what s not common knowledge a childhood nutritional deficit matters for years afterwards possibly for life scientific research shows that by age three the quality of childrens diets is already shaping the development of critical parts of young brains like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in ways that matter that s worth keeping in mind because four million american kids under age six were poor in 2018 as were close to half of those in families headed by single women indeed the process starts even earlier poor mothers may themselves have nutritional deficiencies that increase their risk of having babies with low birthweights that in turn can have long term effects on children s health what level of education they reach and their future incomes since the quality of nutrition affects brain size concentration and cognitive capacity it also increases the chances of having learning disabilities and experiencing mental health problems poor children are likely to be less healthy in other ways as well for reasons that range from having a greater susceptibility to asthma to higher concentrations of lead in their blood moreover poor families find it harder to get good health care and add one more thing in our zip code influenced public school system such children are likely to attend schools with far fewer resources than those in more affluent neighborhoods our national opioid problem also affects the well being of children in a striking fashion according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 2008 and 2012 a third of women in their childbearing years filled opioid based medication prescriptions in pharmacies and an estimated 14 22 of them were pregnant the result an alarming increase in the number of babies exposed to opioids in utero and experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth which is also known as neonatal abstinence syndrome or nas in medical lingo its effects a penn state study found include future increased sensitivity to pain and susceptibility to fevers and seizures between 2000 and 2014 the incidence of nas increased by a multiple of four in 2014 34 000 babies were born with nas which as a cdc report put it is equivalent to one baby suffering from opioid withdrawal born approximately every 15 minutes given the ongoing opioid crisis it s unlikely that things have improved in recent years and the complications attributable to nas don t stop with birth though the research remains at an early stage the opioid crisis only began in the early 1990s it suggests that the ill effects of nas extend well beyond infancy and include impaired cognitive and motor skills respiratory ailments learning disabilities difficulty maintaining intellectual focus and behavioral traits that make productive interaction with others harder at this point you won t be surprised to learn that nas and child poverty are connected prescription opioid use rates are much higher for women on medicaid who are more likely to be poor than those with private insurance moreover the abuse of and overdose deaths from opioids whether obtained through prescriptions or illegally have been far more widespread among the poor combine all of this and here s the picture from the months before birth on poverty diminishes opportunity capacity and agency and its consequences reach into adulthood while that rigged footrace of mine was imaginary child poverty certainly does ensure a future rigged society the good news though not in donald trump s america the race to a half decent life or better doesn t have to be rigged it needn t be this way but will be as long as trump is president can children born into poverty defy the odds realize their potential and lead fulfilling lives conservatives will point to stories of people who cleared all the obstacles created by child poverty as proof that the real solution is hard work but let s be clear poor children shouldn t have to find themselves on a tilted playing field from the first moments of their lives individual success stories aside americans raised in poor families do markedly less well compared to those from middle class or affluent homes and it doesn t matter whether you choose college attendance employment rates or future household income as your measure and the longer they live in poverty the worse the odds that they ll escape it in adulthood for one thing they re far less likely to finish high school or attend college than their more fortunate peers conversely as harvard economist raj chetty and his colleagues have shown kids life prospects improve when parents with low incomes are given the financial wherewithal to move to neighborhoods with higher social mobility rates thanks to better schools and services including health care as in that imaginary footrace the starting point matters but here the news is grim the social progress index places the united states 75th out of 149 countries in access to quality education and 70th in access to quality health care and poor kids are of course at a particular disadvantage yet childhood circumstances can be and have been changed and the sorts of government programs that conservatives love to savage have helped enormously in that process child poverty plunged from 28 in 1967 to 15 6 in 2016 in significant part due to programs like medicaid and the food stamp act started in the 1960s as part of president lyndon johnson s war on poverty such programs helped poor families pay for housing food child care and medical expenses as did later tax legislation like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our own history and that of other wealthy countries show that child poverty is anything but an unalterable reality the record also shows that changing it requires mobilizing funds of the sort now being wasted on ventures like america s multitrillion dollar forever wars certainly an increase in jobs and earnings can reduce child poverty wall street journal odes to donald trump s tax cuts and deregulation policies highlight the present 3 5 unemployment rate the lowest in 60 years a surge in new jobs and wage growth at all levels notably for workers with low incomes who lack college degrees this storyline however omits important realities programs that reduce child poverty help even in years when poor or near poor parents gain and of course are critical in bad times since sooner or later booming job markets also bust furthermore the magic that trump fans tout occurred at a moment when many state and city governments were mandating increases in the minimum wage employers who hired especially in heavily populated states like california new york illinois ohio and michigan had to pay more as for cutting child poverty it hasn t exactly been a presidential priority in the trump years not like the drive to pass a 1 5 trillion corporate and individual income tax cut whose gains flowed mainly to the richest americans while inflating the budget deficit to 1 trillion in 2019 according to the treasury department then there s that impenetrable powerful beautiful wall its estimated price ranges from 21 billion to 70 billion excluding maintenance and don t forget the proposed extra 33 billion in military spending for this fiscal year alone part of president trump s plan to boost such spending by 683 billion over the next decade as for poor kids and their parents the president and congressional republicans are beginning to slash an array of programs ranging from the supplemental nutritional assistance program to medicaid 1 2 trillion worth over the next 10 years that have long helped struggling families and children in particular get by the trump administration has for good measure rewritten the eligibility rules for such programs in order to lower the number of people who qualify the supposed goal to cut costs by reducing dependence on government never mind the subsidies and tax loopholes trump s crew has created for corporations and the super wealthy which add up to many billions of dollars in spending and lost revenue these supposedly work ethic driven austerity policies batter working families with young kids that for example desperately need childcare which can take a big bite out of paychecks 10 or more for all households with kids but half in the case of poor families add to that the cost of unsubsidized housing median monthly rent increased by nearly a third between 2001 and 2015 put another way rents consume more than half the income of the bottom 20 of americans according to the federal reserve the advent of trump has also made the struggle of low income families with healthcare bills even harder the number of kids without health insurance jumped by 425 000 between 2017 and 2018 when according to the census bureau 4 3 million children lacked coverage even before donald trump s election only one sixth of eligible families with kids received assistance for childcare and a paltry one fifth got housing subsidies yet his administration arrived prepared to put programs that helped some of them pay for housing and childcare on the chopping block no point in such families looking to him for a hand in the future he won t be building any trump towers for them whatever make america great again may mean it certainly doesn t involve helping america s poor kids as long as donald trump oversees their race into life they ll find themselves ever farther from the starting line

financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and its domestic businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent the company s segment tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pre tax income loss of each segment which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between u s gaap and local tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance products the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of the company s revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force insurance in force for the company s mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date risk in force for the company s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance risk in force in the australia mortgage insurance business is computed using an effective risk in force amount which recognizes that the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor of 35 percent that represents the highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of the company s mortgage insurance business in australia the company also has certain risk share arrangements in australia where it provides pro rata coverage of certain loans rather than 100 percent coverage as a result for loans with these risk share arrangements the applicable pro rata coverage amount provided is used when applying the factor the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the

bp earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 bp p l c bp 0 19 q4 2019 earnings call 4 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator welcome to the bp presentation to the financial community webcast and conference call i now hand over to craig marshall head of investor relations craig marshall group head of investor relations good morning everyone and welcome to bp s fourth quarter and full year results presentation for 2019 i m joined here today by helge lund chairman bob dudley group chief executive brian gilvary chief financial officer and bernard looney upstream chief executive and ceo designate before we begin i need to draw your attention to our cautionary statement during today s presentation we will make forward looking statements that refer to our estimates plans and expectations actual results and outcomes could differ materially due to factors we note on this slide and in our uk and sec filings please refer to our annual report stock exchange announcement and sec filings for more details these documents are available on our website now over to helge helge lund chairman good morning everyone i m helge lund bp chairman it s not usual for the chair to join these calls but i m going to make an exception today because it s bob dudley s last investor call for bp and his final day as chief executive after a 40 year career a nearly 10 at the top that s quite something bob is going to speak shortly but he is not a man given to self congratulation so i wanted to offer some reflections on his period as chief executive but first i should also acknowledge another announcement made last month brian gilvary has decided to step down too after 34 years with bp and eight as a cfo i hope brian won t mind me saying that he has been one of the truly great cfos but brian is going to be around until june we ll get some more value out of him yet and pay tribute properly when the time comes so back to bob bp today is very different to the bp of october 2010 when he took on the job the fact that bp is so strong today is in many ways because of bob s handling of that early period and his leadership sense his first task was not one to envy recovery from the deepwater horizon tragedy but bob quickly stabilized bp then he changed bp s culture instilled new values and helped make bp safer and profitable again i count that as the first great achievement of his leadership then there was the oil price downturn a big challenge for the whole industry bob made bp leaner and more modern and his phrase value over volume became a guide for the business and bp came out even stronger that was his second great achievement the third is bob s leadership into the energy transition he has invested in low carbon and positioned bp to dynamically drive the energy transition forward and of course that story is evolving and we re really excited for what bernard is going to do next so thank you bob for your leadership and for the position in which you leave bp you have our gratitude bob dudley group chief executive helge thank you for your kind words and good morning everyone as this is my last presentation to you as ceo i d like to break from the mold a little and spend a few minutes talking about bp s journey over the last period before handing over to brian to run through the results bernard is here today too and he will say a few words to close the presentation before brian and i take your questions looking back to the beginning of this decade bp was facing one of the biggest challenges in its history deepwater horizon was a tragic accident which shook bp to its core it was clear then that we needed to not only deal with the incident but also focus clearly on the future of the organization to do this we identified three key priorities for the group safety and operational risk management rebuilding trust and delivering value growth for our shareholders we have made many advances since then with these priorities defining the company we have become one that is well positioned to succeed as the world s energy system transition now a little more detail on each priority first safety and operational risk safety is a core value and we have done an enormous amount to make bp a safer place to work we have reinforced our safety and operational risk function putting in place systems and processes to improve our operations and performance this includes bringing together a set of global requirements under one operating management system along with our values of safety respect excellence courage and one team it defines how we work in a systematic way across bp we have also reshaped our businesses and embedded a functional model changing what it feels like to work for bp and externally we have changed and enhanced how we work with our partners and all of this has made a difference we have seen an almost 70 decline in tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events since 2011 and this year achieved our lowest ever recordable injury frequency both important successes we have however seen an increase in process safety events in 2019 mainly following some asset acquisitions this serves as an important reminder that we must remain steadfast in our focus on safety our aim remains the same to have no accidents no harm to people and no damage to the environment next rebuilding trust in bp at the time i said that the building of trust comes from doing what you say you re going to do and i believe we did that in meeting our obligations in the gulf not only were we quick to establish a clear process to meet our legal and financial commitments with the us gulf states and the federal government but we also applied rigorous standards to our work going above and beyond regulatory requirements in many regards we also implemented the lessons we learned across our operations globally and continue to share our learnings with others it was also important to rebuild trust in the decisions we were making about bp s future we had to find a way to move from response to recovery and to be clear and transparent in our communications so as some of you will recall in 2011 we laid out our 10 point plan it included five things you could expect from bp and five things to measure us by we were already in action on many of them but this plan clearly set out how we were going to move bp forward turning next to growing shareholder value which has always been a key priority and is based upon some guiding principles which have endured and evolved with the business over time value over volume taking decisions to maximize the value we can create rather than the volume we can produce active portfolio management and following an extensive divestment program much of which was delivered in an environment of over 100 per barrel our business looks very different we think carefully about the shape and scope of our global activities divesting parts of our portfolio where we don t see a clear strategic fit or where we believe others can create more value developing long term strategic relationships we see enormous value and long term mutual relationships with partners and governments particularly as we look to focus on key geographies and establishing strong value growth opportunities in the upstream this means driving growth from high quality major projects and optimizing our existing operations in the downstream accessing growth and marketing and advantage manufacturing to deliver strong underlying growth and returns and in alternative energy deploying bp s capabilities or partnering with others to grow in low carbon businesses and raise capital finally cost and capital discipline staying disciplined around our portfolio and investments with a relentless focus on capital cost efficiency these guiding principles have been and remain good for our business and core to our strategic decision making they served us well in the immediate aftermath of the gulf of mexico oil spill they provided a set of building blocks to support our recovery and delivery of our 10 point plan they ensured our business was resilient in the face of the oil price downturn and they created the foundation which along with a greater certainty of the gulf of mexico liabilities meant that in early 2017 we were able to lay out our new strategy for getting back to growth and so here we are today we have a powerful investor proposition of growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to our shareholders over the long term we are focused on running our operations safely reliably and efficiently which i truly believe is essential for the long term success of bp we have created a business that is fit for the future shaping a distinctive portfolio over the last decade that we believe is a well positioned frame to face the rapidly changing energy landscape and we will continue to be focused on value and returns making disciplined investment decisions while also managing our costs our proposition is underpinned by the five year growth strategy we laid out in early 2017 growing advantaged oil and gas in the upstream market led growth in the downstream venturing and low carbon across multiple fronts and modernizing the whole group in service of this we have built up our businesses in existing core regions and grown businesses in new markets we ve started up 24 major projects in the upstream since 2016 including shah deniz 2 together with the southern gas corridor one of the world s biggest engineering projects we significantly transform our downstream business and are accessing new growth markets such as mexico and india we re back into solar attracting lots of capital with fast growing lightsource bp we are in biofuels in brazil and we re fast charging vehicles in the uk in the us lower 48 we completed our biggest acquisition in 20 years we ve built distinctive partnerships around the world including with rosneft in russia reliance in india and aker bp in norway and reinforced strategic relationships with governments in places such as azerbaijan oman and abu dhabi across the group we are using technology to look for new ways to build and develop distinctive capabilities for our people and our operations all of this is in support of our proposition to grow sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term and we are doing just that having today announced a dividend increase bringing our dividend for the fourth quarter to 0 105 per ordinary share or 0 63 per adr in summary we are a global integrated energy business with a strong set of capabilities global reach and a talented workforce and i believe we are in a strong position to manage our business in this fast changing energy landscape so all that leaves me to do is to hand over to brian to take you through the results in more detail brian gilvary chief financial officer thanks bob and good morning everyone looking first to highlights from the year we are in the face of a challenging macro environment we ve delivered a strong set of results for the full year we reported underlying replacement cost profit of 10 billion with strong underlying operating cash flow of 28 2 billion including a working capital release of 300 million return on average capital employed was 8 9 and over the year we paid 8 5 billion in cash dividends and share buybacks i ll talk more on our financial results shortly but first let me share some strategic and operational highlights in the upstream we started up five major projects and took five final investment decisions in the year underpinning our 2021 target and our longer term growth options bpx energy is also making good progress delivering synergies this year of 240 million above the target of 90 million we ve planned well costs continue to decline in the eagle ford and permian under bp operations and we are progressing high value high impact activities as we continue to focus on value over volume in downstream we saw record refining throughput for the second consecutive year and continue to expand our retail convenience partnership model which is now in around 1 600 sites across our network in december we signed an agreement with reliance industries to form a fuels retail and aviation joint venture in india providing access to one of the world s largest and fastest growing energy markets we are also making progress in our advanced mobility agenda forming a joint venture with didi the world s leading mobile transportation platform to develop electric vehicle charging infrastructure in china the world s largest market for electric vehicles and since announcing our new plastic recycling technology bp infinia a consortium of leading companies has been formed to help accelerate commercialization leading to reduce plastic waste supporting the circular economy more broadly we are progressing our low carbon agenda in december we increased our stake in our solar joint venture with lightsource bp to 50 and completed the formation of bp bunge bioenergia a leading company in brazil s low carbon ethanol sugar and bio power market in summary 2019 was another year of strong financial delivery we are on track to deliver our 2021 targets and we continue to explore and develop new business models to provide opportunities through the energy transition turning then to the macro environment which remains volatile in 2019 brent crude averaged 63 per barrel in the fourth quarter and 64 per barrel for the full year oil prices were volatile through the year with supply and demand impacted by changing macroeconomic and geopolitical factors slowing demand growth was largely balanced by opec plus production cuts and the deceleration in us onshore production growth in recent weeks growing concerns over the potential impact of coronavirus on economic growth and global oil demand growth have also weighed on the oil price in the short term looking further into 2020 we expect stronger oil demand growth driven by improving global economic sentiment and the impact of imo 2020 stronger non opec supply growth driven by norway brazil and canada and solid us growth is expected to support global supply with opec plus continuing to be the balancing factor turning to gas us henry hub was 2 50 per million british thermal units in the fourth quarter down 1 20 versus a year ago it averaged 2 60 in 2019 down 0 50 from the 2018 average the us gas price has been impacted by continued supply growth a mild winter and softer demand growth than that seen in 2018 we expect price to be driven by the balance between continued supply growth versus supply disruption in light of the current challenging price environment finally bp s global refining marker margin was 12 40 per barrel in the fourth quarter 1 40 high versus a year ago and down 2 30 versus the third quarter for the year the refining marker margin remained largely unchanged yet 2019 was one of the worst refining environment since the financial crisis of 2008 with other crude and product differentials outside bp s rmm significantly impacted this was largely due to global tightening and temporary disruptions in heavy and sour crude supply implementation of imo 2020 should provide support to margins and widen heavy and sour crude oil differentials this year moving to our fourth quarter results bp s fourth quarter underlying replacement cost profit was 2 6 billion compared to 3 5 billion a year ago and 2 3 billion in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter the result benefits from a lower effective tax rate higher production due to improved weather in the gulf of mexico and strong commercial performance in refining this is partly offset by lower rosneft contribution following a strong third quarter and lower refining margins compared to a year ago the result was impacted by lower heavy crude differentials and lower liquid and gas realizations partly offset by lower effective tax rates and lower refinery turnarounds and as bob mentioned the fourth quarter dividend payable in the first quarter of 2020 has been increased to 0 105 per ordinary share turning to cash flow and our sources and uses of cash excluding oil spill related outgoings underlying operating cash flow was 28 2 billion for the year of which 7 6 billion was generated in the fourth quarter this included a working capital release of 300 million for the year and a build of 200 million in the fourth quarter organic capital expenditure was 4 billion in the fourth quarter and 15 2 billion for the year at the lower end of our targeted range turning to inorganic cash flows divestments under the proceeds in 2019 totaled 2 8 billion and we made post tax gulf of mexico payments of 2 4 billion inorganic capital expenditure was 4 2 billion including the final payments to bhp of 3 5 billion in the first half of the year gearing fell in the fourth quarter to 31 1 reflecting lower net debt partly offset by the impact of share buybacks on equity and impairments as of today we have completed our share buyback program fully offsetting dilution from the scrip dividend since the third quarter of 2017 in total we have repurchased 458 million ordinary shares at a cost of 3 billion a scrip dividend alternative is not being offered in respect to the fourth quarter dividend and we do not anticipate offering a scrip election for the foreseeable future now turning to guidance and the first quarter of 2020 in the upstream we expect reported production to be lower due to the impact of our ongoing divestment program and planned seasonal maintenance and turnaround activities while in the downstream we expect lower industry refining margins and wider north american heavy crude oil discounts turning to guidance for the full year 2020 upstream underlying production excluding rosneft is expected to be lower than 2019 i ll return shortly on that point organic capital expenditure is expected to remain toward the lower end of our 15 billion to 17 billion range the dd a charge is expected to be slightly below the 2019 level reflecting the impact of divestments we expect the other businesses and corporate quarterly charge to continue to average around 350 million the underlying effective tax rate is expected to be below 40 and gulf of mexico oil spill payments are expected to reduce to below 1 billion net of tax adjustments as usual we will provide updated rules of thumb for 2020 on price movements impacts for the year and expect to publish these on our website by the end of this month i will now provide some detail on the segments and progress toward 2021 cash flow target turning firstly upstream where we continue to make progress against our 2021 production and cash flow targets we ve delivered 24 major projects since 2016 including the december start up of the alligin field in the north sea these projects range in size scope and complexity and have on average been delivered on schedule and under budget they are currently producing around 700 000 high margin barrels a day we have 11 projects to go including our west nile delta raven project which is mechanically complete but is currently addressing issues identified during commissioning the project is now forecast to start up around the end of 2020 in addition we expect to start up three further major projects in 2020 projects in the gulf of mexico and north sea will leverage existing infrastructure while in india we expect start up of the first project in the kg d6 integrated development series and is eventually expected to contribute to over 10 of the country s projected gas demand our 2021 start ups are also on track ghazeer in oman is expected to come on stream in early 2021 and boost production by 500 million cubic feet per day and is currently ahead of schedule under budget and 90 complete other material projects including mad dog phase 2 and cassia compression are also progressing well with both around 65 complete in bpx energy we continue to focus on value over volume diverting investment from high volume lower margin gas production to higher margin oil production in the permian and eagle ford basins where we continue to ramp up activity we expect full year underlying production to be lower than 2019 due to declines in lower margin gas basins we expect reported production to be lower due to the above factor and the impact of the ongoing divestment program we estimate the impact of divestments to be in the range of 200 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day to 250 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2020 of this over half comes from lower margin onshore us gas production and much of the balance from lower margin oil so while we see 2020 as a transition year we remain confident in the delivery of 14 billion to 15 billion of pre tax cash in 2021 this is driven in large part by the expected delivery of around 250 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from major projects still to come relative to 2019 most of which is due in 2021 and our target of 1 billion of free cash flow from bpx energy supported by the ramp up of liquids production and the realization of synergies which we now expect to exceed 400 million by 2021 in the downstream we continue to make strong strategic progress toward our 2021 targets in 2019 earnings stood at 6 4 billion reflecting a further 1 3 billion of underlying earnings growth in 2019 and bringing total underlying earnings growth since 2016 to 2 3 billion this puts us firmly on track to deliver our target of more than 3 billion growth by 2021 while maintaining pre tax returns of around 20 moving to free cash flow 2019 pre tax cash was 6 5 billion at our planned conditions net of capital investments of 3 billion we remain on track to deliver 9 billion to 10 billion of pre tax cash by 2021 with the drivers of this growth being firstly a recovery of crude and product differentials which impacted our 2019 results by around 1 billion as i ve already mentioned last year was one of the worst refining environment we have seen since the financial crisis we expect differentials to widen and already see evidence of this in 2020 with north american sour crude and brent euros differentials back above our 2020 and 2021 planning assumptions partly reflecting the introduction of imo 2020 regulations second we expect lower turnaround levels in both 2020 and 2021 following record activity over the last two years as we optimize our schedule to capture opportunities in the imo 2020 changes and finally we expect further underlying earnings organic growth from each of our businesses in fuels marketing continue to grow our differentiated retail offer and scale up of our new market entries while developing ev positions across china uk and germany in refining delivering around 1 billion of further earnings growth over the next few years from our business improvement plans and digital operations in lubricants increasing growth market exposure and premium lubricants while diversifying into adjacent market spaces and dv products in petrochemicals selectively investing in attractive and growing market developing technologies to lead the market in circularity as with bp infinia across the downstream we have a strong track record of underlying earnings growth delivering more than 5 billion of earnings growth over the last five years looking forward we have a clear strategy with a focused activity set that underpins the growth momentum to 2021 this progress in the upstream and downstream gives us the confidence that we are on track to deliver our 2021 group targets we are staying disciplined with our capital and maintaining annual organic capital spend within a 15 billion to 17 billion range we remain confident that return on average capital employed will exceed 10 by 2021 applying conditions on divestments we have now announced 9 4 billion since the start of 2019 of the 10 billion package which we now expect to increase to 15 billion by mid 2021 net debt fell by 1 billion in the fourth quarter and with further proceeds received we expect net debt to continue to decline and gearing to move toward the middle of the range of 20 to 30 through this year assuming recent average oil prices in summary strong operational momentum is driving growing free cash flow we remain confident in delivering the 2021 free cash flow targets and divestment proceeds are expect to continue to reduce net debt and gearing taken together this underpins our announcement today of an increase in the dividend to 0 105 per share and our ongoing commitment to sustainably growing distributions to shareholders over the long term let me now hand over to bernard who will conclude today s presentation bernard looney chief executive upstream thanks brian i m conscious i m another voice in the room today and i won t talk for long but i wanted to be here for three reasons first it s been quite a year for bp and another strong year of strategic delivery and progress against the targets we have laid out for 2021 i m really proud of where bp is today we re in excellent shape secondly it s a time of change tomorrow is my first day in the job an opportunity i never foresaw 20 years ago when i joined bp but an opportunity i m obviously very excited about i look forward to talking and meeting with many of you in the coming weeks months and years and of course bob is stepping down as chief executive today i want to personally acknowledge bob and all that he has done for bp as well as the support he has given me over the years in many ways bp wouldn t be the company it is today were it not for bob and the leadership he has shown over the past decade he leaves bp with a strong foundation governed by a set of values and behaviors that define who we are and competing again with real strategic momentum and a focus on growing value i have some big shoes to fill as you are also aware brian has elected to retire and murray is set to take over at the start of july brian has been the key architect behind bp s financial framework and the progress we have made in this respect i m delighted he is staying on through the middle of the year and supported the transition and we will have a chance to acknowledge brian in the coming months the third reason i wanted to join the call was reassurance i want to reassure you of my personal commitment to some of our fundamental principles that are unchanged and will remain unchanged when we host our capital markets day later this year our commitment to safe and reliable operations our commitment to our investor proposition growing sustainable free cash flow and distributions to shareholders over the long term our commitment to maintaining a strong financial frame including the absolute focus on deleveraging the balance sheet and importantly confidence in the delivery of our 2021 proxy free cash flow targets with capital discipline at its core i ll talk more about this in my broader ambition for bp going forward next week and beyond that we will start to work toward hosting the capital markets day we have a lot to do to get ready for that in the meantime let me close by thanking bob again for all he has done for this company bob we will miss you thank you for listening i m going to leave you in the capable hands of bob brian and craig to host the usual q a session and i look forward to talking with many of you on the 12th of february questions and answers operator craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you again everybody for listening good morning we re going to turn to questions and answers as usual if you can limit your questions to no more than two so everybody gets a chance to ask on that note let s take the first question from lydia rainforth at barclays good morning lydia lydia rainforth barclays analyst thank you and good morning and bob thank you to you as well i ve two questions if i could and the first one if i just think back over the last 10 years period of safety improvement that you talked about and then the modernization of bp are you surprised at how quickly the business was able to modernize and confidence that gives you about what can happen going forward and then the second question was a little bit more specific around the low carbon businesses that obviously we start to go back into how do you think about whether bp can make money and deliver competitive returns is it a case of looking at cost of capital for those business is in a slight different way thanks bob dudley group chief executive well thank you lydia and thank you for all of your good questions over the years your first one about safety and modernization i have to say if you were in the company it didn t feel like it was so quick because it s really been it was many years of small changes including shutting down our facilities around the world and turning them around and retooling things and getting the culture speaking up and measuring everything i think i don t think it was that quick but i think it was very very thorough and i think it s now firmly embedded in the culture and then with modernization i mean i do think we ve very early on embraced i mean sort of big words out there big data but we really did begin working with some great third parties to work on the big data which also combines of course with safety but also optimization of reservoirs and how we produce all kinds of things and this has been steady and it s accelerated in the second half of this last decade so thanks i think we do have a culture that is firmly got to tie on safety and always thinking about how to modernize things on the low carbon side we ve made some big steps we always even through the gulf of mexico retained our wind business retained and began the biofuels businesses we did move out of solar for a while and in some ways it s remarkable that we kept not only some of the businesses but all the talent around low carbon i think i hear people say well you only invest 3 of your capital on low carbon but this is where i think it would be good for many of you as you think about these business models like the one at lightsource bp which is 50 50 bp with lightsource acquiring and taking from one country to 10 countries and has attracted somewhere between 5 billion and 7 billion of capital in that business and we taken it around the world and you look at the economics of that i use solar for example in our operations which means we replace maybe burning gas that can be sold molecules for the country we re in so it s a you have to look at sort of corporate economics around it and i think we get better and better and better and more efficient bp bunge has got a great future the combinations in brazil 11 mills in a country that we ll use the ethanol and the sugar for all kinds of things so i think you re right there has to be good return on capital on it but let me ask brian to add to that brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah no i think that s a good summary bob and what i d say lydia the way we think about it at the moment is we will have in some respects just like we ve done through every energy transition as we re moving into new products and new sources of value we may do some of that off balance sheet which is what you ve seen around lightsource bp and bp bunge in terms of what we re doing bp bunge in terms of brazil equally things will come back on to the balance sheet at which point where we think there is a viable business going forward there is no question we ve seen a rapid move in the market over the last three or four years solar now is very economic and you can see that we will continue to see the investments in smaller ventures which will give us all sorts of information about how this energy market will transform and i d also remind you for example wind is currently on balance sheet sits inside our books and is very economic and makes a good return with the tax credits that come with it in the united states so i think it s looking for things which are complementary to what we do and moving things both off and on balance sheet as we go forward but i think it s a great time as bernard steps in i think it s a really exciting opportunity for us in terms of what some of those opportunities might look like lydia rainforth barclays analyst thank you very much craig marshall group head of investor relations thank you lydia we re going to take the next question from alastair syme at citi alastair alastair syme citigroup analyst good morning thank you everyone couple of questions one on the bpx business you previously talked about 1 billion of free cash flow up from this business by 2021 so i m just trying to figure out what the 2019 baseline is in that and how it gets bridged if you could help split between synergies and growth and my follow up is really just to ask about mauritania senegal there s a lot of exploration work in 2019 so i just wanted to get a status of where that asset is and when should we expect the next project to mature to fid thank you brian gilvary chief financial officer thanks alastair so i ll just pick up the first question around bpx everything is on track in terms of the 1 billion of free cash by 2021 activity we ve ramped down in the haynesville as we ve ramped up in the eagle ford and permian as more takeaway capacity comes through the synergy number we d now expect to be significantly higher than we first set and i think as i already laid out for you we re over 3 times the level we thought we d be at this point in terms of 2019 but everything is on track and the great thing about our new position we ve now pretty much sold out of all of the gas assets which is what you saw come through as the final impairment charge that we saw around those packages there is one small package left to do but pretty much everything is an around that the focus now for dave and the team is absolutely on the oil business and everything we see gives us confidence in that 1 billion but that s absolutely a promise that you should expect to see delivered next year and of course we have the flexibility through this year as to how we ramp activity up depending on what the price signals are that we see from the marketplace and it s worth just pointing out that on the gas side we ve seen something like a 40 drop across the sector in the gas rig count year on year and about 25 of all the gas you see in the united states comes from associated oil and that s started to taper off a little bit at the back end of last year but we will be able to ramp that activity up as opportunities arise alastair syme citigroup analyst brian can i just ask if the business if you strip out the acquisition cost if it was free cash positive in 2019 brian gilvary chief financial officer we wouldn t normally give you that specific level of detail alastair but we ll come back to you before the end of the call but we don t normally provide that it s a choice because it will ultimate the capital we did ramp capital down in 2019 to somewhere around about 2 billion that we talked about at 3q we were planning on something around close to 2 5 billion but i think it would be too early all the synergies will come through this year given where the run rate was as we exit this year and now we re expecting synergies somewhere close to 400 million so i would anticipate it will certainly be 1 billion surplus next year but we wouldn t normally give specific guidance around 19 bob dudley group chief executive and alastair this is bob on mauritania senegal those of you who know this project it s clearly got the potential to be a long term large integrated lng business with tens of tcf of gas have been discovered the fid which we announced in december 18 is in place the interstate cooperation agreements between the two governments of senegal and mauritania has been ratified the unitization has been ratified and the sales and purchase agreement for the lng should be coming along really any time now and the so phase 1 in execution the planned phases 2 and 3 which are progressing through their optimization right now so that project is on track i ve got a lot of faith in it alastair syme citigroup analyst great thank you very much craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thanks alastair we ll take the next question from os clint at bernstein os oswald clint sanford c bernstein analyst thank you good morning everyone yeah perhaps first question i just wanted to ask about the dividend i guess i walked away from 3q thinking gearing levels above 30 is a tough level to talk about the dividend hike in terms your board meeting so i just wondered if you could share a bit more color about what happened in this quarter s meetings surrounding the dividend and is it really just confidence in the 2021 delivery which brian has actually spoken to this morning but have you really interrogated all of the assumptions that underpin upstream and downstream delivery here because obviously there are some other companies out there that get 12 months away and start to worry about macro affecting their kind of end period targets that s the first question and then secondly and thank you very much bob for all your time over the last couple of years i wanted to ask you as we think about the value proposition with the reliance downstream marketing venture now from here if you could just perhaps reflect on the upstream reliance deal i guess you did it almost a decade ago if that deal delivered everything you thought it would if anything went wrong or slower and if there s any lessons learned that we should take from that and kind of transplant into the downstream venture thank you bob dudley group chief executive thanks oswald our partnership with reliance has been great i mean i made no secret about the fact that i was disappointed really with the indian government at that time for not sort of following through on what i would call the market gas pricing which was clearly part of the contract so it took some patience and perseverance however we ve since gone out and found more gas around there we just shut down the production facilities in d6 to be able to bring on now shortly march or april the new production for the satellite fields around it so significant production will come back on stream so that s all been really well engineered and cost effective program i think for the lessons learned there and i remain very optimistic about india as a country where you can argue that growth but roughly 6 growth i think in one of the largest countries in the world just beginning to travel in many ways we look at the downstream jv as not just one on liquid fuels but also mobility we ll take all the things that we re working on electrification of vehicles as well as liquid fuels marketing convenience marketing with a great partner who has all this wire broadband it up so that it will be fast and quick a lot of efficiencies because reliance is quite a talented company as well so we ll rebrand it it will be called jio bp which i m told in hindi means long life bp but it s a combination of course of the two companies the commitment is there we should close that deal here in the first half of the year brian gilvary chief financial officer and then coming back to the question on dividend os i mean i think a lot s changed between 3q and 4q around uncertainty in terms of the outlook vis a vis balance sheet i think firstly to start with we laid out you know the target in 2017 out to 2021 that had significant surplus free cash that s unified 6 billion over and above the 8 billion dividend that we have today and we moved on the dividend as part of that strategy in 2q 18 so we re in the sort of the right postcode in terms of timing around dividend the uncertainty around 3q i think what we ve seen through the fourth quarter is a major de risking of the uncertainty around balance sheet which investors have said quite clearly too is they re looking for us to de risk the balance sheet and i think the combination of a strong set of earnings in 4q strong operating cash in 4q we ve now announced 9 4 billion of the 10 billion package that we said we ll be doing over 19 and 20 so as a year a year early and only 2 8 billion of cash came in around that package in 2019 so the balance you d expect the majority of the balance with some payments out to 2021 to come through in 2020 we have also announced the further package of 5 billion which we expect to announce by the mid 2021 capex is at the low end of the range net debt came down by over 1 billion in the fourth quarter and one of the important measures was gearing came down from 31 7 at 3q down to 31 1 in spite of 2 billion of impairments associated with some of the lower 48 gas sales just shy of 2 billion so i think all of the outlook look far more positive the link back to macro we worry less about if you remember what we laid out in 2017 was a 55 a barrel brent real so we ve been in the sort of 60 65 range we ll come back to that in terms of what the macro outlook looks like there is no question coronavirus i suspect will impact demand this year we re currently seeing for the year something around 300 000 barrels a day to 500 000 barrels a day impact on demand growth that we were looking at around 1 2 coming into this year and of course that will unfold as the year progresses it may be more or less than that but that would be our current estimations and then the question will be whether opec balances or not but just reflecting on the last 10 years i mean it s sort of relevant i think vis a vis bob s tenure we ve dealt with oil prices that have gone from 100 a barrel to 28 a barrel so we have the flexibility to react what we laid out for you in 17 was the strategy out to 2021 where we d be able to manage the downsides and the upsides in the last two or three quarters certainly through last year we had the benefit of upside in oil prices oil prices may stay around 55 in the prompt right now given what we re seeing around coronavirus but they may regrow back by the end of the year but i think we ll see how that plays out but from our perspective there is no question now you can see probably somewhere in the range of 7 billion to 9 billion of cash from divestment proceeds coming through this year if you think about the balance of 6 6 billion of the 9 4 billion we ve already announced say 40 of the balance of the 5 billion to come through maybe this year it sort of says the backdrop is positive and we ve got growing free cash flow out to 2021 and so i think when we look to that in the round especially the strong set of 4q results and the further 5 billion package that we announced was sufficient to justify the dividend move now oswald clint sanford c bernstein analyst excellent thank you thank you both craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you os we ll take the next question from irene himona irene good morning irene himona societe generale analyst good morning thank you and bob congratulations on a job well done and all the best for the future so i had two questions first of all 2019 reserve replacement 67 i wanted to ask is this metric as relevant to bp these days as it used to be are you striving consciously to replace reserves in a world where there is an energy transition and we are looking at peak oil at some point so how should we think of bp s exploration effort and future reserve replacement ambitions and then my second question for brian so in q4 underlying tax 27 and for the full year 35 5 so well below your guidance and indeed as we saw in q3 well below your expectations and i think you attribute that in the press release to lower deferred tax can you just help us understand what were the key drivers let s say the key unanticipated drivers that led to such a discrepancy between your expectations and the actual for the year thank you brian gilvary chief financial officer so maybe if i just take the tax question first it was indeed deferred taxes and actually in q3 remember we talked about we were expecting taxes to be very high the big change is the mix and if you look at it yeah we just gone now and look what do we think the tax will look like for 2020 of course we ve got big swings in profit mix in terms of downstream to upstream and then within the upstream depending on what prices are doing so it s really hard to try and come up with an estimate ahead of time we started to give guidance along the lines we did when we did the abu dhabi deal because of course the high tax barrels that come with that which moved our overall tax rate up from a long term historic level of about 32 to something north of 40 we ve done the roll up now for next gen we ve tried to give you guidance here that it s somewhere probably below 40 next year i would say the range about where we ve actually come out this year around 35 36 to 40 is a sort of good range number but there is such a huge swing irene in terms of the balance of profits between upstream and downstream and the tax characteristics of those the big difference in 4q was really around deferred taxes specific assets that roll forward and of course you ve also got the impacts of some of the impairments as well that come through that move the tax number around but even at the end of 3q we wouldn t have anticipated tax to be as low as it has come through in the fourth quarter bob dudley group chief executive thanks brian and thank you irene thank you for your comment as well on reserve replacement ratio we have focus for some time now and value over volume but a year or so ago we removed reserve replacement ratio from our compensation metrics over the last five years we ve had a rolling average of 97 in terms of reserve replacement ratio this last year 67 a little lower we had fewer major development sanctions than typical in 2019 than we ve had in the past the reserves are still healthy our reserve production ratio rp ratio still just around 14 years but i think the idea of being driven for just reserve replacement ratio is not how we will drive bp going forward it doesn t mean we re not going to though add reserves we still have a whole set of projects out going on we can see till 2025 but i feel that it s the kind of reserves you add whether it s gas advantage oil advantage gas got to be a key and that s i m sure will drive our project sanctions irene himona societe generale analyst thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations thanks irene we ll take the next question from jon rigby at ubs jon good morning jon rigby ubs investment bank analyst hi good morning yeah thank you and to drill down on that reserve replacement question little bit i noticed exploration charge both the write off of carry forward and also the activity in the quarter has been dropping it looks now like a pattern maybe two to three years so i just wondered is that reflective of some strategic decision making around what you want to do around exploration and then the second question is you ve had a couple of i think comparatively in comparative quarters some very good trading results or you don t call it out this quarter but i do notice that your inventory run by rmi is quite high for 4q in absolute terms and if relative to the oil price very high so i just wondered whether you able to characterize what you were doing and whether that is reflective of activity in the fourth quarter around trading thanks brian gilvary chief financial officer okay jon i ll take the trading question first yeah rmi was driven up is actually by higher volumes that we were carrying through the year end and by higher prices so that s pretty much and that will swing around depending on activity but we were carrying higher volumes through the end of the year in terms of performance of the business it was a strong quarter for gas it was a more probably below average certainly and below plan for the fourth quarter for trading for oil which is really the big swings that we saw in the last sort of 10 15 days of the quarter but overall for oil trading and gas trading they both had record years in 2019 and certainly a strong set of results as we ve seen in recent years and certainly over the last decade so a lot of things went in the right direction some quarters were stronger some were weaker for each of them but overall it s been a busy year for the trading business but the rmi activity was really about volumes and it s about higher prices bob dudley group chief executive and jon you were asking yeah drilling down on exploration i mean we are still clearly continuing to explore we ve drilled exploration wells this year two of them in egypt gulf of mexico four of them in trinidad we ve had three announced discoveries so far this year we ve got whole plan of exploration going on forward and in terms of fids we see about 10 projects in 20 and 21 that we would consider fid coming down the pipe we haven t announced which projects exactly but they are spread across the world and go into the gulf of mexico trinidad and we ve got in 20 and then we ve got about seven others that move around from angola to the north sea australia senegal couple in the gulf of mexico and maybe one in egypt so we will continue to explore i m not sure if that exactly got to your question jon rigby ubs investment bank analyst it was really just whether this is just a reoptimizing of risk as you sort of enter into the 2020s and kind of how you apply your capital to exploration but i think that captures it thank you and just also to add my thanks to you for the past 10 years and good luck in the retirement brian gilvary chief financial officer well thank you jon and i ll just add to that to your point yes we will recharacterize exploration and risk and think about exploration combined with access which often doesn t necessarily require exploration drilling we ve been steadily reducing our exploration now for a number of years and we will keep doing that we ll focus a lot on as you all know ilx or infrared let exploration in our existing businesses focusing around where we already have the facilities most certainly thanks jon jon rigby ubs investment bank analyst thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you jon we ll take the next question from chris kuplent at bank of america chris chris copeland bank of america analyst thank you very much and can i just echo bob and brian thank you for all your help over the years just two two quick questions i hope the 2020 production outlook you ve given of course our production will be impacted by disposals but you already pointing at an underlying decline as well and you were referring to low gas margin basins does that refer explicitly to bpx or others as well so any bit of color would be would be helpful and secondly a bit of a wider question you said you completed the buyback program what do you see the role of buybacks within your progressive distribution policy going forward thank you bob dudley group chief executive okay chris if i just take the first part of that reported production i think we ve said already today you will see about 200 000 250 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that we ve disposed out of the asset base so you ll see that come through this year which is why reported is lower in terms of underlying you ve got lower activity in haynesville so you think from a value of a volume perspective that s a good thing so the rig count stands i think just one rig or two rigs i think it s about one rig now then haynesville so that will be lower underlying production there were lower volumes coming out of trinidad to do with some infill wells we have and of course you ve also got the impact of raven being delayed out to the back end of this year from last year which we would have anticipated as part of the in line growth this year but they are the three major drivers of why the underlying number will be slightly down in terms of distributions the buyback is now complete in terms of what the script that we ve issued since the third quarter 2017 so that was a big signal which i probably should have alluded to earlier having that also behind us i mean there is two things which have helped with the balance sheet there is completing the buyback which i think there has been good we promised to do that and we ve done it and the second thing of course is deepwater horizon payments are now down to below 1 billion a year around 1 billion a year post tax out to 2032 so that s taken a big piece of risk off the balance sheet in terms of further buybacks i think all option is wrote within the financial frame especially given where the equity value sit today there is no question that s an attractive proposition but that s really one for the broader financial frame conversation with the board as we progress through this year and bernard will lay out next week his ambition for the company going forward but i think buybacks will always be an opportunity in terms of our armory of things we can do around distributions especially when we think the equity value of the company is significantly over valued above where we see the market trading chris copeland bank of america analyst okay thank you bob dudley group chief executive thanks chris craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you chris we will take the next question from thomas adolff at credit suisse thomas thomas adolff credit suisse analyst good morning two questions from me as well please firstly a few years ago you had a number of gaps in your upstream portfolio and they included the permian and brazil and subsequently you filled them i was wondering if you can give us an update on brazil it s gone quiet somewhat and whether you re overall happy with the portfolio you have today obviously suriname and guyana seems to be getting quite hot and then secondly on russia bob you have a very long history working in russia starting with amoco then with tnk bp and then of course today with bp and rosneft and i understand that this partnership with rosneft is very important to you and you emphasized the importance of partnerships and relationships on today s call and i m not sure if bernard is on the call for the q a but if he is i was wondering whether bernard can talk to us about the strategic rationale to have this stake in rosneft and what it brings to bp and whether it differentiates your investment proposition thank you bob dudley group chief executive thomas i ll comment on brazil and then russia and let brian also add to that so in brazil we ve we re happy we ve got a very big integrated business now in brazil it s not only the exploration side but we ve got biofuels air bp the jet fuel trading operations and supplying and working with a power plant there for the use of gas on the exploration side we ve got some good acreage yet to be drilled we had first well back in the first quarter of 19 it was a disappointment we ve been very very careful in terms of adding to that i think that we ll see exploration not sure we have stepped back from some of the programs here like the transfer of rights programs there because it just looked pricey for us so we re going to be very very capital disciplined about what we re doing there but it s obviously a great province for energy going forward on russia i ll just say russia is really important to bp i ll let brian give a perspective so that you know it s not just mine because brian or bernard is not here although of course we ve talked to bern obviously over the years to me it is a great partnership it s been a hard one and it s strategic i think it s got enormous optionality not only just for the shareholding in rosneft but also the joint venture projects that we ve worked with and are working and producing from with rosneft but brian brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah no i mean we ve been in russia for over 30 years the current version of that looks very positive from bp s perspective rosneft is probably one of our deepest most important strategic relationships bob has built that up over time i was on the tnk board myself for the best part of 10 years so i know a lot about russia and the challenges and the opportunities which have come with it i think we think about russia strategically in terms of rosneft and that relationship you have to remember because it s some i mean i think there was some commentary at the weekend about linking this to climate change and to energy transition i d just remind people that russia is signed up to the paris climate accord they are doing a lot in terms of the energy transition they ve also signed up to the un sustainability goals and they re one of the largest oil and gas provinces in the world so i think it is incredibly important for bp that we continue to deepen that relationship that we have today and i think the things that bob and the team have been able to do in terms of and with bernard the additional joint ventures we now have on the ground as bp in places like taz which are now generating revenues and production for us and i d also say while the ownership of rosneft is an investment in the company and that pays us a dividend that dividend underpins 10 of our own dividend and is very important for us going forward so i think and than usual report the idea that rosneft will be non strategic for us in this next decade i ve got absolutely no founding at all and we just still see it as a very important relationship going forward and i think i can probably say on the call if bernard was here he was in russia in the last few weeks to cement those relationships going forward bob dudley group chief executive and i would for those you and many of you maybe don t follow rosneft but it s worth looking at because that company is transforming itself it s a little bit like as tnk changed over the years the emphasis on safety efficiency modernization reductions of corrosion base lining their flaring and greatly reducing their flaring they are doing all the right things that you would expect and so i think it s it s a company that is slightly constrained because of the opec plus agreements but they ve got developments down the road great projects ahead of it and so it s not just a passive investment we work closely with them on all fronts thomas adolff credit suisse analyst great thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you thomas we ll take the next question from jason kenney at santander jason jason kenney santander analyst hi good morning and thanks for the opportunity well all the best for your retirement i m looking forward to the book of your time associated with bp should be fascinating if every year in embra definitely is available i ve got a couple of questions firstly what s happening in iraq i think the kirkuk expansion plans have stalled and any insights as to where you think that can go over the next five 10 years would be interesting and then secondly on the recycling start ups the position you re taking with unilever and danone to look at recycling at plastics what kind of scale do you think that can grow to and over which geographies in the next decade or so thanks bob dudley group chief executive thanks jason i think i ll take you up on the v dram i m not sure about the book i don t think i read through your book but i d like to say i think there s a lot of things in your question there so kirkuk in iraq i would say kirkuk is in hibernation for us we ve stopped we ve done a lot of work there it s a big field it s in quite tricky geography and sort of stands between northern iraq or kurdistan and southern iraq and the differences between the companies to me someday kirkuk will be some sort of key to solving some of the political or maybe being a union point politically but just not now for bp the southern fields rumaila continue to operate safely with lots of vigilance there we still have staff there and that s going fine rumaila is just a key field for the iraqi government supplies about 40 of the money to their treasury but on kirkuk i think i would stay tuned but it s going to be a long way i think now on recycling brian you are working with that brian gilvary chief financial officer yes sure and i think it s thanks for asking the question actually had a somebody from another chemical company talked to me recently about it about how impressed they were with this i mean this is a big breakthrough it s a technology bp infinia that processes polyester plastics particularly items that are difficult to recycle today and the consortium we put in place includes exactly companies like you ve said to known unilever britvic the packaging recycling specialist is in there as well in terms of our plan and remind us in terms of the management recycling specialists in terms of dealing with the recycling side of this i think it s a massive opportunity it s something like 25 million that we re putting into a plant in naperville that will test out the technology and then we ll look in terms of full scale commercialization optimization i think it s a huge opportunity for us it is that the pilot plant stage that we ll be looking to build this to sort of see if we can make this commercial but i think in terms of if you think about all the things we ve talked about in the venture space this is an example of a technology we developed in house that could have major potential scale up but it s really too early to say at this point but all the indications are very positive and if you look at the consortium we ve put together and the sort of brands that we re talking about and i think that will gives you an indication of just what the potential might look like so it s a great example of technology in action within the business and coming from not the areas that we would normally talk about but if you think about the circularity economy to underpin the circularity economy that s a big part of it jason kenney santander analyst thanks craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you jason i ll take you up on your dram as well let s move to christian malek at jpmorgan christine christian malek jpmorgan analyst thanks craig it s great to finally see the dividend raise and even better to see that s on a 55 per barrel breakeven for 19 so with that in mind to what extent will be continuing to focus on delivering a lower cash breakeven to stay competitive within the macro frame that continues to be volatile and how should we think about the critical path to raise dividends further given you ve chosen to raise even with the gearing is above 30 still secondly a question on scaling up new energies in capital investment what i appreciate is much to look forward to presenting the policy carbon knife i m just not sure how to solve for that effectively working and investing more in non oil energy solutions while gearing does remain so high and with a higher dividend going forward do you think bp has a capital frame to really drive a realistic plan to invest materially in clean energy or is wholly dependent on your success of divestments so do we need a massive portfolio reshaping is basically what i m asking i m sorry to make a third apologies but i just want to echo comments to thank you for your graciousness and humility in helping guide us through some very challenging times two qualities that are greatly if i may be permitted to say while we still have it would be great if you could share what were the lessons learned from the 10 year bp and advice it gives in new management team and this community especially concerns around the future fossil fuels continue to mount thank you brian gilvary chief financial officer thanks christian so first on the dividend and i think just to make it clear it was a move in seeing the trajectory of the gearing coming down to the fourth quarter that allowed us to make the move gearing has stayed up where it was or even gone higher off the back of the equity write offs i think its going to be a more difficult decision if you look through though something in the tune of 7 billion to 9 billion of cash coming through this year in deals that we re pretty much done or we re fairly confident we ll get done through this year on a risk basis and the fact the capex the bottom end of the 15 million to 17 million range that we set for 2021 we have majorly de risked the balance sheet coming into this year which i think gave the board the confidence to move the dividend the way we have in the fourth quarter the breakeven of 35 to 40 a barrel still holds true for 2021 in terms of the targets of course it moves toward 40 the more that we distribute now through dividends of course that s a measure based on where how much dividend you paid out so now we re paying out a high dividend we re not issuing scrip you move toward the top end of that range obviously as we start to distribute but now this year we will be somewhere around mid 50s breakeven for the corporation remember deepwater horizon which was 19 billion of cash was paid out over the last four years we ve absorbed 10 billion or 10 25 billion purchase of bhp in total at 30 billion of cash over the last four years and certainly the 10 billion over the last couple of years i think we re in a very positive position vis a vis where the balance sheet is and the trajectory through the first and second quarter this year so i think that does give us confidence 2021 looks well underpinned and we did premise that 2021 targets around further distribution to shareholders so i think we have a much clear runway vis a vis the things that we can control the thing we can control of course is the environment and as you saw through 15 16 17 we have a company that is flexible enough to deal with that in pretty much all the scenarios that you could sell to paying down craig marshall group head of investor relations thanks brian and christian thank you for your kind comments there and i ll maybe just a few things to think about in terms of lessons and you all cover energy and oil and gas which i think is one of the world s longest wavelength investment cycles so that s what we are working in and i think some of the things around that is because they are such long term they do i do think of bp we do relationships not transactions because it s essential in such a long wavelength business some lessons learned and you all will know this culture is critical in any company in almost any industry and in our case safety discipline around what we do and being a good partner it s just really important and i think patience and perseverance in almost any difficult time step by step there are no silver bullets and not allowing anyone to believe that there is a silver bullet in it this is very important and i just noticed that today one thing i m always struck by in terms of investing i always go back to the fundamentals and i would say right now we re in a world where sentiment seems to be more important than the fundamentals and i think in reality always have to get back to the fundamentals including in the new energy transitions and how we do it to maintain a successful long company that continues with its shareholder distributions and one thing i always learned i learned it the hard way actually in russia but all of us in the company our shareholders ourselves so we need to learn to make sure we spend the company s money as if it s your money and shareholders and that s a fundamental thing we ve tried to drive in our own employees but kind of rambling now christian so next question bob dudley group chief executive and christian just to finish off on your question around capital frame i think 2021 is underpinned we ve got 15 billion to 17 billion frame toward the bottom end of that range now given the capital efficiency the bernard and marine the team have been driving in the upstream in particular and i think you ll see more to follow on that next week bernard will come out with his ambition for the company of the next phase of what that will look like that will then set a frame in a direction for probably a capital markets day at the back end of this year where we then talk about 2025 targets and what the capital frame looks like around that but i think certainly without wishing to see i think more you know more of the same on capital discipline is almost certainly coming as he talks about the future craig marshall group head of investor relations great thank you christian thanks for the questions we ll take the next question from martijn rats at morgan stanley martijn martijn rats morgan stanley analyst yes hi hello and also for me a congratulations with the successful and very long standing career and i appreciate all the guidance over the last couple of years i had two very short questions can you brief on the raven project i understand it s a year delayed but could you elaborate a little bit sort of why that is because this was a project that was sort of reiterated to be reiterated to be on track for start up in 2019 so a bit more color would be appreciated and the second thing i wanted to ask is about the us so bpx the 4q 18 over 4q 19 still showed about a 10 decline in production cost per barrel and i was wondering if you could comment on your ability to continue to drive cost there or whether we should expect the return of some inflation in the us shale patch that ll be much appreciated thank you bob dudley group chief executive thanks martijn and maybe just on raven i know if bernard was here he would tell you how disappointed he is and the team are and it s couched in the what has been a really good run three or four years of projects coming in below cost on budget and in some cases ahead of schedule this one is delayed this delayed significantly and it s pretty much a function of some corrosion issues that we ve picked up as part of the commissioning it s going to take longer to resolve than we would have liked bernard himself has talked about it and how this a point of view is in where we are nevertheless it won t impact 2021 which i think is important it s going to affect 2020 obviously but we should be able to get full ramp by as we commission toward the end of this year into 2021 so the 2021 targets are underpinned but it s effectively around some corrosion issues around the installation that we have and the team have to deal with and then in terms of bpx activity as i said earlier we are on track in terms of delivering 1 billion of surplus free cash we ll give you a bigger update on the first quarter around where we are around the next phase of synergies there is no question that we ll see more costs cost reductions coming in as part of that synergy number but i think 1q will give us a chance to give you an update more fully on where we are with bpx now that we ve got activity ramping in terms of the eagle ford and permian less so in haynesville as i said earlier martijn rats morgan stanley analyst all right thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations okay we ll take the next question from lucas herrmann at exane lucas lucas herrmann exane analyst good afternoon good morning bob and brian just to reiterate the comments of others thanks very much bob to help guide these persistent over the years two modest questions if i might the first was just typically this time if you could give us a better idea of what s going on in the fuels retailing business where in a profit might have been so really just if you could disclose what the full year break out of numbers in that business were and secondly i just wondered if you could comment on the lng trading business at all not least given the stock report and incremental volumes that you ll start to see the extent to which those volumes and the volumes are effectively underpinned by forward sales into end markets that s it thank you bob dudley group chief executive yes so in terms of lng you know we ran the portfolio it s about two thirds equity one third merchant or commercial no significant equity volumes to come on this year other than the ramp up of existing lng that we have so it s really around the short term loans that we have we ve got some exports coming out of the united states if they flow at these levels i think what you re going to see in the first half of this year coming out of mall winter lucas in the states the prices going to remain pretty soft at the levels that we see today we think that will clear up by the time we get to the sort of back end of this year so you ll start to see some underpinning on the gas price but i think we re pretty much held a position which is that we were pretty breakeven third quarter we talked about this been pretty bearish gas prices certainly through 2020 and the question is do you start to recover in 2021 or 2023 given the two effects of gas being backed up in the united states and big lng projects around the world coming on where we will be moving some of those volumes to our merchant business but i think you re lng is all about in terms of lng trading it s all about the optionality and making sure that we retain those options with different price points that allows the team to optimize the way they have and had a very successful year last year brian gilvary chief financial officer and thanks lucas a few things on the downstream we ve had a good track record of growth 2019 earnings were 2 7 billion pre tax returns of more than 30 plans are to grow earnings by another greater than 1 4 billion from 2016 to 2021 i mean really our focus is on the differentiated retail it s the most material part of the fuels marketing we try to develop strong market positions the brand the distinctive offers the retail network has grown quite a bit we ve had 1 2 billion in non fuel gross margin as well we re up over 10 million customers a day we ve got a 20 premium fuel volumes growth since the active fuels were launched last spring or in the spring of 2016 we have built up these strategic convenience partnerships like we have m s in the uk and others in germany and the netherlands 1 600 of those by the end of 19 we ve got 1 250 retail sites in new markets such as mexico indonesia and china we ve got over 520 in mexico and more than doubled the volumes in 2019 so these are working well mexico has really been a success as that despite what you think about what s happening in the country that has been very successful and then of course in december of 19 we signed the agreements with reliance to form that big fuels retail and aviation jv across india which immediately on closing will provide about 1 400 1 500 sites that we hope to grow to 5 500 across the highways of india over the next five years so i could go on with things lucas herrmann exane analyst sorry to interrupt and to push in terms of the financials coming out bottom line either what typically would have broken out a number of this year or the performance of the retail business as in split from refining i think last year it was 2 8 billion of ebit do you have a number for this year or should i talk to ir later brian gilvary chief financial officer lucas you can pick it up later but i think there is continued underlying growth in ebit it s coming out of places like mexico where we are still growing the new market entry there but we ll come back we ll circle back at the end of the call the actual figure at the moment around 2019 i think the cumulative now is some think north of 0 5 billion for this year but will need to come back and confirm that which will be through ir lucas herrmann exane analyst okay that s great thank you and thanks for everything again craig marshall group head of investor relations thanks lucas okay we ll take the next question from peter low at redburn peter peter low redburn analyst hi thanks for taking my question you re guiding to capex being at the lower end of the 15 billion to 17 billion range again in 2020 is that a decision you ve taken based on the current commodity price environment and can you perhaps give us some color on why the flex has come from i e why have you chosen to the rephase or the first you could have done thanks brian gilvary chief financial officer i mean i think actually look this is more of the same in terms of bernard and upstream if you remember when we set up 2021 targets upstream had a range of 13 billion to 14 billion of capital which you know it s always hindsight of wonderful thing but back in 17 we would have anticipated by now would be at the top end of the range what we ve been doing in the upstream particular is continuing to drive capital efficiency capex in 19 was down to below 12 billion in upstream set against 13 14 we set it s about capital efficiency i think as you see bernard go from chief executive upstream to chief executive company you re going to see more drive on capital efficiency i think bernard would say we will see it is more that can be done in the upstream so the actual summation of where we ve come out even having absorbed the capital now for bhp and the bhp bpx transaction that we did that will comfortably be down toward the bottom end of the range and in some respects that s not so much set by the macro it s a function of where we are in terms of the sort of 12 quarters into the 20 quarter strategy and it creates some flexibility from a risk perspective if we see a series downside to the oil price over the next six to nine months depending on what happens with coronavirus so i think it s the it s a conservative assumption i think it s the right assumption but we are continuing to see continued deflation in the upstream as we go forward peter low redburn analyst very clear thank you craig marshall group head of investor relations peter thank you we ll take the next question from henry tarr at berenberg henry henry tarr berenberg analyst hi thanks for taking my question and just a couple so one back on the refining environment i think you talked about the improving of the underlying environment hopefully through the rest of this year what would you need to see for that to come through i guess imo is not yet played out as somewhat i thought and it looks to be kind of too much capacity currently in both pet chems and refining so how confident are you that we ll see an improvement there over the coming quarters and then just secondly on divestments given the challenging environment and how easy how it been to strike deals and i guess you ve got the further 5 billion as we look into 2021 are there any sort of areas specifically where you re looking where you think there is interest around divestments thanks brian gilvary chief financial officer so let me pick up the divestments first because a big chunk of it was the purchase of bpx is bhp assets and the selling off of bpx is all dry gas the difficult assets to sell has been the lower 48 gas assets were pretty much now done with those and there s been less issues in selling the balance of midstream downstream upstream assets certainly upstream in terms of oil linked as you ve seen in the north sea in the fourth quarter so less of an issue with those we ve now done 9 4 of the 10 is announced the balance will come very shortly and then we ve got another 5 billion package the 5 billion package is going to be a mix of upstream downstream midstream so it s across the piece and there ll be some portfolio options in terms of less price sensitive things that we can do inside that 5 billion so very confident and i think look our m a team i think their track record now must be somewhere up to 75 billion to 80 billion if not 85 billion of disposals over the last decade so we have a pretty hot very well tuned machine and it s been particularly well tuned through 2019 as it had to deal with some of the private equity that we had to deal with in terms of lower 48 gas that won t be an issue i believe going forward in terms of refining margins actually we are starting to see more pulp kick in i mean it s now active this year takes effect march 1st it came into enactment this year people after all had to do deal with scrubbers use 0 5 sulfur or switch to lng in terms of its use but i think that will underpin margins this year and we re seeing that you re going to have to start to see some of these stocks clear out one of the things particularly you need to be paid of course is the light heavy spread and we will see the benefits of that effort whiting where it s up over 20 a barrel and i think it average somewhere close to 12 a barrel last year or certainly below 12 a barrel so i think that will from our position is a bp s position in terms of light heavy will help but you re right there are some stocks to clear out before we start to see that recovery but marpol definitely in terms of distillate is underpinning the market right now bob dudley group chief executive i think i would add as a footnote as we look at the scheduled turnarounds around the world and where our refineries are we have very few coming up and others do so we ll have a it looks like a pretty straight through period of uptime brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah that s actually but that s really important point 2q is going to be a high turnaround quarter i think for the industry we ve done most of ours in the last two years so we will have a relatively low turnaround year this year henry tarr berenberg analyst great thanks and i wish you both the best of the future craig marshall group head of investor relations thank you henry okay we ll take the next question from jason gammel at jefferies jason jason gammel jefferies llc analyst thank you craig and bob may i just add my best wishes to you for all your future endeavors bob you ve taken over essentially leadership on bp s strategy for the energy transition and i was hoping you can just leave us with some thoughts on what you think bp needs to do to be successful in the energy transition and maybe even any high level milestones that we should be looking for out of bp and then my second question is on the divestiture the incremental divestitures that were announced today just give us some details on that and i know you don t want to identify specific assets but does carbon intensity of the assets play a large role in your decision on whether to put them up for sale or not really kind of thinking particular canadian oil sands brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah i ll just pick up the second part of that question to say that value of volume is what determines everything we do in strategy we already deploy a carbon price across our whole portfolio when we look at investments that s taken into account it s 40 a ton and we stress test up to 80 a ton so in some respects that s already built into our valuation as we think the carrying value of these assets going forward so i think i won t specifically point to any asset which you wouldn t expect me to but it is very much driven by strategy and think about value over volume in terms of portfolio going forward bob dudley group chief executive yes jason thank you very much for your remarks and thanks for some you say in the paper it is gratifying i think the thing as we go forward we have completely reestablished what we re doing in the low carbon world lightsource bp as a business model is quite unique and different that i think has clearly grown and been successful and it attracts a lot of capital that we might not see coming into oil and gas projects and i don t think we get the credit for that it s going to continue to grow i think bp bunge is another one it s the business models that are different i think in some of the low carbon in new alternative energies that i think you ll see have done and i think you will see us continue to do those so they might require a little bit different way of evaluating them for you as you model things i think the combinations of our business is the integration of our business it will be something that i think you will have to work with us on how we model those going forward i think the returns are important but many businesses go through phases and they change their business character over time and so it s getting the right pace of doing that going forward mobility is remarkably changing your electrification of car fleets and of course there is going to be a huge amount of liquid fuels used in heavy vehicles and automobiles and air transport but mobility electric mobility is certainly coming to a city near you i think the combination of what we re doing with ultra fast charging and the liquid fuels in the convenience marketing is a key here and i think you ve heard doesn t like me to say it we actually make more money off of a cup of coffee in london than we do a tank of fuel in terms of margin so it s how we are using our assets differently in our real estate but i think is going to be part of this future as well partnerships will form some new ones some interesting ones you ve seen us talk about the creation and the goal of five unicorns and we think we have some of the technologies that can be able to do that not necessarily in low carbon but just our capabilities in terms of many things like acoustics going forward i think you may see us move into we re very intrigued with offshore wind for example we obviously think we have offshore capability to get involved with that you ll probably see that we didn t for many years quite frankly because the gearboxes were in the salt zones and now they are building in the size of the eiffel tower and the rather that salt and i think there is a lot of different things in some of the other companies are doing it as well that you ll see us pursue stay tuned jason craig marshall group head of investor relations thank you jason okay we re going to take the penultimate question from pavel molchanov from raymond james pavel pavel molchanov raymond james associates analyst thanks for taking the questions first in relation to the esg topic several of your european peers are starting to include scope 3 emissions in their internal targets you have not historically wanted to do that i m curious if you might be rethinking that stance and then secondly as it relates to reserve bookings you mentioned the small number of project fids in 2019 as the reason for sub 100 replacement should we anticipate a revival of fids this year as then means of getting a replacement back above 100 bob dudley group chief executive well i ll make a comment pavel on scope 3 emissions we do report scope 3 emissions admit that we don t but we do but scope 3 emissions is become a real short hand thing when actually you would look into it and you look at the 6 european oil companies everyone defines it differently so i think as a starting point it would help if we all got a common definition on that but we will define and get clear how we measure it and i would expect that but it s too short hand it has been at least for me it s too short hand because it just mean so many different things to different people brian would you add to that and i ll come back brian gilvary chief financial officer yeah i mean just to that point i mean probably there were 15 i can tell you this the chairman of the 100 group of 100 directors in the uk there are 15 separate definitions within scope 3 that you could look at around scope 3 emissions we ve looked at it exhaustively over the last couple of years and there is not consistency across sectors and there s not consistency within sector so i think we do need to get consistency on the merger going forward but i think it will be premature to talk about what we will now do in the next phase ahead of burn its ambition that will lay out for the company next week so i think there will be more to follow around the specifics of that on 12th of february so i think we can if you re happy to leave until then we will come back to it then bob dudley group chief executive and then on pavel reserve replacement ratios we really have the five fids in 2019 in the gulf of mexico atlantis seagull azerbaijan the central east projects thunderhead south and our kg fields in india and as we go forward we see the ones the four or five in 2020 and 7 or 8 in 21 it s never a smooth line with reserve replacement ratios they kind of move up and down it s not something we re really emphasizing value over volume so we don t really know whether it will be and i don t look at 67 or 70 as a big drop because we have been measuring about 100 over the last five years not sure but again it s value over the volume craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you pavel and we will take the final question from bertrand hodee thanks for being patient bertrand bertrand hodee kepler cheuvreux analyst thanks for taking my question and congratulation bob and brian for all the good work and strong achievement at bp i have two small question left one on project delivery so brian i appreciate you to comment on the egypt raven delays can you give us an update on tangguh train 3 and phase ii export when can we expect those to start up and the second question is related to the impact of divestment in your 2020 production so brian you mentioned 250 000 barrels per day of negative impact from divestment can you give us a share of us gas inside that number bob dudley group chief executive so yes in terms of projects tangguh expansion is on track i think first production is something like 2021 so we ll come back to that at the end of this year in terms of how that looks i don t have the other figures to hand in terms of but as far as i know everything on the project side is on track vis a vis what we laid out last year and then sorry bert on your second question bertrand hodee kepler cheuvreux analyst so the second question was around the divestment impact on your upstream production in 2020 you mentioned 250 000 barrels per day of negative impact from divestments expected in 2020 i was wondering how much of inside that relates to us lower 48 onshore natural gas bob dudley group chief executive yeah sorry so the bulk of it will be natural gas equivalent there is some assets that we sold off in the north sea in terms of oil production but the bulk of it will below 48 gas of course that would be a negative cash right now given where we see henry hub gas prices so it doesn t really have an impact from a cash perspective bertrand hodee kepler cheuvreux analyst okay thank you bob dudley group chief executive very good thank you bertrand and bertrand we will follow up with you after the call on the project specifically around those but i don t think there are any issues around it craig marshall group head of investor relations okay thank you everybody for the questions that s the end of the q a i m now going to hand over to bob but just before i do on a personal note bob it s been an absolute privilege to work for you and i know i speak on behalf of investor relations when i say that and i m sure that s echoed from the investment community so thank you very much bob dudley group chief executive well thank you craig and thank all of you on the call who brian and i work with so closely over the really many years here i think rather than reflecting on the things that i often do at the end of the call which is about safety people and bp s culture and the strong portfolio of relationships they are going to remain central to this company going forward bp i think has an enormously talented motivated workforce and it s what they do that makes bp a great company in my view and as for you all our investors and our analysts i think one of the cornerstones of our strategy has been this sort of steadfast focus on growing shareholder value with capital discipline and admittedly it took us a while to get on that track but set against this backdrop of all the challenges and the volatility we ve done i think it s i think it s been good i think we re delivering that investor proposition that many of you have challenges on over the years i met a great number of you all around the world and quite frankly i never failed to be impressed with your interest in the company and the industry your knowledge the

gaap measures this press release includes the non gaap financial measures entitled adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share adjusted operating income loss per share is derived from adjusted operating income loss the chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income loss the company defines adjusted operating income loss as income loss from continuing operations excluding the after tax effects of income loss from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests net investment gains losses goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt gains losses on insurance block transactions restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non operating items gains losses on insurance block transactions are defined as gains losses on the early extinguishment of non recourse funding obligations early termination fees for other financing restructuring and or resulting gains losses on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business the company excludes net investment gains losses and infrequent or unusual non operating items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the company s segments and corporate and other activities a component of the company s net investment gains losses is the result of impairments the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles in addition the size and timing of other investment gains losses can be subject to the company s discretion and are influenced by market opportunities as well as asset liability matching considerations goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt gains losses on insurance block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss

opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends while some of these items may be significant components of net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders in accordance with u s gaap the company believes that adjusted operating income loss and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income loss including adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income loss attributable to the ongoing operations of the business management also uses adjusted operating income loss as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts however the items excluded from adjusted operating income loss have occurred in the past and could and in some cases will recur in the future adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders or net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of adjusted operating income loss may differ from the definitions used by other companies in 2019 the company revised how it taxes the adjustments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders to adjusted operating income loss to align the tax rate used in the reconciliation to each segment s local jurisdictional tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2019 the company used a tax rate of 30 percent for its australia mortgage insurance segment to tax effect its adjustments its domestic segments remain at a 21 percent tax rate in 2018 the company assumed a flat 21 percent tax rate on adjustments for all of its segments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders and adjusted operating income loss these adjustments are also net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests and net investment gains losses are adjusted for dac and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves prior year amounts have not been re presented to reflect this revised presentation however the previous methodology would not have resulted in a materially different segment level adjusted operating income loss the company recorded a pre tax expense of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to restructuring costs as it continues to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses there were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from adjusted operating income loss during the periods presented other than fees incurred during the fourth quarter

financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and its domestic businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent the company s segment tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pre tax income loss of each segment which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between u s gaap and local tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance products the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of the company s revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force insurance in force for the company s mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date risk in force for the company s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance risk in force in the australia mortgage insurance business is computed using an effective risk in force amount which recognizes that the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor of 35 percent that represents the highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of the company s mortgage insurance business in australia the company also has certain risk share arrangements in australia where it provides pro rata coverage of certain loans rather than 100 percent coverage as a result for loans with these risk share arrangements the applicable pro rata coverage amount provided is used when applying the factor the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the

gaap measures this press release includes the non gaap financial measures entitled adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share adjusted operating income loss per share is derived from adjusted operating income loss the chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources on the basis of adjusted operating income loss the company defines adjusted operating income loss as income loss from continuing operations excluding the after tax effects of income loss from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests net investment gains losses goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt gains losses on insurance block transactions restructuring costs and infrequent or unusual non operating items gains losses on insurance block transactions are defined as gains losses on the early extinguishment of non recourse funding obligations early termination fees for other financing restructuring and or resulting gains losses on reinsurance restructuring for certain blocks of business the company excludes net investment gains losses and infrequent or unusual non operating items because the company does not consider them to be related to the operating performance of the company s segments and corporate and other activities a component of the company s net investment gains losses is the result of impairments the size and timing of which can vary significantly depending on market credit cycles in addition the size and timing of other investment gains losses can be subject to the company s discretion and are influenced by market opportunities as well as asset liability matching considerations goodwill impairments gains losses on the sale of businesses gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt gains losses on insurance block transactions and restructuring costs are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss because in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends infrequent or unusual non operating items are also excluded from adjusted operating income loss if in the company s opinion they are not indicative of overall operating trends while some of these items may be significant components of net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders in accordance with u s gaap the company believes that adjusted operating income loss and measures that are derived from or incorporate adjusted operating income loss including adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are appropriate measures that are useful to investors because they identify the income loss attributable to the ongoing operations of the business management also uses adjusted operating income loss as a basis for determining awards and compensation for senior management and to evaluate performance on a basis comparable to that used by analysts however the items excluded from adjusted operating income loss have occurred in the past and could and in some cases will recur in the future adjusted operating income loss and adjusted operating income loss per share on a basic and diluted basis are not substitutes for net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders or net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders per share on a basic and diluted basis determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of adjusted operating income loss may differ from the definitions used by other companies in 2019 the company revised how it taxes the adjustments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders to adjusted operating income loss to align the tax rate used in the reconciliation to each segment s local jurisdictional tax rate beginning in the first quarter of 2019 the company used a tax rate of 30 percent for its australia mortgage insurance segment to tax effect its adjustments its domestic segments remain at a 21 percent tax rate in 2018 the company assumed a flat 21 percent tax rate on adjustments for all of its segments to reconcile net income loss available to genworth financial inc s common stockholders and adjusted operating income loss these adjustments are also net of the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests and net investment gains losses are adjusted for dac and other intangible amortization and certain benefit reserves prior year amounts have not been re presented to reflect this revised presentation however the previous methodology would not have resulted in a materially different segment level adjusted operating income loss the company recorded a pre tax expense of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 and 2 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to restructuring costs as it continues to evaluate and appropriately size its organizational needs and expenses there were no infrequent or unusual items excluded from adjusted operating income loss during the periods presented other than fees incurred during the fourth quarter

months ended september 30 2019 and reflect adjusted operating income loss as determined in accordance with accounting guidance related to segment reporting this press release includes the non gaap financial measure entitled core yield as a measure of investment yield the company defines core yield as the investment yield adjusted for items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the investment portfolio management believes that analysis of core yield enhances understanding of the investment yield of the company however core yield is not a substitute for investment yield determined in accordance with u s gaap in addition the company s definition of core yield may differ from the definitions used by other companies a reconciliation of reported u s gaap yield to core yield is included in a table at the end of this press release definition of selected operating performance measures the company taxes its international businesses at their local jurisdictional tax rates and its domestic businesses at the u s corporate federal income tax rate of 21 percent the company s segment tax methodology applies the respective jurisdictional or domestic tax rate to the pre tax income loss of each segment which is then adjusted in each segment to reflect the tax attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign withholding taxes and permanent differences between u s gaap and local tax law the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the annually determined tax rates and adjustments to each segment s provision for income taxes are estimates which are subject to review and could change from year to year the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written for mortgage insurance products the company considers new insurance written to be a measure of the company s operating performance because it represents a measure of new sales of insurance policies during a specified period rather than a measure of the company s revenues or profitability during that period management regularly monitors and reports insurance in force and risk in force insurance in force for the company s mortgage insurance businesses is a measure of the aggregate original loan balance for outstanding insurance policies as of the respective reporting date risk in force for the company s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance risk in force in the australia mortgage insurance business is computed using an effective risk in force amount which recognizes that the loss on any particular loan will be reduced by the net proceeds received upon sale of the property effective risk in force has been calculated by applying to insurance in force a factor of 35 percent that represents the highest expected average per claim payment for any one underwriting year over the life of the company s mortgage insurance business in australia the company also has certain risk share arrangements in australia where it provides pro rata coverage of certain loans rather than 100 percent coverage as a result for loans with these risk share arrangements the applicable pro rata coverage amount provided is used when applying the factor the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums for the long term care insurance business the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in reserves less tabular interest on reserves less loss adjustment expenses to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance the

profitability related to policies or contracts sold in prior periods or from investments or other sources cautionary note regarding forward looking statements this press release contains certain

0 as reported net cruise costs ncc excluding fuel per apcd were up 11 4 in constant currency up 10 8 as reported full year 2020 guidance wave season has started on a very robust basis with strong demand especially in the us and european markets as previously announced the wuhan coronavirus and the efforts to contain it are expected to negatively affect our results while we expect this to be temporary the situation is highly fluid and the overall impact cannot reasonably be estimated at this time accordingly our guidance does not include any provision for the impact of the outbreak we will update our guidance as the situation stabilizes and we can reasonably estimate its impact net yields are expected to increase 2 25 to 4 25 in constant currency and 2 5 to 4 5 as reported ncc excluding fuel per apcd are expected to increase 1 75 to 2 25 in both constant currency and as reported basis adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of 10 40 to 10 70 per share 20 25 by

it will also focus on further improving our guest satisfaction and employee engagement while continuing to deliver strong returns on invested capital we are pairing ambitious business and environmental goals because we all understand that businesses must do our part to meet the needs of all our stakeholders said richard d fain chairman and ceo over the last years our people have worked hard to deliver strong performance on both profitability metrics and important societal goals this 20 25 by 2025 program should help take those efforts to the next level full year 2019 results us gaap net income for the year was 1 9 billion or 8 95 per share and adjusted net income was 2 0 billion or 9 54 per share this result was achieved despite a series of extraordinary events including the dry dock incident in the grand bahama shipyard the cancellation of the cruises to cuba and an unusual hurricane season all of which negatively impacted the company s results for the year net yields were up 8 0 in constant currency the consolidation of silversea s operations the new cruise terminal in miami the perfect day development new hardware and strong demand for our core products drove the year over year increase ncc excluding fuel per apcd were up 11 4 in constant currency the main drivers behind the year over year increase were the consolidation of silversea s operations the new cruise terminal in miami investments in our private destinations and technology and more drydock days fourth quarter 2019 results us gaap net income for the fourth quarter was 273 1 million or 1 30 per share and adjusted net income was 297 4 million or 1 42 per share last year us gaap net income was 315 7 million or 1 50 per share and adjusted net income was 322 1 million or 1 53 per share the negative impact of the cancellation of the sailings to cuba and the disruption generated by hurricane dorian were the main drivers of the decline in the year over year results during the quarter gross yields were up 6 2 in constant currency net yields were up 6 8 in constant currency within guidance gross cruise costs per apcd increased 9 6 in constant currency ncc excluding fuel per apcd were up 15 9 in constant currency higher than guidance driven by marine costs and employee related expenses additionally lower depreciation expenses and a higher contribution from our joint ventures positively impacted the quarter s performance vs guidance bunker pricing net of hedging for the fourth quarter was 468 4 per metric ton and consumption was 380 400 metric tons full year 2020 guidance the company is very encouraged about the demand environment for 2020 wave season has started on a strong note with overall rates higher than same time last year and booked load factors ahead of same time last year on a like for like basis the company s new ships and new attractions are a major driver not only of revenue but of the strength of its brands demand for the core products is very strong across all quarters recent geopolitical events such as the brushfires in australia and unrest in the middle east have impacted demand for certain itineraries but the strength of the core products has more than compensated the company expects a net yield increase in the range of 2 25 to 4 25 in constant currency and 2 5 to 4 5 as reported for the full year the company is very excited about the introduction of four new ships during 2020 these new ships will be important contributors to the yield growth and profitability the timing of the new ship deliveries will result in a more significant yield growth in the second half of the year than in the first half our yield outlook for 2020 is very encouraging with higher pricing on top of an exceptional 2019 performance said jason t liberty executive vice president and cfo it s clear that the coronavirus will impact revenue in china in the short term but we are a long term business and our plans to continue growing this profitable market remain unchanged we are also very excited about the introduction of our 20 25 by 2025 goals our formula for success is simple and our path towards our eps goal is driven by moderately growing our yields effectively managing our costs and moderately growing our business meanwhile our emissions target which is one of our many sustainability initiatives will further focus our world class design engineering and operations teams to meaningfully improve our environmental impact ncc excluding fuel are expected to be up 1 75 to 2 25 in both constant currency and as reported basis operating costs for the full year show continued good discipline although the cadence of costs between quarters will vary costs in the first half of the year are expected to be higher than the second half driven by more drydock days and the timing of ship deliveries excluding any impact from the coronavirus and taking into account current fuel pricing interest rates currency exchange rates and the factors detailed above the company estimates 2020 adjusted eps will be in the range of 10 40 to 10 70 per share coronavirus update we have now cancelled 8 cruises out of china ending march 4th and also modified certain itineraries in the region which overall have an estimated impact of 0 25 per share the company has also implemented several measures to protect guests and crew regardless of nationality the company will deny boarding to any individual who has travelled from to or through mainland china or hong kong in the past 15 days these guests will receive full refunds there will be mandatory specialized health screenings performed on guests who have been in contact with individuals who have traveled from to or through mainland china or hong kong in the past 15 days all holders of china or hong kong passports regardless of when they were last in china or hong kong guests who report feeling unwell or demonstrate flu like symptoms these standards also apply to all employees crew members and contractors of rcl the company is assessing developments constantly and will update these measures as needed there are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding this outbreak to calculate the impact on the business for example we expect that an erosion of consumer confidence in china could have an additional impact on load factor and rate until the market normalizes if these travel restrictions and concerns over the outbreak continue for an extended period of time they could have a material impact on the overall financial performance of the company first quarter 2020 guidance net yields are expected to be down approximately 0 5 in constant currency and down 0 5 to 1 0 as reported demand for the core products and onboard experiences is very strong nevertheless the unprecedented bushfires in australia and recent activity in hong kong and the middle east are each having a negative impact in the first quarter moreover the first quarter is also being negatively impacted by other structural elements such as the discontinuation of cuba sailings which equals a revenue headwind of approximately 120 basis points and a tough year over year comparable as we are lapping the inaugural seasons of two new ships during the first quarter of 2019 ncc excluding fuel per apcd for the quarter are expected to increase approximately 3 0 in both constant currency and as reported basis based on current fuel pricing interest rates currency exchange rates and the factors detailed above the company expects first quarter adjusted eps to be in the range of 0 80 to 0 85 per share fuel expense and summary of key guidance stats fuel expense the company does not forecast fuel prices and its fuel cost calculations are based on current at the pump prices net of hedging impacts based on today s fuel prices the company has included 191 million and 744 million of fuel expense in its first quarter and full year 2020 guidance respectively forecasted

communicate and motivate employees to work towards company specific goals the program includes several goals by 2025 delivering 20 00 adjusted earnings per share further reducing the company s carbon footprint by 25 against a 2019 base delivering strong returns on invested capital and continuing to improve on record guest satisfaction and employee engagement metrics adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps represents adjusted net income attributable to royal caribbean cruises ltd divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding as applicable we believe that this non gaap measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis adjusted net income adjusted net income represents net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis for the periods presented these items included i costs net of insurance recoveries related to the grand bahama drydock structure incident involving oasis of the seas ii our equity share of the write off of the grand bahama drydock and other incidental expenses by grand bahama iii the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by heritage cruise holding ltd s previously known as silversea cruises group ltd noncontrolling interest iv the change in fair value in the contingent consideration related to the silversea cruises acquisition v a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of certain loans vi the amortization of the silversea cruises intangible assets resulting from the acquisition vii integration costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition viii transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition ix restructuring charges incurred in relation to the reorganization of our international sales and

impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards available passenger cruise days apcd apcd is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days we use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary carbon footprint for purposes of the 20 25 by 2025 program the company s carbon footprint is measured as carbon intensity in kilograms of co2e carbon dioxide equivalent at double occupancy per cabin multiplied by distance in kilometers sailed for consistent tracking over time the base year metric may need to be recalculated if the company undergoes significant structural changes such as acquisitions divestments and mergers in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol constant currency we believe net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel are our most relevant non gaap financial measures however a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar because our reporting currency is the us dollar the value of these revenues and expenses in us dollars will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses it can be an important element for this reason we also monitor net yields net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel in constant currency i e as if the current period s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period s rates we calculate constant currency by applying the average prior year period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and or forecasted period so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods we do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods it should be emphasized that the use of constant currency is primarily used by us for comparing short term changes and or projections over the longer term changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency based fluctuations double double our double double program refers to the multi year program completed in 2017 that was designed to help us better communicate and motivate our employees about our business goals by articulating longer term financial objectives under the program we targeted adjusted eps of 6 78 in 2017 double our 2014 adjusted eps of 3 39 and roic of 10 in 2017 compared to roic of 5 9 in 2014 gross cruise costs gross cruise costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing selling and administrative expenses for the periods presented gross cruise costs exclude i restructuring charges incurred in relation to the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure and other initiative expenses ii transaction costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition iii integration costs related to the silversea cruises acquisition iv the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business and v the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight line attribution method for time based stock awards which were included within marketing selling and administrative expenses gross yields gross yields represent total revenues per apcd net cruise costs ncc and ncc excluding fuel net cruise costs represent gross cruise costs excluding commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and in the case of net cruise costs excluding fuel fuel expenses in measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income we believe changes in net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance net cruise costs and net cruise costs excluding fuel exclude the costs net of insurance recoveries related to the grand bahama drydock structure incident involving oasis of the seas net revenues net revenues represent total revenues less commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses net yields net yields represent net revenues per apcd we utilize net revenues and net yields to manage our business on a day to day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs which are commissions transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses occupancy occupancy in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice is calculated by dividing passenger cruise days by apcd a percentage in excess of 100 indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins passenger cruise days passenger cruise days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises for additional information see adjusted measures of financial performance below royal caribbean cruises ltd nyse rcl

article socialist equality group the right wing record of jacinda arderns government in new zealand by the socialist equality group new zealand 3 february 2020 original url new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern announced on january 28 that the next election the right wing record of jacinda ardern s government in new zealand by the socialist equality group new zealand 3 february 2020 original url new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern announced on january 28 that the next election will be held on september 19 marking the beginning of an eight month campaign since the labour new zealand first greens coalition government was formed just over two years ago it has received significant positive coverage in the world s corporate media new zealand under ardern has been depicted in the new york times the british guardian and elsewhere as an oasis of kindness and egalitarianism in contrast to right wing governments led by trump in the us boris johnson in britain and scott morrison in australia ardern has appeared twice on time s yearly list of the world s 100 most influential people first for having a baby while in office and second for her response to the christchurch massacre her supposedly groundbreaking achievements have been hailed by british labour leader jeremy corbyn and us democrat alexandria ocasio cortez to name just two of many politicians around the world this international praise is aimed at fostering illusions that with leaders like ardern in charge capitalism can be saved and its evils curbed the ruling classes are watching with fear as millions of workers and young people internationally join mass strikes and protests against record levels of social inequality environmental destruction and attacks on democratic rights governments are seeking to combat rising support for socialism particularly among young people announcing the election date ardern declared that the labour party would run a positive factual and robust election campaign highlighting the government s supposed progress on the long term challenges facing new zealand these included she said making critical investments in health and education and reducing child poverty none of this rhetoric has any relationship to reality she was installed as labour leader just two months before the september 2017 election in a desperate bid to prevent the party s collapse labour had suffered historic defeats in 2011 and 2014 and broad sections of the working class correctly view it as a party of big business indistinguishable from the conservative national party after the election labour did not have enough support to govern alone it won 36 9 percent of the votes compared with national s 44 4 percent ardern only became prime minister following a month of sordid negotiations with the right wing nationalist and anti immigrant nz first party which received just 7 2 percent of the votes the unpopular nz first determined the makeup of the government it chose a coalition government with labour instead of the national party because it viewed labour as its preferred partner to whip up xenophobia and integrate new zealand more closely into washington s military confrontation with china labour had campaigned for years in a de facto alliance with nz first and joined its demonisation of chinese immigrants scapegoating them for the housing affordability crisis nz first leader winston peters who became deputy prime minister and foreign minister declared that his coalition with ardern would restore capitalism with a human face ardern echoed this message promising to address poverty homelessness and end nine years of vicious austerity imposed by the national party government after the 2008 financial crisis this propaganda has been exposed by the reality of the past two years the ardern government has overseen increased poverty housing insecurity and starved public services of funding and resources it has attacked democratic rights strengthened the police demonised immigrants and intensified preparations for war the necessary conclusion to be drawn is that capitalism cannot be reformed but must be overthrown labour and the rest of the political establishment are incapable of offering any solution to the dangers of war the climate crisis and the rapidly worsening living conditions the failure of capitalism is leading to revolutionary struggles workers and youth must consciously prepare by building the socialist and internationalist leadership required to unify and lead these struggles imperialist warmongering against china the socialist equality group seg warned from the outset that labour s decision to give the anti immigrant nz first party a central role in government including the roles of foreign minister and defence minister signalled a further rightward shift aimed at aligning new zealand more firmly with us preparations for war against china a key factor in the formation of the government was the unprecedented intervention of us ambassador scott brown who publicly criticised the national party s reluctance to fully endorse trump s criminal threat to totally destroy north korea brown signalled that the us wanted the next government to take a much tougher anti chinese stance just days before the election pro us academic anne marie brady with the support of much of the media and nz first launched a witch hunt against chinese influence within the national party which she implied was compromised by close business ties with china in 2018 the labour led government explicitly named china and russia as the main threats to the international order echoing washington ardern has kept nz troops in iraq and afghanistan assisting the criminal us occupation of those countries in return peters has repeatedly called on the us to deploy more military forces to the pacific region to push back against chinese diplomacy and economic influence and help new zealand enforce its own neo colonial domination over tonga samoa and other small impoverished island nations while starving crucial social services such as health and education of funds the government is committed to spending 20 billion on military assets by 2030 and expanding the size of the army from 4 500 to 6 000 troops new zealand hosts regular military exercises with us and australian troops that are explicitly aimed at preparing to invade pacific countries and suppress popular uprisings encouraged by the government brady and other pro us commentators are engaged in a vicious anti chinese witch hunt demanding state surveillance of chinese born immigrants including members of parliament journalists student associations and community groups brady has also called for stripping voting rights from recent immigrants and reducing economic ties with china nz s main trading partner a major participant in this xenophobic campaign is the pro government trade union funded daily blog which frequently rails against our chinese overlords and paints chinese immigrants as a threat to social stability the same rhetoric is being used by openly fascistic and extreme right wing groups the christchurch massacre and the promotion of the extreme right as in the 1930s the ruling classes in every country are whipping up nationalism and encouraging outright fascist forces to prepare for war divide the working class and pre empt the emergence of a socialist movement the horrific march 15 attack on two mosques in christchurch by fascist terrorist brenton tarrant who killed 51 people and injured 50 more shattered the perception that new zealand was isolated from the growth of extreme right tendencies internationally fascist networks aim to prove that such an atrocity can happen anywhere in the world the seg rejected attempts by politicians and media commentators to paint tarrant as an outsider whose actions reflected nothing about new zealand society because he was born in australia in fact his fascist manifesto contained racist and anti muslim language reminiscent of nz first including an obsession with the low birth rates and the replacement of the white population tarrant blamed immigrants for poor wages and conditions in words similar to those used by the labour party and the trade union bureaucracy the media glorification of ardern s response to the christchurch attack was aimed at preventing any discussion of these glaring similarities likewise the state censorship of tarrant s manifesto is intended to disarm the working class by obscuring the connection between the terrorist s fascist ideology and the right wing nationalism advocated by the political establishment the seg denounced the suppression of the document as a serious attack on democratic rights the circumstances of the attack remain shrouded in secrecy with the official royal commission of inquiry taking place behind closed doors it is clear however that tarrant was part of a network of fascists that enjoyed protection from the australian and new zealand police who turned a blind eye to warnings about tarrant s violent threats against immigrants and communists no explanation has been given for the failure of new zealand s intelligence agencies to stop the attack despite being extremely well resourced to carry out mass surveillance as part of the us led five eyes spying network the massacre was seized upon as a pretext to further boost the resources of the spy agencies and introduce new armed police units in south auckland waikato and canterbury draconian new anti terror legislation will allow police to label someone a terrorist without any need to prove them guilty of a crime and subject them to surveillance and other attacks on basic democratic rights ardern has also become the international poster woman for internet censorship ostensibly to stop the spread of violent extremist and terrorist content what constitutes extremism will be decided by the state in collaboration with internet and social media conglomerates already facebook google youtube and twitter have drastically changed their algorithms to censor anti war left wing and socialist websites including the world socialist web site by directing traffic to the authoritative corporate media at the same time governments in europe the us australia and asia are all creating laws that criminalise left wing protests against inequality climate change and in defence of immigrants escalating social inequality the main target of the government s anti democratic measures and xenophobic propaganda is the working class which is attempting to fight back against decades of attacks on living standards the 2017 election triggered a groundswell of demands that the ardern government fulfil its promise to end austerity teachers nurses and other healthcare workers called for significant wage increases and an end to the under staffing and under resourcing of schools and hospitals this year will see a further intensification of the class struggle at the labour party s 2019 conference in november ardern voiced concern about mass anti austerity protests erupting in chile and elsewhere in this increasingly fractured world she said i m reminded of the impact of inequality on not just our people but also on the strength of our democracy as the country heads towards another election she said the government would create further opportunities to lift people up and make a difference to people s lives but ardern s pledges since 2017 to create a society where we look after the most vulnerable where we support our families where we make sure people have the most basic of needs like a roof over their head were always a fraud the seg explained that labour s promises were fundamentally incompatible with its refusal to increase taxes on the rich the labour greens pact to keep government spending below 30 percent of gross domestic product the same as the national party government and pledges to pour billions into the police and military moreover we insisted that labour had to be judged not on ardern s false promises but on its record as one of new zealand s two main parties of big business and imperialism like social democratic parties internationally labour long ago severed any connection with the program of social reformism by the 1970s the unprecedented globalisation of production had removed any basis for containing the class struggle through concessions to workers based on the nationally protected economy the 1984 1990 labour government of david lange launched an assault on the working class every bit as ruthless as the pro business restructuring under thatcher in britain and reagan in the us labour sold off state owned industries including telecommunications and steel and prepared the forestry and rail industries for privatisation with tens of thousands of layoffs it halved the top tax rate for the rich from 66 percent to 33 percent while introducing the regressive goods and services tax gst fees were introduced for tertiary education and some healthcare services in the name of boosting global competitiveness tariffs and subsidies were removed from uncompetitive sections of the economy leading to the complete shutdown of the auto industry and a wave of factory closures mass redundancies and wage cuts in industries such as meat processing approximately 76 000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992 alone the trade unions played a critical role in suppressing any fightback by the working class the 1990 1999 national party government deepened this pro business agenda with major cuts to welfare attacks on workers rights and more privatisations none of the attacks were reversed under prime minister helen clark s labour government from 1999 2008 which was supported by the pseudo left alliance party and the greens clark cemented new zealand s ties with us imperialism by sending troops to afghanistan and iraq at the same time labour tightly restricted spending on social programs leading to greater poverty household debt and inequality student debt soared as universities hiked fees labour lost power after the onset of a recession in 2008 followed by the global financial crash which sparked a wave of job cuts and government austerity enforced by the unions the 2008 2017 government of national party prime minister john key continued the onslaught it froze public spending including wages for teachers and healthcare workers slashed jobs raised the gst partially privatised power companies and attacked welfare entitlements for single parents in opposition labour backed austerity declaring that any government would have had to cut back in response to the crisis the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen under ardern the super rich have reaped massive profits thanks to low corporate taxes low wages and tax free gains in the property market the 2019 national business review rich list shows the country s richest people have a combined 90 billion in total wealth up from 81 billion in 2018 the richest 10 percent controls 53 percent of the wealth and the top 1 percent holds 19 percent meanwhile 17 percent of children live in households below the official poverty line of half the median income up from 16 percent when labour came to power after housing costs are accounted for nearly a quarter of all children live in poverty there is an explosion of poverty related social problems including a rise in diseases caused by poor quality and overcrowded housing and an epidemic of methamphetamine use suicides reached an all time high in 2018 19 of 685 a staggering 21 percent increase in just four years the soaring cost of housing has pushed household debt to a record 164 4 percent of gross income up from 100 percent 20 years ago median rents increased 12 5 percent since october 2017 about three times the rate of wage increases median house prices increased 8 6 percent in the past year alone and auckland is among the least affordable cities in the world with house prices nine times the median income up from 5 4 in 2004 the ardern government has failed to address the crisis an increase of about 3 400 public housing units since october 2017 has been far outstripped by demand the number of families waiting for public housing has increased from 5 844 to 14 500 more than one in 100 people are homeless the return of the class struggle under considerable pressure from workers trade unions that had for decades suppressed any opposition to government cuts were forced to call nationwide strikes in 2018 and 2019 this movement was part of an international upsurge of the working class that includes the yellow vest protests in france the auto workers strike in the us the strike by factory workers in matamoros mexico and mass protests in puerto rico algeria sudan chile egypt lebanon and other countries healthcare workers and teachers have been at the forefront of struggles because they confront every day the consequences of entrenched poverty and the destruction of essential services the trade union bureaucracy however has systematically isolated workers worn them down and betrayed them the unions ceased decades ago to be workers organisations in any meaningful sense they consist of a privileged layer of officials wedded to the labour party whose role is to police workers and enforce the dictates of big business in the name of national competitiveness the new zealand nurses organisation nzno held a one day strike in 2018 the first by public hospital workers since 1989 the union however echoed labour s lie that there was no money to properly staff and resource hospitals after decades in which health funding has failed to keep pace with inflation and population growth the nzno pressured workers to accept a paltry pay increase that was below the increased cost of living which then became the benchmark for an effective wage freeze throughout the public sector following a strike in may by more than 50 000 primary and secondary teachers the largest strike the country has ever seen the post primary teachers association and the new zealand educational institute forced through a deal similar to nzno s in both disputes the unions agreed to the government s cap on wage increases at 3 percent per year instead of the 15 to 18 percent demanded by workers and no significant measures to address the staffing crisis these rotten deals have led to growing anger and frustration more explosive struggles are inevitable and workers will come into ever more open conflict not only with the labour government but with the union bureaucracy the socialist equality group seg intervened in these struggles publishing dozens of articles and statements which were widely read and holding meetings with workers the seg called on workers to reject the union backed austerity and fight for socialist policies including the demand for tens of billions of dollars for schools and hospitals funded through a major redistribution of wealth from the rich and an end to military spending to carry out such a fight requires a political break from the labour party and all its allies and a rebellion against the pro capitalist union bureaucracies workers must take matters into their own hands through the formation of rank and file workplace committees such organisations democratically controlled by workers will unite workers within new zealand and internationally and carry out a real struggle against the labour government and its austerity agenda the pseudo lefts perspective in tatters the seg s fight for socialism and internationalism is bitterly opposed by the pseudo left groups socialist aotearoa sa international socialist organisation iso and the more recently formed organise aotearoa which seek to politically subordinate workers to the labour nz first greens government and the trade union bureaucracy these groups are not socialist or left wing but represent layers of the upper middle class seeking to advance their positions within capitalism their bread and butter is identity politics which is used to sow divisions among workers based on race and gender while promoting reactionary politicians such as the mana party s hone harawira who fraudulently claim to represent maori workers and the poor before the election sa denounced opposition to a labour led government as sectarian the iso hailed labour s coalition deal with the right wing nz first as better than dared hope possible saying it would bring real benefits to the lives of working people the pseudo lefts falsely insist that the unions remain genuine workers organisations that can pressure the government to make progressive reforms during the nurses and teachers disputes the three groups opposed a break from the unions the iso portrayed both sellout deals as partial victories while sa and oa encouraged the illusion that the nzno bureaucracy could be reformed like their counterparts internationally the iso and sa have embraced imperialism both organisations supported the us proxy war for regime change in syria fraudulently portraying it as a revolution at the same time as the us ramped up its war drive they denounced us rivals russia and china as imperialist the pseudo lefts have abandoned any defense of julian assange who is imprisoned in britain and faces extradition to the us for the crime of exposing us war crimes in iraq and afghanistan likewise they are silent on courageous whistleblower chelsea manning who has been imprisoned in the us for refusing to testify against assange fight for socialism and internationalism join the socialist equality group the reactionary record of the ardern government points to the historical bankruptcy of social democracy labour s embrace of the racist nz first and attacks on immigrants who make up one quarter of new zealand s population is the sharpest expression of its hostility to the working class as a whole the government has refused to give in to any of the demands of working people for decent wages resourcing and funding for services including health and education now it is strengthening police state measures and preparing the country to join devastating us led wars involving nuclear armed powers as another election approaches the working class stands at a crossroads the chief danger facing workers and youth is the lack of a socialist party politically independent of labour and all the bourgeois parties the socialist equality group seg is the only organisation that has consistently fought to warn working people about the reactionary agenda of the ardern government the seg exposed the lie by labour s pseudo left allies that the labour nz first alliance represents a lesser evil to the national party we call on workers and young people to break from the labour party and all its supporters including the greens and the trade union bureaucracy the seg is fighting to build a section in new zealand of the international committee of the fourth international icfi the fourth international is the world party of socialist revolution founded by leon trotsky in 1938 based on the strategy of uniting the working class internationally in opposition to the stalinist bureaucracy which betrayed the russian revolution and strangled socialist movements throughout the world the icfi has fought for decades to uphold this internationalist perspective in opposition to stalinism maoism and every other form of nationalism and opportunism a socialist movement can only be built in a struggle against the nationalist poison peddled by the entire political establishment the working class in new zealand must unite across all nationalities and ethnicities and forge close links with the powerful mass movements that are erupting throughout the world this requires the uncompromising defence of immigrants rights to live and work with full democratic and citizenship rights objective conditions have emerged for working people of all countries to be united in a revolutionary movement to overthrow capitalism put an end to the outmoded division of the world into rival nation states and build a socialist society the establishment of workers governments that will expropriate the banks and major industries place them under democratic control of the working class and abolish national borders is the only way to avert the catastrophes of economic depression climate change and world war we urge those who agree with this perspective to join and fight to build the socialist

a robust u s economy that has proved solid and durable will be one of the highlights tuesday night when president trump gives his third state of the union address trump will deliver an optimistic inspirational forward looking state of the union address according to presidential adviser kellyanne conway who quipped that success is the best revenge nine months before the election the economy keeps growing steadily if only modestly unemployment is at a half century low consumers the quintessence of the u s economy continue to spend average pay is rising faster than when trump took office three years ago with the largest percentage gains now going to lower wage workers i m proud to declare that the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before trump said last month in davos switzerland america is thriving america is flourishing and yes america is winning again like never before by the numbers here is a deep dive into the american economy under the trump administration trump aims for optimistic state of the union on eve of final impeachment vote success is the best revenge growth greater productivity is one of the two main drivers of growth the other is an increase in the number of u s workers both have slowed in the past decade economic growth was 2 3 percent in 2019 matching the average pace since the great recession ended a decade ago in the first year of barack obama s eight year presidency during the 2016 campaign trump boasted that his tax cut plan would boost annual growth to 4 percent a year a brisk pace not seen since the late 1990s instead trump is one of two presidents along with obama since world war ii not to have presided over a year of at least 3 percent growth few economists think the economy will hit that target this year taxes most analysts do think trump s tax plan helped accelerate growth just not the way he had promised the trump tax cuts were a sugar high that juiced the economy temporarily said ryan sweet an economist at moody s analytics it put more money in americans pockets boosting consumer spending the economy grew 2 9 percent in 2018 a healthy pace though the same as in 2015 the year before trump s election the administration had vowed though that the tax cuts would do more than just encourage americans to shop more the president s top economists had said the tax cuts would accelerate corporate investment in machinery computers and plants and office towers all the new equipment would make workers more efficient the argument went thereby boosting productivity the amount of output for each hour worked trade most economists partly blame the stall on trump s trade wars particularly with china the trade conflicts have left american companies much less certain about the economic outlook and reluctant to expand and invest business investment shrank in the final three quarters of last year nor have trump s business tax cuts and deregulation made the economy more dynamic the growth of new companies has remained anemic since the 2008 downturn larger businesses continue to dominate many industries from technology to retail to finance all this is occurring despite significant stimulus trump has assailed fed chairman jerome powell for not cutting rates more though the fed s benchmark rate is now in a range of just 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent a very low level historically and one that is considered stimulative increased federal spending also has helped support the economy the congressional budget office last week projected that the government s deficit will top 1 trillion annually for the next decade jobs trump recently has highlighted what he calls a blue collar boom pointing to solid wage gains for lower paid workers and healthy hiring in construction and manufacturing but manufacturing jobs barely grew last year as factories hunkered down in the midst of the trade wars since trump s inauguration manufacturing jobs have grown more slowly than employment overall has ernie goss an economics professor at creighton university in nebraska said the midwest s job growth has amounted to only about three quarters of the national pace since trump took office farmers also have suffered from the trade war he said as retaliatory tariffs by china have clobbered exports of soybeans and other commodities that in turn has hurt manufacturers of farm equipment including deere and caterpillar everyone says the economy is going great guns but that is everything except agriculture and manufacturing goss said what s more most campaign battleground states in the midwest such as michigan pennsylvania ohio and wisconsin have lost factory jobs in the past year most manufacturing job growth under trump s presidency has occurred in southern and western states said dean baker senior economist at the liberal center for economic and policy research with fewer union members in those states those factory jobs generally pay less in fact manufacturing jobs once a safeguard of the postwar middle class now pay less on average than private sector jobs overall baker said click here to get the fox news app more people have come off the sidelines and found jobs however defying most economists predictions the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who are employed is now higher than before the great recession last year wages rose nearly 5 percent for the poorest one fourth of americans far more than for the richest fourth whose pay rose just 3 percent according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta still richer americans hold a far greater portion of the nation s wealth with the top 10 percent owning nearly 85 percent of the value of all stocks the moderate pace of growth has meant that so far the economy isn t showing evident signs of excess akin to the housing bubble that led to the 2008 financial meltdown the associated press contributed to this report

the past few two weeks has been a strategy for short term love only it s not resulted in a portfolio you could take home and introduce to mum and dad while i fully acknowledge the strong earnings and data from the united states indeed pre wuhan crisis i fully expected the us to continue to outperform the rest of the developed world those earnings and data points though are backwards facing and the potential impact of the wuhan virus is nowhere near yet being able to be fully quantified in its implications for global growth nothing has intrinsically changed vis a vis the wuhan viral outbreak cases and deaths are still growing by the day sadly although still mostly confined to mainland china what is visible are the closing borders the thousands of cancelled flights the reports of slumping demand for energy and china enterprises are very publicly considering declaring force majeures and reducing oil refining throughput asian lng prices in fact hit record lows today as consumption slumps in the world s 2nd largest market china therefore today s rebound should be treated as such a potentially ill advised rush into a new relationship soon after the previous one ended in acrimony investors should hold off assuming their portfolios are the one today and telling mum to book churches and start on the guest lists elsewhere in asia the reserve bank of australia rba held rates steady at record lows of 0 75 a slight uptick in employment was all the rba needed to keep its powder dry with little powder left at these levels using it frugally in the face of a potential wuhan virus slowdown is a wise decision hong kong retail sales are released at 1630 sgt and are expected to post a mind boggling drop of 25 in december the ongoing protests have sapped the sar s economy with nary a merry christmas in sight the respite from the demonstrations due to the wuhan virus is unlikely to bring a respite in fact it may well make things worse with hong kong s economy likely to be in the isolation ward for quite some time to come the data calendar is light in europe with the us factory orders data later likely to be today s highlight forecasts are for a rebound to 1 20 mom for december tomorrow becomes altogether more interesting with china s caixin services pmi for january indonesian gdp european retail sales and us balance of trade the elephant in the room remains though developments on the wuhan virus crisis equities wall street rebounded on strong earnings and factory orders overnight with the s p 500 rising 0 65 the nasdaq by 1 50 and the dow jones by 0 50 that positive tone however misguided spilt over into asia with the region enjoying a good day led by mainland china bourses the shanghai composite rose 1 30 the csi 300 by 1 35 and japan s nikkei 225 by 0 60 the hang seng rose by 1 0 with korea s kospi jumping 2 0 we note though that the gains have been somewhat pared across the board from today s earlier highs suggesting that the bullish momentum has waned and that investors are reluctant to carry short term risk overnight the positive finish by asia should be enough to propel european stock markets cautiously higher but recent bounces by equities have vanished as fast as they appeared recently with the wuhan virus crisis still in full flight rallies should be treated with a huge grain of salt currencies the us dollar rallied overnight boosted by rising us treasury yields as some of the rush to safety in government bonds unwound the japanese yen and swiss franc gave back some of their gains but the dollar also made headway against the euro and pound which fell to 1 1060 and 1 3000 respectively for the most part the dollar has held onto its gains in a quiet asian session against regional asian currencies it was mostly unchanged with volumes light with the fx market refusing to by into the hype and hope shown by equities the usd cnh rose to 7 0250 in early trading its second failure in two days at that level before falling back below 7 0000 to 6 9950 as china s stock exchanges move higher intra session the cnh is unlikely to move below 6 9500 anytime soon however it has most likely settled into a 6 9500 7 0500 range in the near term chinese authorities will not want to see either the onshore or offshore yuan weaken too rapidly from these levels for fear of upsetting the americans oil oil was crushed overnight as the wuhan virus growth fears turned into a panic stampede for the exit door brent crude lumped 4 0 to 54 50 and wti fell 3 0 to 50 10 a barrel having fallen below the 50 00 level briefly earlier in the session today in asia oil has managed to trace out a modest rally as confidence peeked its head above the parapet in equity markets brent crude rose 1 25 to 55 00 a barrel and wti rose 1 20 to 50 70 a barrel measured against the scale of oil s fall from grace today s rally appears to be more corrective than structural speculation that opec will meet and enact more production cuts has offered some support brent crude below 55 00 a barrel is the stuff of sleepless nights for opec and russia we will almost certainly see some action sooner than later from the grouping with the threat of force majeure s from chinese importers hanging over energy markets direct action is required further cuts though from opec are likely only to stabilise prices not be of the scale to engineer a structural rally with the wuhan virus presenting an as yet unquantifiable threat to global growth oil remains one of the most vulnerable commodities to further bad news treat today s rally with caution gold gold eased slightly overnight as the us dollar and treasury yield rose it fell 0 50 to 1577 00 an ounce with equities moving firmly higher in asia today golds retreat continued falling 0 50 again to 1571 00 an ounce gold has now tested and failed on three consecutive days the 1590 00 level which is now reasonably strong technical resistance short term support lies nearby at 1570 00 an ounce followed by 1550 00 an ounce most of the near term bad news from the wuhan virus outbreak appears to be fully priced into gold at these levels gold is lacking upward momentum at this time and likely requires another slew of bad headlines to regain its mojo in the meantime a continued equity rally from europe and into the united states today increases the chances that gold s short term correction lower has

previous political experience chair maryland democratic party candidate for governor of maryland chief of staff office of congressman charles rangel professional staff us house of representatives ways and means committee congressional black caucus foundation fellow office of congressman melvin watt why are you running for office building on the legacy of my late husband elijah cummings i am running to drive inclusive prosperity in the baltimore region and across the nation i seek to 1 promote quality education and training opportunities for our youth 2 increase access to affordable health care and prescription drugs and 3 spur equitable economic growth that revitalizes neighborhoods connects people to transit and good secure jobs i am the best person to continue the progress being made to ensure our economy works for everyone not just those at the top trump record how do you assess the trump administration so far name at least one positive and one negative the trump administration s failures are too many to list but locking children in cages and separating families as immigration policy the muslim ban pulling out of the paris climate agreement using the power of the presidency to intimidate world leaders to perform political favors defending racist violence in charlottesville and governing by tweet are stand outs one positive has been the tremendous engagement and inspiring new energy in american politics over the past four years from the women s march to the parkland students women and young people are getting involved fighting for real change running for office and winning and i m heartened about what that means for the 2020 election 2017 tax cuts what effect do you believe the federal tax cuts of 2017 have had on the economy thus far or will have in the future and why do you support the cuts the tax cuts of 2017 the majority of which went to wealthy individuals and corporations did not pay for themselves had little measurable impact on the economy and have exploded federal deficits the 2017 trump tax cuts also placed a heavier burden on working people and allowed the rich to get richer in congress i will advocate for progressive tax reform that relieves the burden on working people and demands the 1 pay their fair share i believe we need to strengthen the middle class and provide the working poor a viable path to upward mobility tax cuts for the wealthiest among us compromise those goals and the deficits they produce tee up arguments to defund public services essential to low income and working families income inequality is the level of economic inequality in the united states a problem and why or why not what if anything should the federal government do to address it in congress i ll address record income inequality with a suite of policies that are fair to workers unions have been under assault for decades and it s time to reverse that we must strengthen equal employment laws to address discrimination tax treatment of unearned income should be on par with earned income and unfair loopholes and subsidies in the tax code for the rich should be removed gun laws should federal gun laws be changed and if so how and why gun violence is a dangerous threat in congress i will work to pass common sense gun safety laws including banning automatic assault rifles closing gun show loopholes and passing universal background checks gun owners should be required to insure their firearms i ll take on the nra and the politicians beholden to them so we can address traumatic gun violence in our communities health care what should congress do with respect to the affordable care act how and why if you believe it should be scrapped what if anything should replace it health care should be a human right the affordable care act was a big step in the right direction but it never achieved universal coverage and it has been undermined by republicans legal and regulatory challenges a federal single payer national healthcare system that provides every single person access to high quality health care should be the foundation of coverage in the u s i am open to how it is designed as long as it is universal high quality and affordable scaling medicare to serve as the national system could very well be the answer but i m also open to other possible solutions that are affordable high quality and universal urban policy what role should the federal government play in helping cities what if anything would you do for baltimore specifically the federal government should fund inclusive growth investments for cities with deep poverty and inequality i would seek to leverage federal dollars to upgrade our infrastructure such as roads transit housing and recreation in economically depressed areas i would prioritize approaches that promote the redevelopment renovation and repopulation of existing housing stock and seek to dramatically improve transit oriented development with transportation options that better move people around the city and region additionally because we are losing a generation of our youth to crime violence and lack of opportunity the inclusive growth strategy must include investments in our youth opioids do you back elijah cummings bill which republicans say is too expensive to provide 100 billion over 10 years to fight the opioid epidemic why or why not yes from greenmount east to cooksville our friends and neighbors are overdosing families are being ripped apart entire communities are being destroyed by the opioid epidemic it s very clear that this is a major public health crisis and it s time we start treating it as such and fighting this epidemic with everything we have my husband was keenly aware of what needed to be done to tackle this crisis head on and get families communities and states the resources they need and in congress i ll keep fighting to ensure this bill becomes law immigration what changes if any should congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies should the daca program be preserved why or why not i stand for love respect diversity and inclusion these values should drive our immigration policy i ll work to reunite families separated at the border lift travel bans and reverse cuts to the refugee program i ll support comprehensive immigration reform with a clear pathway to citizenship and a permanent citizenship solution for immigrants who arrived in the united states as children trade how would you rate the trump administration s trade stance with china and why i would give the trump administration an f on its ill advised trade war which has been destructive counterproductive and has negatively impacted the industries that rely on a robust export economy trump started an unnecessary and costly trade war with china and it is american families and taxpayers that are paying the steep price not only are goods more expensive trump has allocated billions to fund a bailout for farmers and domestic manufacturers harmed by his actions he does not deserve any credit for attempting to clean up the mess he recklessly started iran do you support the president s decision to pull out of the iran nuclear deal why or why not president obama s administration worked for years to get to a deal that would cease iran s nuclear activity and trump walked away with absolutely no plan of what comes next and since then we ve seen iran becomes increasingly hostile and take aggressive steps towards building their own nuclear arms it appears that president trump has absolutely no strategic plan in place and even more concerning is his concerted efforts to escalate every international incident to make matters worse the world is more dangerous because of president trump s haphazard foreign policy decisions north korea how should the united states address the rise of north korea s nuclear program north korea s continual testing of long range missiles and weapons of mass destruction is a threat to the united states one of the most dangerous and complex issues of our time instead of working with international partners to stop this aggression trump has warmly embraced kim jong un and his dictatorial and murderous rule our country needs to make foreign policy decisions based on american values and national security interests not whether a brutal dictator strokes trump s ego climate change how should the united states address climate change climate change is one of the biggest threats to our country and our future we need a robust and aggressive plan to mitigate the effects of climate change and while protecting this planet for the next generation this requires a rapid transition to clean energy sources and green technology and infrastructure and decommissioning the use of fossil fuels and its associated technologies and infrastructure green new deal do you support the green new deal why or why not

added that special agro processing zones could promote agro industrial development and employment however insecurity could deter foreign investors shrivel the domestic economy and ultimately dampen prospects for economic growth it said it added that high unemployment could create social tensions just as rising public debt and associated funding costs could pose fiscal risks if proposed adjustments were not implemented the bank said nigeria s oil exports could be affected by developments in the middle east trade tensions between the united states and china could weaken global growth and lower demand for nigeria s products including oil it said the afdb said prolonged closure of borders by nigeria to curb smuggling could affect trade with other countries in west africa and raise the prices of imported products especially rice these risks underscored the need to accelerate structural reforms to promote economic diversification and industrialisation to minimise vulnerability to

douglas col vice president and chief financial officer thank you brittany good morning everyone welcome to saia s fourth quarter 2019 conference call with me for today s call are rick o dell saia s chief executive officer and fritz holzgrefe our president and chief operating officer before we begin you should know that during the call we may make some forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these forward looking statements and all other statements that might be made on this call that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially we refer you to our press release and our most recent sec filings for more information on the exact risk factors that could cause actual results to differ now i would like to turn the call over to rick o dell richard d o dell chief executive officer well good morning and thank you for joining us i m pleased to report that we closed out 2019 with record full year results despite a fourth quarter that was somewhat disappointing our revenue in 2019 was a record 1 8 billion surpassing last year s record by 8 operating income also grew by 8 to a record 153 million our fourth quarter revenue was a record 443 million the quarter s results were negatively impacted by terminal opening and relocation costs as well as accident severity which doug will cover in more detail in a financial review despite the challenges to the fourth quarter results associated with opening three new terminals and relocating three others in the period productivity for the full year actually improved modestly in both the dock and city operations and our linehaul operation declining weight per shipment throughout the year led to a slight decline in load average but we were able to reduce our linehaul cost as a percent of revenue by 2 2 and purchase transportation miles as a percent of total linehaul miles dropped to 10 3 from 10 6 last year i m pleased to report that both on time pickup and on time delivery metrics improved year over year despite all the terminal activity and the growth of our workforce our cargo claims ratio for the full year of 0 76 was slightly improved from 0 77 last year despite again all the new terminals and all the new employees as 2020 began saia operates 168 terminals across 43 states having opened nine new locations in 2019 since may of 2017 we ve opened 18 new terminals across new markets in the northeastern us our expanded service offering has quickly resonated with our customer base and exiting the fourth quarter were on an annualized run rate of over 280 million into and out of these new markets we ve enhanced geographic service offering and our consistent quality and reliability we re raising our value proposition to customers our yield rose 3 7 in the fourth quarter making our 38th consecutive year over year improvement i will now turn the call over to doug for a review of key fourth quarter and full year financial highlights douglas col vice president and chief financial officer thanks rick i ll start with a review of the fourth quarter revenue rose 8 9 to 443 million along with the yield improvement rick mentioned revenue also benefited from shipment and tonnage growth of 6 3 and 4 3 respectively in the quarter fuel surcharge revenue was up 2 2 year over year and was 13 of total revenue despite a 1 9 decline in weight per shipment our revenue per shipment rose 1 8 to 238 benefiting from the yield growth and also from a 1 1 increase in our length of haul operating income of 27 million in the fourth quarter was down 18 year over year with much of the decline stemming from costs associated with three new terminal openings and three major terminal relocations which occurred in the quarter along with increased insurance reserves associated with accident severity additionally on the cost front i can offer a little bit more color on the quarter as follows salaries wages and benefits rose by 10 7 reflecting our average employee count being approximately 5 higher than the prior year our july wage increase for approximately 3 5 and continued inflationary healthcare costs purchased transportation costs increased 10 1 year over year from a combination of 7 1 growth in pt miles and 10 6 growth in purchase rail miles our overall pt miles were 9 8 of total miles compared to 9 6 of total miles in the fourth quarter last year fuel expenses fell by 0 8 in the quarter as national average diesel prices were 5 to 6 lower throughout the quarter compared to last year our miles per gallon across the fleet continues to improve as well and helped to offset the fuel costs associated with our mileage growth of approximately 6 claims and insurance expense spiked by 50 in the quarter due primarily to accident severity our cargo claims ratio of 0 83 was also up from 0 75 a year ago but improved through the quarter as continuous training efforts began to produce a benefit with our newest dock associates depreciation expense of 31 9 million in the quarter was 17 higher than last year matching the trend we saw throughout the year and reflects our investments in revenue equipment properties and technology the average age of our tractors is now less than five years overall operating expenses grew by 11 3 in the quarter outpacing our 8 9 revenue growth and fourth quarter operating ratio deteriorated to 93 8 compared to 91 8 a year ago our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18 1 compared to 19 9 last year the tax rate was positively impacted by the enactment of an alternative fuel tax credit in the fourth quarter that covered 2018 and 2019 reporting periods fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were 0 81 compared to 0 97 the prior year the previously mentioned fuel tax credit benefited fourth quarter eps by 0 07 moving onto the financial highlights for our full year 2019 revenue was a record 1 8 billion and operating income of 153 million was also an annual record our operating ratio held flat in 2019 at 91 5 for the full year 2019 our diluted earnings per share were 4 30 versus 3 99 in 2018 and again the reported 2019 eps benefited by 0 07 as a result of the previously mentioned enactment of the alternative fuel tax credit at december 31 2019 our total debt was 136 million and net debt to capital was 14 3 this compares to total debt of 123 million and net debt to total capital of 14 8 at december 31 2018 net capital expenditures in 2019 were 287 million including equipment we acquired with capital leases this compares to 252 million of net capital expenditures in 2018 in 2020 net capital expenditures are forecast we approximately 250 million including investments in real estate terminal infrastructure improvement projects our fleet and continued investments in technology before we open the line up for questions i d like to turn the call over to fritz holzgrefe for some closing remarks frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer thanks doug while we all would certainly like to closed out the year with stronger operating margins i m pleased with the company s growth trajectory and how our company is positioned as we move into 2020 rick mentioned the nine new terminal openings we completed in 2019 but i also like to highlight some major terminal relocations that position us for long term share gains and better service across our network in january the past year we ve moved into a new owned facility in harrisburg pennsylvania more than doubling the size of our former lease terminal in that market the new locational service for years to come as a major break facility in northeastern us other major terminal upgrades occurred in indianapolis and phoenix where we relocated to new own terminals in both markets essentially doubling our door counts at both locations in philadelphia newburgh new york we relocated the larger terminals and we are growing the terminals opened in those markets within the last two years our total door count the northeast grew by 112 in 2019 in 2020 our current plan calls for one new terminal opening in the first quarter and then we have a handful relocation slated for the balance of the year the line share of our capital expenditures in 2020 will once again be directed toward our fleet as doug mentioned the average age of our tractor fleet is now less than five years and should dip below four years in 2020 based on our planned purchases improved fuel mileage greater reliability at a full suite of in cab safety technology that comes with new tractors are all benefits of lowering the fleet age with new buyers and finally with respect to the current freight environment we continue to view freight activity is somewhat muted in fairness january is one of the softest months seasonally in our business so i don t want to read too much into one month against the easing comps january shipments per day grew 8 while tonnage per day grew 7 7 the most encouraging trend over the last couple of months is the weight per shipment trend seems to be in the bottoming process weight per shipment in january was 1 304 pounds in line with what we saw in november and december we re excited about the investments to date as we feel they position us for share and margin improvement in 2020 and beyond with that said i d like to go ahead and open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator yes sir thank you our first question comes from jack atkins with stephens incorporated jack atkins stephens inc analyst good morning thanks so much for taking my questions richard d o dell chief executive officer good morning jack jack atkins stephens inc analyst so i guess just to start off fritz going back to your last comment on on just sort of the underlying freight market could you update us on what the december tonnage and shipment metrics were and then it seems like there s been a step up in demand and in tonnage here over the last couple of months judging by december and january and just sort of curious what do you think is driving that is that just purely a function of easier comps or do you feel like in the last maybe six to eight weeks things have begun to maybe stabilize to improve a bit out there frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer i ll take that first part of that jack i ll take you guys through the shipments and tonnage growth throughout the quarter and we ll start with october shipments were up 6 9 and tonnage was up 3 5 in november shipments were up 2 7 and tonnage up 1 4 and then as you mentioned december things picked up a little bit our shipments were up 10 and our tonnage was up 9 and the december comparison was up against negative shipments and tonnage a year ago shipments a year ago in november october november have been positive so the comps did get easier jack atkins stephens inc analyst got you frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer in terms of the environment we re seeing i mean it s the same number as you re seeing i mean industrial production was down in december i think that was the fourth out of the last six months where it was down the pmi trends have been negative for five or six months now once they turn negative so it s tough to say now any more than that because january seasonally the weakest month of the quarter anyway so it s kind of hard to call out any kind of difference in pace with the environment when it s our seasonally softest month jack atkins stephens inc analyst okay got you the good news is we just saw our pmi above 50 here in january just spread it so that s encouraging so i guess just shifting gears up to the margin front for a moment could you update us on your outlook for or improvement in 2020 i think on the third quarter call you were saying 100 basis points to 150 basis points of improvement from margin perspective year over year in 2020 versus 2019 is that still the plan and then can you help us sort of bridge to that number whether it s productivity improvements from having a younger fleet age and then just sort of the leverage that you expect to get on these investments i think just helping to bridge to that number would be very helpful for folks richard d o dell chief executive officer okay i ll start and then maybe fritz probably add some comments as well or doug will historically historical seasonality 4q to 1q would have a modest deterioration in or about 20 basis points and but kind of given our current outlook january performance we would expect at this point a modest improvement up to a 100 basis points and again we don t know what the weather is going to be like the rest of the quarter we always have some self insurance volatility exposure but our outlook would be in that range at this point in time and again there are some carry forward costs from the 3q and 4q terminal openings and but we re confident i think in our ability over time to apply top line revenue to that and get the or improvements that we ve talked about historically as well you want to add something else fritz frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah the only thing i would add to that jack is that as we know the fleet improvements that we ve made last year and actually last several years into this year that creates a pretty big step up in depreciation over year year over year that we re going to have to cover we re obviously going to have inflationary costs in all the areas that you typically would see is going to be some market based wage inflation benefit costs all that sort of thing but with that said we re tracking early on and we re not quite ready to give the highlights of it but investments in technology across not only the fleet but then also our operations in planning systems where we think we can look for ways to drive productivity improvement on our dock city and linehaul operations and those investments that we have made in the last several quarters that we would hope to see help drive that margin improvement in 2020 and frankly beyond as we sort as we have moved into these northeast markets those are as we know high cost markets and the benefits of productivity certainly will help us drive those margin improvements into the coming year jack atkins stephens inc analyst got you so the plan is still 100 basis points to 150 basis points of margin improvement in 2020 richard d o dell chief executive officer i think that s fair frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah jack atkins stephens inc analyst okay richard d o dell chief executive officer i mean it won t be linear across the quarters right but i mean i think that s that would be our expectation i mean we clearly realize this is a show me year i mean we ve made the decision that i think is strategically correct to open some incremental terminals but we ve made a lot of investments and we expect to get an adequate return on it jack atkins stephens inc analyst okay great thank you again for the time richard d o dell chief executive officer thanks jack operator our next question comes from todd fowler with keybanc capital markets todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst thanks and good morning richard d o dell chief executive officer good morning todd todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst and doug congratulations officially on a new role maybe just to start fritz some comments were attributed to you in the release about the pricing environment remaining rational i was just hoping you could maybe expand on that and if you ve seen any changes in behavior in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and maybe some comments about where contract renewals are right now frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah so we ve seen 20 or the end of the year and the next year to be kind of competitive rational environment around pricing i mean everybody has got a deal with the inflationary costs so i think people are have that backdrop and i think that as we continue to see in the marketplace we see people be competitive but at the same time you see them performing rationally so that s continues to be a good thing a good part of our market and our strategy right now our contractual renewals in the quarter were douglas col vice president and chief financial officer 5 4 frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer 5 4 todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst okay so that s pretty consistent i think they were around 5 5 in the third quarter so frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst i guess just to maybe put a little bit of a bowline it it sounds like that with where we re at in the cycle pricing behavior is kind of what you would expect but you re still seeing those mid single digit contract renewals frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah so far todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst okay good and then just to shift gears and talk about the expansion it sounds like that there s going to be one terminal opening in 2020 i think that that brings you to about 19 in total you d previously talked about 20 to 25 is there a change in the number of terminals that you need in the northeast or is it just a timing where you ve pulled forward some of the growth into 19 you take a breather in 20 and then accelerates again in 21 can you just help us think about kind of the number of terminals and where you re at from a geographic expansion standpoint richard d o dell chief executive officer i think the way i would characterize it todd is if you go back to when we launched our northeast plan we talked about 20 to 25 terminals probably gives us pretty good coverage over time and the great thing about an organic expansion is it allows us to speed up or slow down as we see the opportunities so we saw opportunities last year so we accelerated our pace and the timing q3 and q4 that had obviously had an impact on our results but we re looking at this as a long term sort of investment so the quarter to quarter nature of it that s part of the investment profile i think as we look longer term in the northeast i mean i think that sort of 20 to 25 number is probably reasonable but at the same time you could as that business evolves we may see other opportunities to provide incremental coverage in that market as the market develops for us so i don t know that i would say that we re at the end but i think those continue to be opportunistic in that market but this year in 2020 as we look at where we are it s an opportunity to really to generate a return on all those investments we ve made to date in the market particularly in the last six months of 2019 todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst okay got it that makes sense and maybe just the last question for me and it s kind of along those lines but the 280 million of run rate par revenue in the northeast do you care to share kind of a sense of what the margin profile on that is relative to the business and the genesis for the question is obviously thinking about the drag that s happening and the opportunity of where that can go as you leverage the investment that you ve made thanks richard d o dell chief executive officer yeah so i think the way i would characterize that is that in a network business the impact of growth in the northeast kind of touches all corners of our company if i looked at specifically at those the full all in or for those that northeast in the fourth quarter it was over 100 but that we also know that was an investment period we know that over time i think what this does it s going to drive our overall we ll be able to drive the overall or in that region it s something more in line with the rest of the company but at the same time the benefits of that incremental growth will impact the balance of the company as well so i think that that s still intact the value the what we can drive out of that area that doesn t change it s just the expenses were pretty heavy in the last half of the year todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst got it no that makes sense especially with the halo impact on the other regions so i ll jump back in the queue thanks for the time richard d o dell chief executive officer yeah operator our next question comes from scott group with wolfe research scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks good morning guys richard d o dell chief executive officer good morning frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer good morning scott group wolfe research analyst so i wanted to follow up on the full year or commentary so first quarter doesn t imply and placed flattish margins second quarter has got the toughest comp of the year so the or improvement sort of back end loaded is that just the comps are a lot easier or is there anything about costs or anything that that builds throughout the year i just want to understand the trajectory douglas col vice president and chief financial officer i think it s a combination of comps and some of our targeted cost improvements but it s primarily kind of driven by the comps right the set back half of the year first quarter wasn t great either but the back half of the year was margins weren t we were making some investments we had some self insurance volatility the combination of things i think are just are easier in the back half and as we have commented we weren t particularly pleased with our fourth quarter performance i mean it was an investment quarter but with the revenue growth that we re having we would expect to operate better than we did and certainly do going forward as well scott group wolfe research analyst okay and then on the can you give us any sort of either the revenue per day or yield trends to start the year i just want to understand them is the the tonnage obviously picking up but is there any sort of offset there in terms of yield slowing or anything richard d o dell chief executive officer i just still it s one month right but our yield trends were similar going into the first in the first quarter as we had in the fourth quarter from an improvement perspective and then so you can take the tonnage we quoted and assume a similar number you re going to get to the revenue scott group wolfe research analyst okay and then my last question on the pickup in weight per shipment can you tell what if anything is driving that is there any sort of pickup in the tl rated freight or is it just economy what do you think is driving the weight per shipment higher richard d o dell chief executive officer so scott i would say that it s just kind of a broad base there s not really a call out there for a specific market or vertical or something like that as always we re going to be focused on driving or identifying that freight that s going to have the best characteristics to drive the incremental margin in our business that maybe there s some efforts there that are helping to drive that but i think overall it s pretty broad based scott group wolfe research analyst but you re not making a push to try and fill up the network with some tl business or anything frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer no not any more than we normally take advantage of that scott group wolfe research analyst all right thank you guys richard d o dell chief executive officer okay operator our next question comes from amit mehrotra with deutsche bank amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst thanks operator hi everybody congrats doug as well fritz just a quick follow up the depreciation expense that obviously stepped up quite a bit in 19 what s the run rate quarterly i assume it s flat so tab i know you got one additional in 2020 in terms of a new service center opening up or terminal opening up but any help there douglas col vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would just say i mean in 2019 i guess for the full year i mean depreciation was up almost 17 and the total capex number was projected to come down in 2020 but with the heavy over 50 of it being on revenue equipment i d say depreciation in 2020 is probably likely to be up another 19 or 20 year over year amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst from 19 to 20 20 up year over year douglas col vice president and chief financial officer yes amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay richard d o dell chief executive officer yes so you re going to have the lapping effect of what we added last year plus the new equipment that comes online in 2020 amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay interesting okay that s just a lot higher than i would have expected but maybe i did something wrong there okay and then one question yeah go ahead richard d o dell chief executive officer amit i don t think anything is wrong but i mean we opened since mid september we opened six new terminals and relocated four other ones into new facilities so i mean a lot of investment there plus the equipment that goes in all those facilities so like fritz said i mean it s just it s the run rate coming out amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst yeah it just looks like i modeled that wrong yeah i just modeled that wrong it s really my fault and then i just wanted to ask a question on the decline in weight per shipment in the quarter i just want to i know it s a little bit backward looking but it s a little bit of an outlier especially when you think about northeast not being as dilutive to weight per shipment i think you said that before in the past so were there any i guess mix headwinds in the quarter i know you talked about maybe november being a particularly weak month in and out of the houston market o patch market just talk about that and what is did that revert at all or has that reverted at all as you started the year so obviously that was a pretty big drag i guess in the month of november at very least douglas col vice president and chief financial officer no i mean year over year throughout the quarter the weight per shipment call it declines from the prior year actually lessen right so october weight per shipment was down 3 2 november weight per shipment was down 1 2 and then december weight per shipment was down less than 1 so i mean year over year the quarter actually saw things get a little stronger and like rick mentioned earlier i mean we seem to be or fritz mentioned we seem to be bouncing along the bottom here i mean november and december weight per shipment was pretty much right where it that here in january amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay right yeah and then one may be bigger picture question from me i guess this is for rick or fritz just given the i guess the margin opportunity in 2020 it s kind of i guess it s kind of a unique year in terms of your ability to realize margin improvement and structural cost absorption relative to past years i guess what are you guys doing from if anything from an operational or execution oversight perspective that s different in the past i mean is there anything that you re doing in terms of higher operational intensity oversight perspective that just gives you a little bit more confidence or more confidence that the opportunity that you guys see over the next 12 months that s should going to be realized you guys doing precision scheduled rail broadening or something like that richard d o dell chief executive officer well i think i mean we ve got a couple of elements that we re building momentum around that we re pretty we re excited about i mentioned earlier that we have made investments in technology across all the major cost drivers in our operating in our network which we feel like over the course of the year will help us drive the sort of incremental margins i think the there is clearly we ve invested a lot in our industrial engineering group and our operations and analytics group that relative to the past where i think we start to see some of the benefits of that into this year i also think quite frankly that part of the new england or sorry the new east northeast benefit that we should see as we continue to execute our strategy there we ll be in a position to leverage those assets into 2020 and beyond where i think that that will help those that will be at an accelerated pace compared to what we dealt with in the third and fourth quarters simply as they mature so i think that it s a combination of technology investment and people will help us drive those sort of incremental returns over time frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah i would just comment to that the same engine amit the same kind of engineering and some of our operations leadership that was responsible for opening the terminals and training people and do it all those things you don t have some of those costs and then the focus of those of that team of people is more on executing throughout our geography as opposed to traveling to the northeast and doing training and opening terminals amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst yeah now that s a good point and then just following back one very quickly on the d a does it step up from the current run rate in the first half and then kind of normalize in the back half is that the right cadence or does it just continue to step up through the course of 2020 frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah i d say those are my options it s going to trend up throughout the year a little bit amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst yeah frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer as we ll make as we take delivery of equipment and we ve got a few real estate projects going on just shop opening a couple of new shops we ve got a couple more relocations this year so i d say it will trend up through the year to that number amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay that s helpful thanks everybody appreciate the time operator our next question comes from david ross with stifel david ross stifel analyst yes good morning gentlemen richard d o dell chief executive officer good morning david ross stifel analyst wanted to touch on insurance it s been thorn in your side for a while of and on and it s getting a lot of attention on the truckload side of things these days when you look at 2020 do you have a decent renewal coming up at any point i can t imagine these accidents are helping any potential premium increase so how do you think about insurance costs as we move into the new year douglas col vice president and chief financial officer hi david i mean obviously i mean you mentioned i mean we re in a very tight markets in terms of truckers looking for insurance on the auto liability side that s been the case for the last two or three years though i d say from rc while we did have an accident that you re referring to in q4 that s high on the severity list our claims experienced over the last few years has been as good as any i would imagine i ve been on the road a lot meeting with some of the prospective insurance companies and i really think after sitting a lot of these meetings that we ve got a best in class kind of approach to safety in terms of the technology what we put in our tractors these days our new buyers as fritz mentioned they come in loaded with the full suite of everything from forward and inward facing cameras to blind spot detection this year for the first time we ll be buying tractors that have what they call level two autonomy so nobody is doing more on that front i don t think than we are so our renewal we re a march one renewal the process is well under way we ll continue to hold our deductible or retention at 2 million i don t see that changing but building out the tower is inflationary but again i think we re better positioned than most and we look for a successful renew it although with some inflation as you get up into the tower david ross stifel analyst so if you have better accident experience in terms of frequency and severity this year even with the insurance increase you think you could hold insurance and claims expense flat year over year richard d o dell chief executive officer no it will be going up i mean we had a we didn t have an abnormal year in terms of severity david ross stifel analyst okay richard d o dell chief executive officer i mean the good thing for us so is down and the lower part of the tower we re in a structured program so we ve got some rate consistency in the most expensive part of the tower so the inflation we re seeing is higher up the tower that where there s less premium dollars at risk david ross stifel analyst thanks and then just turning back to the business for rick and fritz you talked about expanding i guess the indiana and phoenix facilities as you look across the rest of your business outside of the northeast expansion which is consumed a lot of time what is the growth looking like there where are you seeing opportunities what parts of the country are stronger or weaker how do you think about the rest of the portfolio richard d o dell chief executive officer yeah so david what we typically try to do is we monitor pretty closely our sort of operational door pressure where we might need either expand our footprint or replace our footprint so that s kind of an ongoing process we also have pointed out over time that in key markets we probably don t have the appropriate level of coverage so atlanta would be an example we have one terminal in atlanta it s on the southside we ll add a terminal on northside it s not going to be a 2020 opening and most likely we ll add it will start into 2021 and most likely we ll be replacing our memphis facility this year and that s kind of a normal course we see an opportunity to expand that footprint drive some efficiency particularly around break operation there so ongoing i mean we the northeast if you look at size grows certainly that s something to highlight but we also think that if you look at our legacy geography there are areas in which we can add incremental capacity in the market we can better service our customers and that s kind of throughout the geography david ross stifel analyst excellent thank you operator our next question comes from jason seidl with cowen and company jason seidl cowen and company analyst thanks operator good morning everybody i wanted to circle back to your january trends obviously pretty good numbers you mentioned they were up against easier comps could you remind us how the comps are looking versus 19 for both tonnage and shipments please douglas col vice president and chief financial officer sure so to walk through the quarter i mean shipments in the first quarter last year were just about flat down 0 1 and tonnage on the weight per shipment declines was down 3 5 in the first quarter and moving into q2 ship yeah jason seidl cowen and company analyst doug on a monthly basis though douglas col vice president and chief financial officer okay january shipments a year ago were down 0 1 february shipments were down 1 5 and march shipments were up 1 5 and if we re talking about tonnage tonnage was down 2 9 last january down 3 2 in february and down 4 4 in march jason seidl cowen and company analyst okay that gives us that gives me a good sense of what to expect as i look at the model here obviously your tax rates moved around you had some good news at the end of the year in both 19 and 20 for some tax credits what should we be modeling for 2020 and beyond douglas col vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think we ll walk into 2020 kind of expecting what we did in 2019 i think we re using about a 23 5 rate this year last year with the fuel tax credit the full year ended up coming in at 22 5 but i think it s right to model at 23 5 richard d o dell chief executive officer for the full year jason seidl cowen and company analyst okay for the full year okay that s what i had already also a little bit more conceptually looking at sort of the bigger picture obviously your expansion has been going very well within the northeast big credit to you guys on that but it has been a drag on the earnings is it right to sort of look at that and as we assume it to continue to grow at above normal market paces that you re going to get a swing in earnings potentially of upwards to a 1 a share from the money that you lost the money that you could get out of the northeast douglas col vice president and chief financial officer i m not sure of all your the eps math there but i mean you ll remember beginning 2q we ve just gotten to a little bit better than breakeven in the northeast and then we went in late in a bunch of new terminals in the second half so i m not sure the starting point that you re using to build up the potential accretion but we certainly made all these investments with a long term horizon in mind we re trying to optimize not 2019 or the first half of 2020 earnings we would open six terminals since the middle of last september but maybe offline we can go through the cadence a little bit or i m not sure if that is jason seidl cowen and company analyst sure yeah and i was just assuming a modest loss on the 280 million and then sort of get growing that a little bit in the out years and then coming to an or more in line of what you re looking forward for the whole company and then looking at the differential but we can go offline we don t need to do that now i appreciate the time as always guys douglas col vice president and chief financial officer i would just add there jason what we do know about the northeast is we don t see an impediment that couldn t get to the or trend that you see for the entire the balance of the business right so that we think that continues to be a great opportunity for us so we get our representative share in that market then i think you put that or on it i think it s pretty interesting for us jason seidl cowen and company analyst yeah i would agree gentlemen thank you very much richard d o dell chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from stephanie benjamin with suntrust stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst hi good morning thanks for the question richard d o dell chief executive officer hi sorry stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst i would good morning i wanted to talk a little bit on the pricing side maybe you can talk a little bit about what you ve been doing internally and just from you not only a data analytics side but also pricing s really continue to focus on that so just so conversations that you re having go forward you can continue to see nice yields and improvement so any kind of color there that we can kind of we can receive would be helpful thanks richard d o dell chief executive officer sure thanks stephanie i mean our cadence or drive in this area is really about continuing to refine our analytics around understanding what the cost drivers in the business are with the inflation is related to that what the as we expand the company our linehaul network evolves into being a in time a 48 state linehaul network we got to understand exactly how those what the cost drivers are in that network and if you do that then you got an opportunity to really effectively price to get the returns that we d like to get identifying that it s a further refinement of what we always do which is identifying that freight within a customer s book of business that makes sense in our network and as we continue to refine and drive our analytics we have the opportunity to balance that as we evolve our cost structure around being a national carrier and then we price accordingly and quite frankly is our quality has continued to evolve improve over time both on time and our claims ratio being very very competitive that gives us the opportunity to continue to drive those pricing decisions that national footprint also allows us to be in a position where we can bid on more freight or have the opportunity to pursue more of it we re not leveraged out because we don t have to service the customer might want so it s a combination of all those things and i know those are things that we ve highlighted over time but quite frankly in this at this stage it s really about continuing to drive the sort of incremental analytics to get that find that freight the world s best in our network stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst and i guess just a follow up on that and specifically focusing on the analytics is that something that has been more of a recent initiative or a big step up in the last year in 2019 or how could we frame maybe what innings we re at in terms of that it really starts to see some returns thanks frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yeah i think it s been an ongoing process for us over several years i think one of the things that i highlighted earlier which i think is pretty exciting is that as we ve invested in technology around our cost if you will our operational cost around better planning and dock operation and linehaul planning those are opportunities for us to better grasp what the cost drivers are and optimize that cost so we can be pricing most competitively and with the best margins so i think as we continue to enhance those sort of data analytics over time that gives us the opportunity to drive margins stephanie benjamin suntrust analyst all right well thanks again for the time frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer thank you operator our next question comes from tyler brown with raymond james tyler brown raymond james analyst hey good morning guys richard d o dell chief executive officer hi tyler tyler brown raymond james analyst hey rick i think you mentioned your dock and p d productivity was up in 19 can you quantify that and just to be clear are you speaking to the entire network or is that just the legacy piece richard d o dell chief executive officer no the entire network was up year over year just modestly but it s in the 1 to 2 range tyler brown raymond james analyst okay if you were to parse out say those 18 northeastern facilities how far behind are they in terms of labor productivity where you would maybe want them to get steady state richard d o dell chief executive officer the it s more than 10 below the company average yeah tyler brown raymond james analyst okay so a lot of opportunity there so maybe kind of putting that together maybe for doug or fritz but i think you mentioned q4 headcount was up say 5 in here in q4 but as you saturate those facilities you roll technology in and i know it s going to be a bit volume dependent but do you feel that there is latent labor capacity across the network do you think you can grow headcount at a lower rate than say shipments douglas col vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would think so particularly in the northeast right so in a in those markets in many cases we re staffed to provide service rather than be most productive if that makes sense right so in our p d operations aren t at capacity so i think if there is as we grow into that market particularly the newest terminals there is a real opportunity there for us to drive some incremental improvements and if you think about in total we ve mentioned that the northeast is a fully allocated or that s a drag and if you just compare that to the rest of the company for full year you d say there is an opportunity to really drive some productivity there around those operations frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer and i would just comment it s not just in the city and the dock because we re running linehaul schedules with parcels for service soon as you build density then you run your parcels are smaller percentage to the whole tyler brown raymond james analyst okay that makes sense but do you feel that even in the legacy piece that there is still call it that latent labor opportunity as well frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer yes tyler brown raymond james analyst call it dock all three aspects i guess frederick holzgrefe president and chief operating officer i would agree yes douglas col vice president and chief financial officer correct tyler brown raymond james analyst okay thank you guys douglas col vice president and chief financial officer sure operator that will conclude our question and answer session i will now turn the conference back over to mr doug col for closing remarks douglas col vice president and chief financial officer well thank you everybody for joining us on the call and we ll get through winter and into the stronger month of the year we look forward to chatting again after q1 thank you operator duration 46 minutes call

defined within the non gaap financial measures described below any non gaap financial measures presented are reconciled to their respective gaap equivalents management believes these non gaap financial measures are useful in assessing the ongoing operational profitability of the company s business segments and therefore allow shareholders better visibility into the company s underlying operations see non gaap financial measures described below filtration fluid flow segment renamed with the addition of globe composite llc globe in q4 2019 and in conjunction with the divestiture of

contributions from pti crissair and vacco test sales increased nominally as a result of the quarterly timing on large project milestones and usg sales decreased 3 million as a result of the timing of product deliveries sg a expenses increased in q1 2020 as a result of higher spending on r d new product development additional sales commissions normal cost of living adjustments and the addition of globe entered orders were 220 million in q1 2020 book to bill of 1 28x an increase of 23 percent over q1 2019 orders of 179 million resulting in an ending backlog of 500 million at december 31 2019 an

payments related to the sale of the technical packaging segment to be approximately 26 million q1 2020 net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of 3 million coupled with the cash proceeds from the sale of the technical packaging segment resulted in 53 million of net debt outstanding total borrowings less cash on hand at december 31 2019 with a 0 92x leverage ratio operating cash flow for q1 2020 was negatively impacted by the timing of cash receipts between december 2019 and january 2020 chairman s commentary q1 2020 vic richey chairman and chief executive officer commented the clear highlight of q1 2020 is that we completed the sale of our technical packaging segment at the end of december and received approximately 190 million while recording a large gain on the sale all while delivering operating results 3 cents above the top end of our guidance for adjusted eps we received the cash from the divestiture on the last day of the quarter and the proceeds were used to pay down a substantial portion of our outstanding debt and to reduce our leverage ratio we plan to use this additional liquidity and our substantial debt capacity to fund future acquisitions and grow our business as we continue to evaluate a robust pipeline of m a opportunities and expect to add to our current portfolio during 2020 on the operational side we delivered solid results during the quarter as we exceeded our sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps targets set at the start of the year our test and a d businesses contributed to our enhanced performance as both segments results exceeded their targets and more than offset the timing related sales and adjusted ebitda shortfall noted in usg globe continues to deliver results above expectations and its outlook appears to be gaining momentum such that we now believe this business may provide future contributions greater than our forecast at the time of acquisition recent new wins for additional content on navy submarines both virginia and columbia class give me confidence that globe s growth prospects may materialize sooner than expected we improved our consolidated q1 2020 adjusted ebitda by 5 percent and maintained our margins above 16 percent despite the lower contribution from our highest margin segment our entered orders were strong as we booked 220 million of new business and grew our backlog from the start of the year by 11 percent to 500 million which sets us up nicely for our projected growth over the remainder of the year the doble headquarters relocation was completed in november and i m thrilled with the feedback from our staff as to how smooth the integration went and how energized everyone is to be in the new location i m certain this move will further enhance our operational efficiency and effectiveness the recent news surrounding the suspended production of the 737max creates some headwind for us over the next few months until production resumes but given that our oem sales content on that platform is relatively modest we believe we can absorb the earnings impact over the remainder of the year as we have well defined opportunities across the a d segment to mitigate this shortfall we plan to build on the successes of q1 and expect to continue benefitting from our disciplined operating culture throughout 2020 by narrowing our focus and simplifying the business with the recent divestiture coupled with our solid market positions and tangible growth opportunities across the company i have a favorable view of the future with our goal remaining unchanged to increase long term shareholder value dividend payment the next quarterly cash dividend of 0 08 per share will be paid on april 17 2020 to stockholders of record on april 2 2020 business outlook 20 20 adjusted basis the technical packaging business segment s results of operations gain on sale balance sheet and cash flows are reported as discontinued operations and therefore are excluded from the following discussion as previously described management plans to use a portion of the net proceeds during 2020 to fully fund terminate and annuitize the defined benefit pension plan currently maintained by the company annuitizing this non strategic liability through an insurance company will eliminate both equity market risk and interest rate volatility thereby reducing our costs and eliminating future cash payments the defined benefit plan was frozen in 2003 and no additional benefits have been accrued since that date the accounting impact of terminating and annuitizing the pension will also be excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps management continues to see meaningful net sales and adjusted ebitda growth across each of the company s business segments and anticipates growth rates in 2020 and beyond that will generally exceed the broader industrial market the growth described below is expected to be enhanced by additional m a contributions during the year management s expectations for growth in 2020 compared to 2019 are consistent with the details outlined in the november 19 2019 release the highlights are summarized here management

this year will be a time when top management of companies around the world will stop thinking and make serious evaluations starting with geopolitical tensions that the atlantic alliance s american and european wings have ignored due to either impotence or other interests severe uncertainties triggered by the global trade wars led by the u s are forcing millions of companies on a global scale to seek new markets and new supply chains to sell worldwide the companies that saw the asia pacific countries as the most important supply partner for a long time are now seriously questioning dependency on a single geography the global ceo survey published by pricewaterhousecoopers pwc one of the world s well known management consultancy and audit firms points out that ceos who put forward a highly optimistic expectation for the growth performance of the world economy in 2018 today have moved toward pessimism for 2020 and beyond while the highest pessimism is showing itself in north america and western europe a relatively low pessimism is observed in the central and eastern european countries including turkey and russia and in the asia pacific region globally ceos expectations for an increase in corporate returns and real sector confidence in a medium term of three years were twice the highest in 2011 and 2017 at 51 percent this rate fell to 34 percent in 2020 next year it is estimated to decline to 27 percent excessive regulations by governments political uncertainties inadequacy in the company s core skills trade disputes and cyberattacks were perceived as the top five threat topics in 2019 in 2020 ceos kept over regulation by governments in first place moved trade disputes from fourth place to second uncertainty toward the growth of the world economy from the 12th to third place and cyberattacks from fifth to fourth place on a global scale ceos do not perceive uncertainties in taxes excessive fluctuations in exchange rates and parity changes in consumer trends and protectionist inclinations among countries as priority risk topics among the most fundamental 15 threats in north america cyberattacks in western central and eastern europe excessive regulation of governments in latin america populism in asia pacific trade disputes in africa political uncertainties and in the middle east geopolitical uncertainties are at the top of the list in the asia pacific africa latin america and the middle east who represent a large part of the world s population and economy uncertainty in economic growth is the second most important threat and risk topic globally the ceos pessimistic perception and threat perception toward growth also adversely affect investment tendencies in order for 2020 to be the year of an investment move it will be necessary to pave the way for positive developments that will disperse this pessimism the investment move since the 2008 global financial crisis for more than 11 years the fact that an investment move at a global scale could not be realized to help the workable population find job opportunities is making economists think this problem manifests itself in every continent from europe to america from africa to asia of course this problem is experienced in different dimensions in each country the international monetary fund imf which announced its global economic outlook report in january revised its growth forecast for 2020 once again by lowering it by 0 2 points to 3 3 imf which stated that the world economy grew by 2 9 in 2019 foresees a 3 4 global growth for 2022 imf expresses that the most critical aspect of growth worldwide is the investment move a move predominantly focused on the private sector and public infrastructure superstructure investments will also mobilize global employment imf expects that the difficulties in financing investments will be reduced due to the relatively expansionary monetary policy measures of leading central banks the imf in this context owing to improvements and possible activation in investments in turkey and the dynamism in russia raised its growth expectations for the developing europe region to 2 5 for 2020 and 2021 the growth number for this region was announced as 1 8 for 2019 for the euro area which grew by 1 2 in 2019 the imf reduced its forecast for 2020 by 0 1 to 1 3 and for 2021 to 1 4 the primary reason for the decline in imf s projection for global growth is the possible slowdown in india and similar emerging economies united nations international labor organization ilo on the other hand predicted that according to the current global economic picture 2 5 million more people will be added to the global unemployment figure in 2020 and shared that in a world where over 5 billion people above the age of 15 can work 188 million will face unemployment pointing out that 165 million people do not have adequate jobs and can only work at limited hours per week ilo also stated that these people cannot earn enough to live a dignified life it highlighted that 120 million women and men withdrew from the employment market due to disappointment or not having access to the labor market due to limitations or discrimination in ilo s report emphasizing the situation of young people between the ages of 15 24 it is stated that 267 million people in this age group do not have a job education or school diploma and this situation is described as scary although it expects the number of unemployed people in europe to decrease from 15 6 million to 15 3 million in 2020 ilo is worried that not only trade barriers and protectionism the troubling topics of the global economy will increase the number of unemployed people in the countries and regions affected by global trade wars but also that the social injustice will rise in countries such as the u s germany and the uk
sukuk explained sukuk are sharia compliant financial certificates issued by governments corporates and other entities while as an asset class they resemble conventional bonds there are some significant differences as interest is prohibited under sharia sukuk must contain an underlying transaction for example a leaseback agreement and the income that is paid to investors is generated by the underlying asset investors must also be prepared to share in both the profits and losses of an enterprise nevertheless sukuk are similar to conventional bonds in that they provide regular payments and are considered less risky than equities most investors would not buy sukuk directly due to high minimum subscriptions but invest via funds for investors with a sharia compliant investment portfolio including sukuk is a no brainer according to one fund manager this is because sukuk play the same stabilisation role that bonds do in a conventional investor s portfolio but at a time of uncertainty for the global economy and with high amounts of negative yielding debt should conventional investors consider adding sukuk to their portfolio too they certainly might be tempted based on the stellar returns for several sukuk funds last year franklin templeton s global sukuk fund returned 12 6 per cent over 2019 while emirates nbd asset management s global sukuk fund returned 11 5 per cent over the same period and al hilal global sukuk fund delivered 10 5 per cent over the 12 months through to the end of november 2019 adding global sukuk to a conventional investor s portfolio reduces that portfolio s risk however many of these funds also produced poor results in 2018 leaving their performance over a longer period more subdued franklin templeton s fund was down 1 5 per cent for 2018 for example excellent returns in 2019 are also part of a wider uplift for fixed income assets generally for example the vanguard global bond index fund the type of fixed income fund a conventional investor might have in their portfolio was up 8 4 per cent net of expenses while its benchmark bloomberg barclays global aggregate index was up 8 6 per cent riskier emerging market bonds funds delivered even better returns with the ishares jp morgan usd emerging markets bond etf producing a total return of 15 6 per cent last year balanced against a 5 7 per cent drop the previous year while the performance of sukuk markets has indeed been strong over the past few years that has to be seen in the context of how well bond markets have done in general says richard carter head of fixed interest research at quilter cheviot one of the uk s largest discretionary investment firms which has an office in dubai obviously it depends on which measure or index you take but arguably the returns have not been that different to conventional us dollar investment grade debt he adds over the past six years however the average annualised return on the dow jones sukuk index which tracks us dollar denominated investment grade sukuk is around 4 3 per cent whereas over the same period the bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond index has produced a return of around 4 1 per cent a slight tilt in favour of sukuk says angad rajpal head of fixed income at emirates nbd asset management another key performance datum is volatility sukuk have very low levels of volatility especially when compared with emerging market debt says mohieddine kronfol chief investment officer of global sukuk and mena fixed income at franklin templeton for someone who s investing in global fixed income he says it makes sense to invest in global sukuk because of the diversification benefits and defensive characteristics of the asset class the global sukuk market continues to exhibit low correlations to other fixed income sectors and obviously equity markets and even commodities like oil while also exhibiting low levels of volatility which will typically have a positive impact in the context of an overall portfolio says mr kronfol adding global sukuk to a conventional investor s portfolio reduces that portfolio s risk global sukuk have experienced less downside risk compared to major global fixed income benchmarks over the past 10 years according to franklin templeton with lower drawdowns during times of market stress apart from the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 providing downside protection for investors the growth of islamic financial institutions such as banks and takaful institutions which continue to capture market share from conventional counterparts is boosting demand for sukuk and contributing to market strength says mr kronfol strong demand creates a scarcity premium which helps protect the market against drawdown in times of market stress says samin abedi the global head of portfolio management at wahed invest a us robo advisory which also has a presence in the uae emirates nbd s mr rajpal agrees historically sukuk instruments have benefited from very strong scarcity value he says some of that has faded especially in relation to sovereigns but i would say that still pretty much exists for corporates so there s still a lot of scarcity value for sukuk however mr carter suggests the lower volatility may be partly due to less active trading in sukuk where investors tend to have a buy and hold approach with most sukuk issued in muslim majority countries it means interested investors will be adding exposure to a specific geography typically the middle east or countries in south east asia including malaysia and indonesia from a conventional investor perspective sukuk are similar to emerging market em debt says mr carter though most em fixed income funds will have a broader exposure across asia latin america and eastern europe that has not necessarily always been a good thing because middle eastern bonds have performed quite well of late despite political tensions while countries like argentina have done poorly he says emerging market funds may also have more exposure to currency risk whereas sukuk funds are generally dollar based while yields in em funds tend to be higher due to additional sovereign and credit risk downsides conventional investors may see when considering sukuk funds is that they typically have to go invest through actively managed funds which can come with higher costs than passive index funds the choice of sukuk funds in reality is fairly limited and the number of issuers in those funds is quite small says mr carter conventional investors have a massive choice of funds even if they are only looking at us dollar investment grade credit the etf market is also highly developed and attractively priced the sharia compliant robo adviser wahed invest offers a relatively low cost option with sukuk funds included in its investor portfolios its fees range from 0 5 per cent to 0 1 per cent per year depending on how much you invest steve cronin founder of the online financial community deadsimplesaving com an independent community for financial education in the uae says he sees no reason for a non muslim investor to invest in sukuk they are very concentrated in emerging markets such as the gcc and south east asia and typically corporate backed he says it s much better for most investors to take their risk in equities and then have an allocation to shorter term government bonds for downside protection during a correction or crash the narrow breadth of the market is the main downside for conventional investors says mr carter total sukuk issuance in globally 2019 were worth 162bn according to research from s p ratings while the total issuance of bonds in the us market alone was around 8 trillion according to data from the securities industry and financial markets association sifma the number of issuers is fairly limited and concentrated in countries like the uae indonesia and saudi arabia says mr carter while many of the issuers have solid credit ratings they are not especially well known companies in a global context even if an investor sees value in adding sukuk to their portfolio given the recent strong returns from many funds it s worth questioning whether now is a good time to allocate to sukuk or fixed income after all chasing returns is one of the most basic mistakes an investor can make there is good reason to be wary of fixed income markets at the moment given the extremely strong returns that they have enjoyed says mr carter this performance has been driven by concerns over trump s trade war with china plus interest rate cuts from the federal reserve however higher quality fixed income remains an important diversifier against equity risk in portfolios and should continue to perform well if the global economy slows he adds
