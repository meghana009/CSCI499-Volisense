up the line for your questions as you saw in our earnings release this morning we concluded our third quarter with continued net sales momentum we grew 2 4 in the quarter which included core business growth of 2 9 adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations in the third quarter declined 4 year over year in line with our expectations and reflecting the factors we highlighted in our last earnings call these factors include the concentration of incremental marketing spend in the third quarter to support our leadership brands and match our seasonality the impact initially of tariffs ahead of mitigation measures we have taken and some mix effects advertisement advertisement leadership brands and online sales led the way this quarter leadership brands grew net sales 4 9 in the quarter and online sales grew 6 now accounting for 18 of the total sales of the company our seven leadership brands are now approximately 80 of our sales the strategic choices we are making around investment in digital marketing and online support for our leadership brands are critical and are paying off with sales growth market share gains for some and improvements at all touch points of the consumer journey by investing in more and better content and using increasingly sophisticated marketing strategies we are creating an ever stronger presence online many studies confirm consumers spend more and more time surfing searching socializing and shopping on digital devices as a consumer centric company we are focused on ensuring our brands and products stay prominent in the hearts the minds and the checkout carts of consumers around the world and even as we grow faster online than we do in brick and mortar in store support remains a key investment for us in order to command the shelf stay competitive on price and help customers maintain their growing e commerce business at the end of the day we re focused on remaining top of mind wherever consumers spend their time and their money consumer demand for our products remains strong in the us where the majority of our sales occur more households have additional discretionary income with growing employment and labor participation rates wage growth and generally speaking lower taxes we see this reflected where we have access to point of sale and to market share data advertisement advertisement outside the us we have seen pressure on chinese consumers particularly online as the rapid growth of their economy slows and uncertainty from the trade war touches all shores even as we begin rebalancing our supply chain we remain confident in china as a long term strategic source of goods and a growth vector for helen of troy we see its growing middle class increasing childbirth rate and new household formation as key growth drivers for our brands and inspiration for new products the whole asia region remains a top priority for us as we continue to build out our branded presence in these markets as we balance the needs to manage the costs of the trade war some foreign exchange headwinds and continued investment in the most promising opportunities for our leadership brands we have been raising prices focusing primarily on products impacted by higher tariffs overall our conversations with customers about pricing have been constructive and we believe we ll successfully mitigate a significant portion of higher costs through pricing we also are pursuing productivity initiatives internally and with our suppliers leveraging changes in commodity costs and foreign exchange and working toward a new sourcing balance between china the americas and europe while retail price points have been relatively stable for years retailers will likely pass on some of the increases testing consumers price sensitivity turning to our strategic progress i would like to report key steps since our last earnings call toward further improving our portfolio and asset efficiency we put our strong cash flow and capital allocation strategy to work in the third quarter we returned 100 million to shareholders through the repurchase of just over 800 000 shares of our stock we used our remaining free cash flow to reduce helen of troy s leverage ratio to 1 4 times keeping us in a strong financial position to make additional acquisition advertisement advertisement with the transformation plan continuing to strengthen our shared services platform we have never been better prepared operationally to add new businesses to our portfolio we nevertheless remain highly selective as we look for the right assets to augment our leadership brands build out our regional footprint and leverage our scale project refuel is also progressing as expected and continues to target annualized savings of approximately 8 million to 10 million over the duration of the plan we are reinvesting some of this and dropping some to strengthen the bottom line in beauty the reinvestment focus on critical areas such as developing new products new appliance products attracting outside new talent and dialing up our marketing support especially online turning now to our business segments housewares delivered another excellent quarter with net sales increased by 11 4 standout categories during the quarter were specialty hydration and coffee collections cooking prep and kitchen organization as discussed previously we continued to make incremental marketing investments to build out digital content that engages consumers on the outstanding innovation design and performance at oxo and also hydro flask products all with a sharp eye on roi and the challenging competitive environment hydro flask continues to win third party data confirms the brand continues to hold the number one market share position in the insulated metal water bottle segment and has grown share significantly over the past 12 months hydro flask continues to enjoy excellent point of sale performance across the diverse distribution channels we track which include npd ssi active lifestyle industry natural foods online and also in specific customers advertisement advertisement stronger in store presentations across bottles and accessories we started over the holidays are showing early encouraging results we are seeing healthy consumer takeaway with notable complementary sales from accessories hydro flask also continues to earn new distribution and expand its geographic footprint in health home our largest and our most global business net sales decreased 0 7 primarily due to a drag of 0 6 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange the core business was essentially flat year over year versus the strong third quarter performance last year when we benefited from new product launches and international distribution gains domestically we further expanded distribution in health home and saw growth in some seasonal categories another devastating wildfire season on the west coast struck in november late in the quarter leading to a modest year over year sales increase for our market leading honeywell air purifiers as a reminder in october of last year the west coast also felt the impact of a heavy fire season which increased air purifier sales in the year ago base also in the base is last year s historic thomas fire which struck during our fourth quarter reflecting on the current cough cold and flu season we ve experienced a more normal start and there are currently no indications of a repeat of last year s particularly high incidence of flu the exact timing and duration of the season for each symptom can vary but most types of respiratory illness including flu usually begin to peak between december and february and they wind down by early spring this season s illness rates so far are following this pattern as well with increased incidents in recent weeks of symptoms such as fever cough and congestion these correlate very strongly with consumer purchases of our thermometers humidifiers and inhalants under the vicks and braun names the specific impact on our shipments depends on customer inventories stocking patterns and replenishment rates as their upfront purchases via direct import or from our warehouses sell through given the pattern so far this year our outlook continues to assume a normal season for the balance of fiscal 2019 advertisement advertisement now turning to beauty net sales decreased 3 in the quarter we are seeing some improvements from our strategic efforts to stabilize appliances while down slightly in the quarter following the discontinuation of certain brands and products appliances benefited from new products international sales and growth in the online channel we are also growing appliance share online the revlon volumizers are particularly hot seller serving as a great example of consumer centric innovation at work it delivers on the consumer need for speed styling and drying in one convenient time saving product it consistently earns four to five star reviews and has garnered considerable attention in the media and online as an it item looking at what we ve accomplished so far this fiscal year to date we have quite a lot to be proud of the third quarter built on a very strong first half on a full year basis we expect to show solid growth even in the face of a tough compare to last year s especially strong cough cold and flu season nine months in we ve returned value to shareholders through the repurchase of over 1 2 million shares while simultaneously lowering leverage we remain in a strong position to deploy capital toward further acquisition we now expect fiscal 2019 to deliver net sales growth of 3 8 to 4 8 versus fiscal 2018 which was also a strong sales growth year at 5 9 on the bottom line we have raised our adjusted eps for fiscal 2019 to 7 70 to 7 95 per share reflecting the most recent share repurchase and that represents growth of 6 4 to 9 8 versus fiscal 2018 advertisement advertisement as we look forward to fiscal 2020 which begins this march we have made our strategic choices for a second phase of helen of troy s transformation this next phase is designed to build on the successes of the past five years we will focus on driving further improvements to our current businesses expand our geographic footprint our global shared services will advance and the overall strength of our organization as well we will also seek to add to our leadership brand portfolio through further acquisition we believe we have the balance sheet the capabilities the culture and the passionate owner minded people to take our transformation to the next level we look forward to sharing more during our next investor day which is currently planned for late spring with that i will now turn the call over to brian brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer thank you julien good morning everyone before discussing the quarter in more detail i d like to start with a few broad points first my comments today will be regarding our results from continuing operations for the third quarter of both fiscal 2019 and 2018 unless otherwise indicated second during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard as a result we have reclassified certain expenses from sg a to reduction of net sales revenue corresponding amounts in the prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation so that both periods are comparable please see the related table and footnotes in the accompanying press release for further information finally tariff increases began to impact our cost of goods sold during the third quarter as expected while we have implemented pricing actions and other mitigation measures the both of these actions did not become materially effective in the third quarter our pricing actions will begin to provide a meaningful offset to the tariffs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and we expect them to be effectively completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 this is due to the negotiation and notice periods involved in taking pricing actions the company is targeting to offset as much of the tariff gross profit dollar impact as possible however a 25 tariff impact on costs translates to 11 to 13 increase on the price of product to retailers as such even if we keep ourselves whole in gross dollars gross profit margin is expected to decline further although the pricing actions are intended to keep us whole in terms of gross profit dollars there is no guarantee that they won t reduce retail consumption or customer orders in the short term we have not resolved product pricing with one key retailer in two product categories and we are currently not shipping these particular items to this one customer while we expect some disruption from pricing actions in the short term including the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we believe we re making the right choices for the long term health of our business and that our products continue to offer attractive value propositions at the higher prices now turning to a review of the quarter we posted adjusted diluted eps at the midpoint of our stated range of flat to down 8 compared to the same period last year which was in line with our expectations as we highlighted on our second quarter call this is largely due to the planned increase in marketing spending in fiscal 2019 coupled with the concentration of spending in the third quarter along with the tariff increases we began to realize in the third quarter turning to a more detailed review consolidated sales revenue was 431 1 million a 2 4 increase over the prior year core business revenue grew 2 9 revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in brick and mortar sales in our housewares segment and growth in consolidated online sales sales in the online channel grew approximately 6 year over year to comprise approximately 18 of our consolidated net sales in the third quarter the sequential decline in online sales growth rate was primarily due to a deceleration of growth in our china e commerce business and a corresponding build up of inventory in the channel primarily impacting health home and a reduction in inventory levels by a key online retailer primarily impacting housewares online sell through in housewares continues to be healthy and is growing double digits leadership brand sales grew approximately 4 9 our leadership brand sales now represent approximately 80 of our consolidated net sales for the quarter compared to approximately 78 for the same period last year housewares net sales increased 11 4 reflecting point of sale strength and incremental distribution with existing domestic customers and increase in online sales and new product introductions health home net sales decreased 0 7 with the decline primarily due to the unfavorable impact from net foreign currency fluctuations of 1 1 million or 0 6 the core business within health home posted a slight decline of 0 2 reflecting lower online sales and the unfavorable comparative impact from international distribution gains new product introductions and a strong cough cold flu season in the prior year these factors were partially offset by strong seasonal category growth in gains in distribution and shelf space with existing domestic customers as julien mentioned the segment did see strong point of sale activity in the air category related to recent wildfires however it was largely comparable to the activity in the same period last year beauty net sales decreased 3 primarily due to a decline in the personal care category and the discontinuation of certain brands and products these factors more than offset continued growth in the online channel new product introductions in the retail appliance category and an increase in international sales segment net sales were unfavorably impacted by net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 0 6 million or 0 6 consolidated gross profit margin was 42 2 compared to 42 3 for the same period last year the 0 1 percentage point decrease is primarily due to less favorable product mix and the impact of tariff increases partially offset by margin lift from growth in our leadership brands sg a was 28 of net sales compared to 26 1 for the same period last year the 1 9 percentage point increase is primarily due to higher advertising expense increased freight costs increased share based compensation expense and higher product claim expense these factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements the favorable comparative impact of restructuring charges in the same period last year and lower amortization expense the primary driver of higher share based compensation expense in the quarter was due to the issuance of transformation shares to every helen of troy associate which we highlighted on our last earnings call these transformation shares vest over a three year period gaap operating income was 61 3 million or 14 2 of net sales this compares to 67 3 million or 16 of net sales in the same period last year which included restructuring charges of 1 1 million adjusted operating income was 70 6 million or 16 4 of net sales compared to 77 6 million or 18 4 of net sales the 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects higher advertising expense the impact of tariff increases and higher freight expense these factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements lower amortization and the favorable margin impact from leadership brand growth turning now to adjusted operating margin by segment housewares adjusted operating margin was 22 8 compared to 24 7 the 1 9 percentage point decrease primarily reflects higher advertising expense higher annual incentive compensation expense related to current year performance higher freight expense and higher rent expense related to previously announced new office space these factors were partially offset by the margin impact of more favorable a more favorable product and channel mix and increased operating leverage from net sales growth health home adjusted operating margin was 13 compared to 17 the 4 percentage point decrease primarily reflects higher advertising expense increased promotional spending and trade support with retail customers the impact of tariff increases the margin impact of a less favorable product and channel mix and higher personnel expense these factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements beauty adjusted operating margin was 13 5 compared to 13 3 the 0 2 percentage point increase primarily reflects lower amortization and personnel cost savings from project refuel these factors were partially offset by higher advertising and higher freight expense our effective tax rate was 6 9 compared to 8 2 the same period last year the decrease is due to shifts in the mix of taxable income across our tax jurisdictions income from continuing operations was 54 3 million or 2 06 per diluted share this compares to 58 6 million or 2 15 per diluted share in the same period last year which included after tax restructuring charges of 0 04 a share non gaap adjusted income from continuing operations was 63 2 million or 2 40 per diluted share compared to 68 1 million or 2 50 per diluted share the 4 decrease in adjusted diluted eps primarily reflects higher advertising expense the impact of tariff increases and higher freight expense partially offset by better operating leverage the margin left from leadership brand growth lower interest expense lower tax expense and the impact of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding loss from discontinued operations was 4 9 million compared to a loss of 89 1 million in the same period last year the loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflects the impact of the settlement of the supplemental payment amount associated with the sale of healthy directions during the quarter we ve reduced the estimated value of the supplemental payment to 10 8 million and recorded an after tax charge of 4 4 million the amount was adjusted based on the settlement with respect to the calculation of the performance of healthy directions through february 28 2018 during the quarter we also recorded an after tax charge of 0 5 million resulting from the resolution of certain contingencies the loss in the same quarter last year primarily reflects after tax impairment charges recorded prior to the divestiture now moving on to our financial position accounts receivable turnover increased to 69 4 days compared to 65 4 days in the same period last year inventory was 300 6 million compared to 278 1 million at the same time last year inventory turnover improved to 3 4 times compared to 2 8 times in the prior year period net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased 6 6 million to 109 5 million the increase was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations higher share based compensation and an increase in cash provided from accounts payable these factors were partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory and a dispute settlement payment of 15 million made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 total short and long term debt decreased 86 5 million to 339 7 million compared to 426 2 million at the end of the third quarter last year we ended the third quarter with the leverage ratio of 1 4 times compared to 1 8 times as previously reported at the end of the third quarter last year we were able to continue to delever wealth while also repurchasing almost 814 000 shares of our common stock for 100 million on an average price of less than 123 per share we are pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date which we believe keep us on track to deliver another strong year of revenue and adjusted diluted eps growth for fiscal 2019 we now expect consolidated net sales revenue in the range of 1 535 billion to 1 55 billion which implies consolidated sales growth of 3 8 to 4 8 our sales outlook now also includes the following items which together account for the 10 million decline in the high end of our outlook and primarily impact the health home segment an expected unfavorable impact from pricing actions that have not been resolved with the key customer in two of our product categories and a deceleration of growth in china with a corresponding buildup of inventory in the channel and the impact that we believe trade tensions are having on both the us and chinese consumers we are still very optimistic about our prospects in china and opportunity for growth in the region and continue to consider it to be a key strategic initiative for the company going forward our net sales outlook continues to assume the severity of the cough cold flu season will be in line with historical averages which unfavorably impacts the full year comparisons to fiscal 2018 by 1 1 our net sales outlook also assumes that december 2018 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the remainder of the year we have updated our segment growth rate expectations for the full fiscal year and now expect an increase in housewares net sales growth to 11 to 13 health home net sales growth of 2 to 4 including an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 3 from the average cough cold flu assumption and beauty net sales declined in the low to mid single digits which remains the same despite the decline in the high end of our net sales outlook range we are increasing our eps outlook to reflect the lower share count from open market repurchases made during the quarter we now expect consolidated gaap diluted eps from continuing operations of 6 35 to 6 51 and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations in the range of 7 70 to 7 95 based on an estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 26 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 our eps outlook continues to include an increase in growth investments for fiscal 2019 in the range of 18 to 22 year over year as we spend into the strength of the current year support new product launches and accelerate the development of digital assets and investment in digital marketing to drive future growth our outlook also includes the impact of expected commodity and freight inflation on our cost of goods sold as well as the expected impact of tariff changes in their current form while we currently anticipate achieving our fiscal 2019 revised full year outlook the current us china trade environment is certainly a concern and could provide a meaningful headwind next fiscal year if we ultimately realize the full year impact of tariff changes in their current form looking at our expectations for tax we now expect to report gaap effective tax rate range of 7 3 to 8 4 and an adjusted effective tax rate range of 6 9 to 7 7 for the full fiscal year 2019 please refer to the schedule entitled effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate in the tables to the press release our outlook for diluted eps from continuing operations assumes that december 2018 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the remainder of the fiscal year other eps assumptions are consistent with our previous guidance the likelihood and potential impact of any fiscal 2019 acquisitions or additional divestitures future asset impairment charges future foreign currency fluctuations or further share repurchases are unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated therefore they are not included in the company s sales and earnings outlook and now i d like to turn it back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we ll take our first question from bob labick of cjs securities go ahead sir your line is open bob labick cjs securities analyst good morning and happy new year julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah good morning bob happy new year bob labick cjs securities analyst thanks i wanted to start with two quick kind of clarifications and i ll ask one thematic one and i ll hop back in queue you mentioned a pricing dispute with one customer in two categories can you tell us what percentage of sales are impacted there or really any kind of clarification is this a normal occurrence or what s kind of going on there julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah let me start here and brian may have more to say pricing is a lumpy process it s easy to say in a conference room or a business meeting we re ph going to take some pricing and that said in these categories in our industry there hasn t been pricing action in years so to go into the market and take pricing is a process customers understand it i think consumers understand about the trade war and we ve been largely successful in fact it s just one customer and it s only in two of the 10 or 11 categories we trade in health home and even in that one customer i think eight or nine of the categories have already been accepted and we re shipping as normal brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer while we didn t take price increases in all categories because not all categories were impacted by the tariff but we were successful in getting price increases in all but two of the categories that were impacted by tariffs julien r mininberg chief executive officer director correct and in housewares we ve also raised prices on the tariff affected categories and have not had significant concerns either in this one customer we re holding our ground we re doing the right thing we re doing the right thing for the brand we re doing the right thing in the marketplace and we ve done right with the other customers and frankly so have they so this is the right move in terms of dimensionalizing you heard brian say that the primary driver of our small change to the upper end only of our guidance on sales that 10 million is primarily due to this item and so that gets you a sense of dimension brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer well so it s due to a combination of this and the slowdown in china e commerce so if you want to think 50 50 you re probably not going to be that far off but we re not going to give specific guidance but that could hopefully help you dimensionalize it julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah and so the price so i make sure that on the public call and while we re officially on record that there s absolutely no misunderstanding of any kind our pricing actions so far have been successful we have been able to take pricing in categories that traditionally do not have price increases as part of their normal cycle that s a statement measured in years and we have been able to take pricing with the vast majority of our customers in the vast majority of affected categories we are lowering the guidance to deal with those two items that brian is talking about this is one of them and we re transparent we want you to know and my last comment on it is pricing is a lumpy process it is not the kind of thing that you just send out a note saying here s our new price when shall we ship you with the new higher prices what s your order please customers want to have a discussion they want to push back they want to see the math they want to have a meeting they want to see what competitors do they want to see what their alternatives are and this is a marketplace and in marketplaces things have a way of working out but it doesn t just go from one day to the next brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer well and i d like just to add one thing with respect to the doing the right thing part imagine if you are talking to retail customer a and they found out that retail customer b didn t have to take a price increase the retail customer a wouldn t be very happy but it s really the only choice is to stick to our position and take stick hold to our ground and take the pricing even if it s a little bit lumpy and a little bit disruptive to sales in the short term we believe that this is a short term item and that in the long run will end up in a good place on pricing and profitability julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah and we already are in most of the customers and most of the categories brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer right bob labick cjs securities analyst okay super thank you for that clarity and then just maybe two seconds on the chinese e commerce issues going on here it sounds like just maybe some inventory in the channel could you tell us really what you re selling in there what categories if you can and then the bigger question i really want to ask is international has become a bigger theme for you over the last several quarters can you talk a little bit about how big the opportunity is and maybe how you view that opportunity now versus a few years ago and what s different and where the growth will come in that area julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah two great questions first to clarify on the chinese on the e commerce e commerce is an important part of the chinese market china is an important part of asia and asia is a winning area for us we don t disclose to asia as a specific category or by specific breakout but i will just tell everyone in the public call here that we re talking about thermometers is the primary driver in china and it s primarily online we ve been tremendously successful and if you ve listened us over the last couple of years really not just quarters we ve frequently highlighted success in china and asia and online and in thermometers what s happening here is there is some slowdown and as a result there s an inventory buildup in the category that we ll have to play through prices are also sorting themselves out and in china in general there s just a bit of slowdown of some pretty heady growth that 6 8 9 kind of numbers that have been going on for years in china are believed to be coming down we re seeing a little bit of that but you have to see the underlying picture there s roughly 16 million births a year in china that s a growing number that s roughly 4 times the number of births in the united states every single year and those babies go into households many of them newly formed those households in a rising middle class with more discretionary income and they want to do right for their families just like anybody else in the world they want the best and when it comes to a thermometer it s well known that the braun products are exceptionally capable they re generally better than any other here thermometers available on the market they re not made in china and chinese consumers tend to favor that especially for healthcare products and we have been the market leader so it s just great to see to see that slow down a little and a little inventory stack up that s what we re talking about and if you take that 10 million that i mentioned that we mentioned in our guidance and that split that brian alluded to you can get a little sense of the of the size here and as it pertains to asia broadly and international sorry asia in general and international broadly international is a highly underdeveloped part of helen of troy s business during phase one of the transformation which is the last five years we ve focused more on domestic than we have international and all of the key themes that you ve heard me talk about at length over the last few years on helen of troy have been playing through with some pretty good success we re now at a point of development where we can export more of that success in terms of our business model we re much better integrated and operationally capable than we have ever been before the shared services platform is increasingly standardized and synchronized and the back offices around the world are on pretty standard processes the front of the house is getting better and better with the digital marketing and our leadership brand strategy has been paying dividends so to do more of that in places where we re highly underdeveloped makes all the sense in the world to us and asia and europe are two clear and obvious focus areas we have good infrastructure we have the right brands the right consumer markets like the chinese thing i just described most of the european markets we re active in but frankly could have a bigger footprint so this is an area where we would like to see action in the future and in the second phase of the transformation that i alluded to in my comments we re very excited about our international prospects bob labick cjs securities analyst all right super thank you so much julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you bet bob operator we will now take our next question from chris carey of bank of america please go ahead chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning julien r mininberg chief executive officer director good morning chris chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i know we re early days right and it sounds like we re going to get a broader strategy overview at the investor day but as we start to think about fiscal 20 would you envision being able to grow core sales next year given the tough comps especially in the first half of the year does that international component that you just mentioned in phase 2 become necessary in order to get that lift and then just any update that you have on your ability to cover tariffs would also be helpful julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah sure so fiscal 20 we ll give guidance in april which is our traditional window before that so we won t i know everyone s looking for it and i m sure everyone wants to know exactly what the fiscal 20 forecast is for the company when we re not going to be able to provide that at the end of the third quarter call i don t think so many companies do that and we would give that guidance in april in terms of the very big picture on fiscal 20 we do believe that we can continue growing history is on our side we have a good track record on that subject and we have the building blocks that said we are working through our budget cycle right now this is exactly the time of year for this we re right in the thick of it and we ll have a lot more to say in april in terms of the quarterly comparisons i know a lot of people focus on right like this quarter last quarter the last half we had a spectacular first half to the year and we re going to bring in a year between 3 8 and 4 8 growth for the year and that s on top of the 5 9 last year and the growth from the year before that the story goes on and on i guess my point is we think in years when we forecast and we think in five year chunks when we strategize and phase 2 is a five year thought and our guidance is always in one year chunks and we ll do that again in terms of the first half therefore we re not so worried about whether we ll be able to anniversary in one particular quarter or another in fact in q4 after you ve all done the math already you ll see that with the guidance that we just gave will give us very strong year in fact stronger than we originally forecasted at the beginning of the year it turned out to be that a lot of that has come in the first half we just add another 2 4 of net sales this quarter and we ll get a 3 8 to 4 8 year so everybody realizes that that means that the tough compare in the fourth quarter because of the cold and flu season doesn t give you all the growth in all the quarters so we re not worried about that i know the market gets upset on such things but our businesses are lumpy seasons are lumpy and you can never predict all these things that s why we don t give quarterly guidance in the first place and then in the case of the multi year plan i don t want to make too many promises about the long term future but we have given long term guidance and it s our intention over a many year period to be in line with that guidance brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer i think you had a second question on tariffs chris that i can start on and maybe julien can add too if he wants our pricing actions are intended to offset the full amount of gross profit dollar impact from tariff increases that doesn t mean we ll be 100 successful and as we called out in the prepared remarks it could have some impact on consumption and customer orders which we believe what happened in the short term but in the long term we would expect stability and no remaining issues the so in a perfect world if we were able to get all the price increases in place they are designed to offset 100 of the gross profit impact dollar impact we are not stopping there though we have put in place preliminary mitigation actions with respect to sourcing and are continuing a lot of those actions because some of those take a longer period of time to get into place so we ve started that process and i think you know as a result of the whole tariff thing there ll be a rebalancing in our sourcing structure and it ll be more fairly balanced in some other regions other than china which is probably a healthy result to begin with because we ll have more of our supply closer to the us and have shorter lead times and we ll have a diversified sourcing base and maybe in some cases we ll be dual sourced we ll have the same product made partially in mexico for instance and in china potentially so i think i ve said it before the sourcing action would hopefully be viewed as icing on the cake or gravy on top of the pricing action that we re taking so i just want to be clear the intention is to offset 100 we may not get totally there but i feel very good that we re going to get a high percentage of the tariffs offset and then any sourcing actions would be kind of icing on the cake chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah julien r mininberg chief executive officer director i think you ve got it the only add i d build is never waste a good crisis when there s an opportunity to take a look in the mirror look in our footprint so when you think about phase two of our plan and ask how we think the various categories and geographies will end and then relook at what our sourcing footprint is and the current tariff structure as well as opportunities to shorten lead times and the other things that brian mentioned it creates a chance to just put a bright light on plans we ve already had make some adjustments and reoptimize so that s exactly what s happening in helen of troy chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it very helpful and then just one quick follow up and i ll get back in so it strikes me that the market has been so volatile and weak to some extent i wonder if that s improved your negotiating power when you think about your ability to do m a and how you re thinking about the ability to maybe get better prices on some of the deals that you found that you think are attractive thank you julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you re talking about m a or you re talking about sourcing when you ask that chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst sorry that this would be specifically your m a strategy your ability to get assets potentially at better pricing or not and then just broadly any updates on your deployment of capital toward that end thanks julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah okay let s just start with a big picture on deployment of capital it hasn t come up yet in the call but i m sure everybody saw in our press release and heard in the comment we made a statement last quarter and we were trying to be very clear with the market at 122 90 we saw our stock is a strong buy and we bought it we bought 800 000 shares a little bit more actually and in years we have not made a bigger buyback than this with the exception of the tender offer a few years ago so there s a message in there and that buyback is good for the math as well that said our primary capital strategy remains acquisition and you probably saw that even though we took on the 100 million worth of expense we also reduced our debt by 85 million sorry the low 80s ph million during the quarter and our ratio is now 1 4 so not only operationally are we in the best place we ve ever been on the subject of acquisition but financially we are poised in terms of looking for assets that we ve been aggressive on the subject i think we ve told various people in various discussions various versions of the same but it all comes down to the common theme which is we re a bit picky to make sure that we have the right asset it s not so much about price it s about fix and quality of asset as opposed to how accretive and how much would we pay and how we finance our balance sheet is more than able to finance the stuff that we re looking at and in terms of the picky i just wanted to say that there s a few really good ones actually that looked on the surface to the point where we engaged engaged heavily but once you get under the hood there s enough hair on them that i think you d be disappointed if we buy them and frankly we were not going to go further so we never got all the way to the point where it was you re going to get the best possible price in the market there i think we could have bought any of those assets and we were willing to do so if it was right for us and on pricing i don t know if jack or brian you might have something on that brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer well i was just going to add that i think it s too early to see any reflection in the prices from the recent stock market volatility so we have not seen that yet but i would attribute that to just being too soon to have those reflected in pricing yet chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much for all that julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you bet chris operator we will now take our next question linda ann bolton weiser from d a davidson please go ahead linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst hi how are you julien r mininberg chief executive officer director hi linda nice to hear from you happy new year linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst happy new year so i believe that on the last call when you were giving us a really good rundown of all the tariff impacts and everything i think you said the worst case scenario impact on profit growth in fy 20 would be like 5 percentage points if i m recollecting correctly so what you re saying now is that you re actually hoping to offset with pricing all of the impact so brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer yeah i don t linda it s brian i think we gave dollar unmitigated dollar ranges and we had to give two ranges one for whether the last round stayed at 10 or went to 25 so we i never put it in percentage point terms and i couldn t tell you off the cuff what the percentages are we gave dollar ranges and that was we tried to be clear and say that was 100 unmitigated just to give people some perspective on it and because we hadn t completed our negotiations on pricing or explored all our other mitigation options we re now much further along with respect to pricing and i m saying that the intention is to offset 100 of the tariff increases through pricing and have try to say it s no guarantee that we will get completely there and there could be an impact on consumption and customer orders in the short term but yes in a way to think about it is the goal is to offset a 100 of the gross dollar impact through the pricing and then pick up additional wins if we can in sourcing julien r mininberg chief executive officer director and on the sourcing side well it s not as straightforward as ok let s work on the price we can work backwards into our supply chain we put this in our prepared remarks as well with productivity initiatives we have them internally always externally always as well but there s some specific ones that we are pursuing in china and in mexico that create opportunity and some savings to help mitigate and then both commodities and foreign exchange move around but they move in our favor frankly when commodity costs come down for example you ve seen the price of oil over the last few months you ve seen the price of copper over the last two months in the form various forms of plastic which we use and lots of things with motors and metal windings that use copper these are opportunities to gain back some ground on the subject ph of pricing or hold off increases that might come from a supplier who s facing themselves some increase on commodities that are going in the wrong direction like cardboard for example for cartons and it s well known that carton is an escalating commodity and then in terms of foreign exchange the rmb has been weaker than the us dollar for some time now triggered or exacerbated anyway by the trade war and some of that broader macroeconomic china slowdown and when we trade in dollars in china our dollars buy more rmbs and that gives an opportunity to help mitigate price differences so these kinds of things and as before you get into factory moves removing sku between chinese factories let alone multi regional moves like under the new nafta law so there s lots of stuff that s not just putting out a price sheet linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst thank you that s very helpful and then when you talk about just a possibility of consumption or order declines or softening because of the price increases can you give a little more color on which categories because i think of your stuff as mostly smaller gadgetry type things that i wouldn t think that consumer is so price sensitive over so what are you referring to and are you more referring to competition still being able to not take the pricing for you like what are you talking about in terms of consumption decline due to these price increases julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah just to be clear we re not anticipating consumption declines our products provide an excellent value they re generally the leaders in the market they have some of the best attributes the best quality the best brand names the best features our products are winners consumers know that and you can see it in the online ratings you can see it in our market shares and you can see it in our premium that we often command as compared to competitors in the category so we re very confident in the value equation that we give we also are confident that the us consumer has a lot of tailwind right now those things i ve mentioned in the prepared remarks taxes are generally lower depending exactly which person situation there s more people with jobs you saw the labor reports last week and all three of the major indicators went positive i m talking about the number of jobs that were created the wage growth of the people who had jobs and the labor participation rate which means are just more people are working so all those things put money in people s pockets and now they go to the shelf but for the first time in years they ll see products that have a bit of inflation in them and there has not been inflation in this country of any meaningful way in the last couple of years and certainly not in our categories there s plenty of competition out there but i don t think they all can say the same positive things i said about our products some of them are excellent some of them are less so and customers have alternatives and consumers do too it s a competitive marketplace that is yet to be tested and that s the only comment we re really trying to make to see at the new price points that retailers may choose to put on their shelves what consumer response will be so if you pick something of a low dollar value to your point before about gadgetry type of item pick a carrot peeler or a can opener or something that s 10 12 item when it comes from us there s always been 3 to 5 alternatives in a discount store that has nothing to do with tariff nothing to do with pricing it s just always been true that said if our item now let s say goes up 1 and the other one only goes up 0 25 that relative equation has not been retested and it s also possible to cross a price point like let s say something crosses the 10 price point or the 25 price point or under more extensive expensive items like an air purifier it might cross the 200 or 250 price point something like this and so at some point consumers have an opinion about what they re willing to buy and how much they re willing to spend how much money they ve got in their pocket et cetera i saw christmas is very encouraging on this subject and while all the numbers haven t been published yet from christmas i think it s well known that the christmas season was generally positive and consumers demonstrated with their wallets that they are willing to spend that money that s in their pocket to buy the things that they want and so when prices go up a little now it ll be retested of whether there s any new normal in the new equations when prices move around that s all we re saying linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst okay and then just can i follow up on the m a topic we know that you ve been generally successful with m a and have done a great job especially for things like hydro flask but i m just wondering with what we re looking at possibly in terms of china s slowdown seeping over into the us are you considering in your mind maybe just keeping your balance sheet really clean and keeping your powder dry and just not doing something for now and not levering up because maybe investors might value at this point having a really clean unleveraged balance sheet and that might be the best thing to do in other words i m just wondering should you lever up right ahead of a potential recession that s what i m kind of wondering julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah it s a great question we do debated internally sometimes that very safe route look at our leverage ratio it s low and it just got lower look at our stock buyback behavior there s been about 1 2 million shares repurchased by us just within this fiscal year alone and we brought the leverage down so that strategy creates value and that said operationally it when we find the right asset even with some of those larger macro concerns we should be able to add value to the asset in any reasonable economic environment in a tougher one like you re concerned about if there s a recession or contagion or something like that everything certainly gets harder on the one hand on the other hand the winners tend to win in those recessions and we ve seen that before in the last recession especially in health home for example it was an area where we just got stronger and i guess my point is if we find the right thing i think we would move forward if there s massive macro data that says caution all around it would make us a bit more cautious but our balance sheet and our operations are ready and if we find the right asset we would act on it and yet we re keenly aware of the environment you re talking about meanwhile as i ve said many times in many in meetings the money has not been burning a hole in our in our pocket we have not made a significant purchase of any asset since 2016 and this is at the hydro flask acquisition and since then we ve been aggressive with the stock buybacks especially when the market looked at us and didn t see much value we thought they were crazy and we saw tons of value so we bought back the stock so we re not afraid to go both ways as they say and we ll do the right thing not only for the balance sheet but for our portfolio and our operations with a sharp eye on the macro horizon brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer i would just add that we ve always had a conservative approach to leverage and we would never lever above i don t know pick the number 4 times leverage or something like that so i think we would if we were going to do something we would choose to minimize our risk through not taking on a high amount of leverage and we ve always had the ability to generate a lot of cash to quickly delever so that for those reasons we would consider an acquisition even if we felt like there was some recessionary signs but we wouldn t do it so aggressively that we ended up with ultra high leverage ratio and we ve always had the ability to delever quickly which would help i think even in a recessionary environment we would still be able to delever quickly so for those reasons i think we would continue to consider acquisition even if the trends are totally in our favor from a macro perspective julien r mininberg chief executive officer director it could also affect pricing to the question that chris carey asked before in that kind of environment multiples and prices come down interest rates are a little higher now than they were a few years ago so all these things the market has a way of factoring them in very efficiently i think what we would not do in a very negative environment is bet the farm so you re not going to see swing for the fences we ve not done that really ever as a company but to go in the face of a heavy negative macroeconomic environment and bet the ranch we re not that smart and not that stupid at the same time i don t think we would do that linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst thanks and can i just ask one little quick one what percentage of your total sales are in china and what percent of your e commerce sales are in china julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah we don t break it out it s been growing rapidly i can say that it s been very successful for us as market leadership and those thermometers has been true for some time the rapid growth has been exceptional we ve had an internal project to grow by multiples in the last couple of years we ve exceeded it i can give you lots of qualitative indicators that say that this is a winning area if you re worried about the slowdown try and look into dimensionalize which i think is what you re really trying to do the number brian gave before which is of the 10 million of reduction which is only to the high end of our guidance is to be technical difficulty repetitive i m sorry but we see the market doesn t like it when we lower guidance but raise our earnings they may forget that this is going to be a 3 8 to 4 8 growth year and in china we re actually going to have an up year yet again we re just going to have less up year than we originally forecasted because of this brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer linda i what we can disclose is our percentage of sales in the asia pacific region last fiscal year was 5 1 of our total but growing rapidly so i would expect that number to be higher for fiscal year 19 but we give that breakout annually but just as a starting point it s 5 1 of the total in the asia pacific region for last fiscal year and it grew 25 last fiscal year and is continuing to grow this year julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah and then on the online side it s not the lion share of our online we do a lot more online in the united states it s just a large part of the chinese business is online so that s the reason we made that distinction so if that business that brian just described with numbers has tendency ph of online that s been its biggest growth driver if that slows down a little bit it s not surprising then our forecast takes a hit in that 5 million ish that we re talking about i m frankly surprised we re having such a discussion about 5 million ish linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst okay thank you so much i really appreciate it julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you bet linda operator we will now take our next question from steve marotta of c l king and associates please go ahead steven louis marotta cl king associates analyst good morning julien and brian i know we re running over so i ll just offer two quick questions and take the rest offline from a sourcing rebalancing standpoint can you remind us where you are right now from a china exposure to cogs domestically and where you d expect to be 12 months from now julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah brian i believe we breakout the total number and while he is going to dig it up for you steve we ll give you that number because we do disclose it while he is doing and i ll remind it s true that it varies a lot by segments so in the case of beauty and housewares we re primarily china sourced in the case of health home we re roughly even in dollar terms between china and the americas with mexico being the primary source for the americas products so think of thermometers humidifiers air purifiers vaporizers a lot of this stuff is made in mexico for them brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer so is that ph right currently 70 well for last fiscal year 74 of our product was sourced in the far east and i would say at this stage it s hard to give an estimate on how we could shift that percentage because we re early days in looking at new regions and auctions it s not like we didn t look at it in the past but in the past the analysis always proved out that china was by far the most efficient julien r mininberg chief executive officer director and the numbers moved numbers moved the lines have recrawled as a new equilibrium brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer right so now they shifted because of tariffs and because china is becoming more expensive the lines are starting to cross so that in conjunction with the massive impact from tariffs has got us looking at this harder and the analysis shows that it s getting closed to equal or maybe even the lines are crossing so it s early days steve i can t i don t think it would be prudent for us to give you what we think it could be in a year at this stage i think there will be more to come on that in the next couple of quarters we re at 74 currently julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah the way and the way looking forward the way i would look at it and the way we look at it internally is health home is roughly at 50 50 the company has the balance that you just heard in last fiscal year and for housewares and beauty it s almost completely china with the lines moving think of things like labor rates the chinese labor rates has been going up almost like clockwork for the last seven or eight years now 15 20 a year it s not that big a component of our cost of goods but compound that over seven eight year period labor gets to be more expensive exchange rates if you look at the rmb versus the dollar over the last seven or eight years and the mexican peso versus the dollar over the last seven years you re going to see two entirely different scenarios and then if you look at lead times inventory levels and then cube meaning like let s say so you re making a thing like a vaporizer or salad spinner so that s a big item they re roughly the same size they re very light so you re going to cube out a container across the pacific long before you gross it out with weight and the lead time is longer so why would you ship all that air and yet fill up that container that you could put more weight in filling it up with something else like thermometer or a hair dryer something like that you re going to be able to get a lot more units and a lot more dollar value in that container before you cube it out or gross it out so this stuff is all being factored into equation because it s all moving around and because the rule of law has changed right nafta 2 or at usmca is i don t know if it s a done deal but appears closely to ratification and in the case of the china thing i believe the delegations are meeting this week as we speak on the subject of whether or not there s going to be a new normal coming out of china and meanwhile there s also new congress in the united states that you wanted to fight about everything so i can t tell you how all that s going to go i could simply tell you that s the way we look at it my response is very simple never waste a good crisis i said it before and when the numbers move around it creates opportunity we re capitalists and we re going to put our assets where we think they re most efficient and get the best value we can for our shareholders and make the best margins we can in our business steven louis marotta cl king associates analyst that s great thank you i ll take the rest offline julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah no problem operator it appears there are no further questions at this time

transformation plan beginning in march that s the start of our fiscal 2020 brian will then take a deeper look into our financials and following that we ll open up the line for your questions as you saw in our earnings release this morning we concluded our third quarter with continued net sales momentum we grew 2 4 in the quarter which included core business growth of 2 9 adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations in the third quarter declined 4 year over year in line with our expectations and reflecting the factors we highlighted in our last earnings call these factors include the concentration of incremental marketing spend in the third quarter to support our leadership brands and match our seasonality the impact initially of tariffs ahead of mitigation measures we have taken and some mix effects leadership brands and online sales led the way this quarter leadership brands grew net sales 4 9 in the quarter and online sales grew 6 now accounting for 18 of the total sales of the company our seven leadership brands are now approximately 80 of our sales the strategic choices we are making around investment in digital marketing and online support for our leadership brands are critical and are paying off with sales growth market share gains for some and improvements at all touch points of the consumer journey by investing in more and better content and using increasingly sophisticated marketing strategies we are creating an ever stronger presence online many studies confirm consumers spend more and more time surfing searching socializing and shopping on digital devices as a consumer centric company we are focused on ensuring our brands and products stay prominent in the hearts the minds and the checkout carts of consumers around the world and even as we grow faster online than we do in brick and mortar in store support remains a key investment for us in order to command the shelf stay competitive on price and help customers maintain their growing e commerce business at the end of the day we re focused on remaining top of mind wherever consumers spend their time and their money consumer demand for our products remains strong in the us where the majority of our sales occur more households have additional discretionary income with growing employment and labor participation rates wage growth and generally speaking lower taxes we see this reflected where we have access to point of sale and to market share data outside the us we have seen pressure on chinese consumers particularly online as the rapid growth of their economy slows and uncertainty from the trade war touches all shores even as we begin rebalancing our supply chain we remain confident in china as a long term strategic source of goods and a growth vector for helen of troy we see its growing middle class increasing childbirth rate and new household formation as key growth drivers for our brands and inspiration for new products the whole asia region remains a top priority for us as we continue to build out our branded presence in these markets as we balance the needs to manage the costs of the trade war some foreign exchange headwinds and continued investment in the most promising opportunities for our leadership brands we have been raising prices focusing primarily on products impacted by higher tariffs overall our conversations with customers about pricing have been constructive and we believe we ll successfully mitigate a significant portion of higher costs through pricing we also are pursuing productivity initiatives internally and with our suppliers leveraging changes in commodity costs and foreign exchange and working toward a new sourcing balance between china the americas and europe while retail price points have been relatively stable for years retailers will likely pass on some of the increases testing consumers price sensitivity turning to our strategic progress i would like to report key steps since our last earnings call toward further improving our portfolio and asset efficiency we put our strong cash flow and capital allocation strategy to work in the third quarter we returned 100 million to shareholders through the repurchase of just over 800 000 shares of our stock we used our remaining free cash flow to reduce helen of troy s leverage ratio to 1 4 times keeping us in a strong financial position to make additional acquisition with the transformation plan continuing to strengthen our shared services platform we have never been better prepared operationally to add new businesses to our portfolio we nevertheless remain highly selective as we look for the right assets to augment our leadership brands build out our regional footprint and leverage our scale project refuel is also progressing as expected and continues to target annualized savings of approximately 8 million to 10 million over the duration of the plan we are reinvesting some of this and dropping some to strengthen the bottom line in beauty the reinvestment focus on critical areas such as developing new products new appliance products attracting outside new talent and dialing up our marketing support especially online turning now to our business segments housewares delivered another excellent quarter with net sales increased by 11 4 standout categories during the quarter were specialty hydration and coffee collections cooking prep and kitchen organization as discussed previously we continued to make incremental marketing investments to build out digital content that engages consumers on the outstanding innovation design and performance at oxo and also hydro flask products all with a sharp eye on roi and the challenging competitive environment hydro flask continues to win third party data confirms the brand continues to hold the number one market share position in the insulated metal water bottle segment and has grown share significantly over the past 12 months hydro flask continues to enjoy excellent point of sale performance across the diverse distribution channels we track which include npd ssi active lifestyle industry natural foods online and also in specific customers stronger in store presentations across bottles and accessories we started over the holidays are showing early encouraging results we are seeing healthy consumer takeaway with notable complementary sales from accessories hydro flask also continues to earn new distribution and expand its geographic footprint in health home our largest and our most global business net sales decreased 0 7 primarily due to a drag of 0 6 from unfavorable foreign currency exchange the core business was essentially flat year over year versus the strong third quarter performance last year when we benefited from new product launches and international distribution gains domestically we further expanded distribution in health home and saw growth in some seasonal categories another devastating wildfire season on the west coast struck in november late in the quarter leading to a modest year over year sales increase for our market leading honeywell air purifiers as a reminder in october of last year the west coast also felt the impact of a heavy fire season which increased air purifier sales in the year ago base also in the base is last year s historic thomas fire which struck during our fourth quarter reflecting on the current cough cold and flu season we ve experienced a more normal start and there are currently no indications of a repeat of last year s particularly high incidence of flu the exact timing and duration of the season for each symptom can vary but most types of respiratory illness including flu usually begin to peak between december and february and they wind down by early spring this season s illness rates so far are following this pattern as well with increased incidents in recent weeks of symptoms such as fever cough and congestion these correlate very strongly with consumer purchases of our thermometers humidifiers and inhalants under the vicks and braun names the specific impact on our shipments depends on customer inventories stocking patterns and replenishment rates as their upfront purchases via direct import or from our warehouses sell through given the pattern so far this year our outlook continues to assume a normal season for the balance of fiscal 2019 now turning to beauty net sales decreased 3 in the quarter we are seeing some improvements from our strategic efforts to stabilize appliances while down slightly in the quarter following the discontinuation of certain brands and products appliances benefited from new products international sales and growth in the online channel we are also growing appliance share online the revlon volumizers are particularly hot seller serving as a great example of consumer centric innovation at work it delivers on the consumer need for speed styling and drying in one convenient time saving product it consistently earns four to five star reviews and has garnered considerable attention in the media and online as an it item looking at what we ve accomplished so far this fiscal year to date we have quite a lot to be proud of the third quarter built on a very strong first half on a full year basis we expect to show solid growth even in the face of a tough compare to last year s especially strong cough cold and flu season nine months in we ve returned value to shareholders through the repurchase of over 1 2 million shares while simultaneously lowering leverage we remain in a strong position to deploy capital toward further acquisition we now expect fiscal 2019 to deliver net sales growth of 3 8 to 4 8 versus fiscal 2018 which was also a strong sales growth year at 5 9 on the bottom line we have raised our adjusted eps for fiscal 2019 to 7 70 to 7 95 per share reflecting the most recent share repurchase and that represents growth of 6 4 to 9 8 versus fiscal 2018 as we look forward to fiscal 2020 which begins this march we have made our strategic choices for a second phase of helen of troy s transformation this next phase is designed to build on the successes of the past five years we will focus on driving further improvements to our current businesses expand our geographic footprint our global shared services will advance and the overall strength of our organization as well we will also seek to add to our leadership brand portfolio through further acquisition we believe we have the balance sheet the capabilities the culture and the passionate owner minded people to take our transformation to the next level we look forward to sharing more during our next investor day which is currently planned for late spring with that i will now turn the call over to brian brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer thank you julien good morning everyone before discussing the quarter in more detail i d like to start with a few broad points first my comments today will be regarding our results from continuing operations for the third quarter of both fiscal 2019 and 2018 unless otherwise indicated second during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard as a result we have reclassified certain expenses from sg a to reduction of net sales revenue corresponding amounts in the prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation so that both periods are comparable please see the related table and footnotes in the accompanying press release for further information finally tariff increases began to impact our cost of goods sold during the third quarter as expected while we have implemented pricing actions and other mitigation measures the both of these actions did not become materially effective in the third quarter our pricing actions will begin to provide a meaningful offset to the tariffs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and we expect them to be effectively completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 this is due to the negotiation and notice periods involved in taking pricing actions the company is targeting to offset as much of the tariff gross profit dollar impact as possible however a 25 tariff impact on costs translates to 11 to 13 increase on the price of product to retailers as such even if we keep ourselves whole in gross dollars gross profit margin is expected to decline further although the pricing actions are intended to keep us whole in terms of gross profit dollars there is no guarantee that they won t reduce retail consumption or customer orders in the short term we have not resolved product pricing with one key retailer in two product categories and we are currently not shipping these particular items to this one customer while we expect some disruption from pricing actions in the short term including the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we believe we re making the right choices for the long term health of our business and that our products continue to offer attractive value propositions at the higher prices now turning to a review of the quarter we posted adjusted diluted eps at the midpoint of our stated range of flat to down 8 compared to the same period last year which was in line with our expectations as we highlighted on our second quarter call this is largely due to the planned increase in marketing spending in fiscal 2019 coupled with the concentration of spending in the third quarter along with the tariff increases we began to realize in the third quarter turning to a more detailed review consolidated sales revenue was 431 1 million a 2 4 increase over the prior year core business revenue grew 2 9 revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in brick and mortar sales in our housewares segment and growth in consolidated online sales sales in the online channel grew approximately 6 year over year to comprise approximately 18 of our consolidated net sales in the third quarter the sequential decline in online sales growth rate was primarily due to a deceleration of growth in our china e commerce business and a corresponding build up of inventory in the channel primarily impacting health home and a reduction in inventory levels by a key online retailer primarily impacting housewares online sell through in housewares continues to be healthy and is growing double digits leadership brand sales grew approximately 4 9 our leadership brand sales now represent approximately 80 of our consolidated net sales for the quarter compared to approximately 78 for the same period last year housewares net sales increased 11 4 reflecting point of sale strength and incremental distribution with existing domestic customers and increase in online sales and new product introductions health home net sales decreased 0 7 with the decline primarily due to the unfavorable impact from net foreign currency fluctuations of 1 1 million or 0 6 the core business within health home posted a slight decline of 0 2 reflecting lower online sales and the unfavorable comparative impact from international distribution gains new product introductions and a strong cough cold flu season in the prior year these factors were partially offset by strong seasonal category growth in gains in distribution and shelf space with existing domestic customers as julien mentioned the segment did see strong point of sale activity in the air category related to recent wildfires however it was largely comparable to the activity in the same period last year beauty net sales decreased 3 primarily due to a decline in the personal care category and the discontinuation of certain brands and products these factors more than offset continued growth in the online channel new product introductions in the retail appliance category and an increase in international sales segment net sales were unfavorably impacted by net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 0 6 million or 0 6 consolidated gross profit margin was 42 2 compared to 42 3 for the same period last year the 0 1 percentage point decrease is primarily due to less favorable product mix and the impact of tariff increases partially offset by margin lift from growth in our leadership brands sg a was 28 of net sales compared to 26 1 for the same period last year the 1 9 percentage point increase is primarily due to higher advertising expense increased freight costs increased share based compensation expense and higher product claim expense these factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements the favorable comparative impact of restructuring charges in the same period last year and lower amortization expense the primary driver of higher share based compensation expense in the quarter was due to the issuance of transformation shares to every helen of troy associate which we highlighted on our last earnings call these transformation shares vest over a three year period gaap operating income was 61 3 million or 14 2 of net sales this compares to 67 3 million or 16 of net sales in the same period last year which included restructuring charges of 1 1 million adjusted operating income was 70 6 million or 16 4 of net sales compared to 77 6 million or 18 4 of net sales the 2 percentage point decrease in adjusted operating margin primarily reflects higher advertising expense the impact of tariff increases and higher freight expense these factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements lower amortization and the favorable margin impact from leadership brand growth turning now to adjusted operating margin by segment housewares adjusted operating margin was 22 8 compared to 24 7 the 1 9 percentage point decrease primarily reflects higher advertising expense higher annual incentive compensation expense related to current year performance higher freight expense and higher rent expense related to previously announced new office space these factors were partially offset by the margin impact of more favorable a more favorable product and channel mix and increased operating leverage from net sales growth health home adjusted operating margin was 13 compared to 17 the 4 percentage point decrease primarily reflects higher advertising expense increased promotional spending and trade support with retail customers the impact of tariff increases the margin impact of a less favorable product and channel mix and higher personnel expense these factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements beauty adjusted operating margin was 13 5 compared to 13 3 the 0 2 percentage point increase primarily reflects lower amortization and personnel cost savings from project refuel these factors were partially offset by higher advertising and higher freight expense our effective tax rate was 6 9 compared to 8 2 the same period last year the decrease is due to shifts in the mix of taxable income across our tax jurisdictions income from continuing operations was 54 3 million or 2 06 per diluted share this compares to 58 6 million or 2 15 per diluted share in the same period last year which included after tax restructuring charges of 0 04 a share non gaap adjusted income from continuing operations was 63 2 million or 2 40 per diluted share compared to 68 1 million or 2 50 per diluted share the 4 decrease in adjusted diluted eps primarily reflects higher advertising expense the impact of tariff increases and higher freight expense partially offset by better operating leverage the margin left from leadership brand growth lower interest expense lower tax expense and the impact of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding loss from discontinued operations was 4 9 million compared to a loss of 89 1 million in the same period last year the loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflects the impact of the settlement of the supplemental payment amount associated with the sale of healthy directions during the quarter we ve reduced the estimated value of the supplemental payment to 10 8 million and recorded an after tax charge of 4 4 million the amount was adjusted based on the settlement with respect to the calculation of the performance of healthy directions through february 28 2018 during the quarter we also recorded an after tax charge of 0 5 million resulting from the resolution of certain contingencies the loss in the same quarter last year primarily reflects after tax impairment charges recorded prior to the divestiture now moving on to our financial position accounts receivable turnover increased to 69 4 days compared to 65 4 days in the same period last year inventory was 300 6 million compared to 278 1 million at the same time last year inventory turnover improved to 3 4 times compared to 2 8 times in the prior year period net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 increased 6 6 million to 109 5 million the increase was primarily due to an increase in income from continuing operations higher share based compensation and an increase in cash provided from accounts payable these factors were partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory and a dispute settlement payment of 15 million made in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 total short and long term debt decreased 86 5 million to 339 7 million compared to 426 2 million at the end of the third quarter last year we ended the third quarter with the leverage ratio of 1 4 times compared to 1 8 times as previously reported at the end of the third quarter last year we were able to continue to delever wealth while also repurchasing almost 814 000 shares of our common stock for 100 million on an average price of less than 123 per share we are pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date which we believe keep us on track to deliver another strong year of revenue and adjusted diluted eps growth for fiscal 2019 we now expect consolidated net sales revenue in the range of 1 535 billion to 1 55 billion which implies consolidated sales growth of 3 8 to 4 8 our sales outlook now also includes the following items which together account for the 10 million decline in the high end of our outlook and primarily impact the health home segment an expected unfavorable impact from pricing actions that have not been resolved with the key customer in two of our product categories and a deceleration of growth in china with a corresponding buildup of inventory in the channel and the impact that we believe trade tensions are having on both the us and chinese consumers we are still very optimistic about our prospects in china and opportunity for growth in the region and continue to consider it to be a key strategic initiative for the company going forward our net sales outlook continues to assume the severity of the cough cold flu season will be in line with historical averages which unfavorably impacts the full year comparisons to fiscal 2018 by 1 1 our net sales outlook also assumes that december 2018 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the remainder of the year we have updated our segment growth rate expectations for the full fiscal year and now expect an increase in housewares net sales growth to 11 to 13 health home net sales growth of 2 to 4 including an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 3 from the average cough cold flu assumption and beauty net sales declined in the low to mid single digits which remains the same despite the decline in the high end of our net sales outlook range we are increasing our eps outlook to reflect the lower share count from open market repurchases made during the quarter we now expect consolidated gaap diluted eps from continuing operations of 6 35 to 6 51 and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations in the range of 7 70 to 7 95 based on an estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 26 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 our eps outlook continues to include an increase in growth investments for fiscal 2019 in the range of 18 to 22 year over year as we spend into the strength of the current year support new product launches and accelerate the development of digital assets and investment in digital marketing to drive future growth our outlook also includes the impact of expected commodity and freight inflation on our cost of goods sold as well as the expected impact of tariff changes in their current form while we currently anticipate achieving our fiscal 2019 revised full year outlook the current us china trade environment is certainly a concern and could provide a meaningful headwind next fiscal year if we ultimately realize the full year impact of tariff changes in their current form looking at our expectations for tax we now expect to report gaap effective tax rate range of 7 3 to 8 4 and an adjusted effective tax rate range of 6 9 to 7 7 for the full fiscal year 2019 please refer to the schedule entitled effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate in the tables to the press release our outlook for diluted eps from continuing operations assumes that december 2018 foreign currency exchange rates will remain constant for the remainder of the fiscal year other eps assumptions are consistent with our previous guidance the likelihood and potential impact of any fiscal 2019 acquisitions or additional divestitures future asset impairment charges future foreign currency fluctuations or further share repurchases are unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated therefore they are not included in the company s sales and earnings outlook and now i d like to turn it back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions we ll take our first question from bob labick of cjs securities go ahead sir your line is open bob labick cjs securities analyst good morning and happy new year julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah good morning bob happy new year bob labick cjs securities analyst thanks i wanted to start with two quick kind of clarifications and i ll ask one thematic one and i ll hop back in queue you mentioned a pricing dispute with one customer in two categories can you tell us what percentage of sales are impacted there or really any kind of clarification is this a normal occurrence or what s kind of going on there julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah let me start here and brian may have more to say pricing is a lumpy process it s easy to say in a conference room or a business meeting we re ph going to take some pricing and that said in these categories in our industry there hasn t been pricing action in years so to go into the market and take pricing is a process customers understand it i think consumers understand about the trade war and we ve been largely successful in fact it s just one customer and it s only in two of the 10 or 11 categories we trade in health home and even in that one customer i think eight or nine of the categories have already been accepted and we re shipping as normal brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer while we didn t take price increases in all categories because not all categories were impacted by the tariff but we were successful in getting price increases in all but two of the categories that were impacted by tariffs julien r mininberg chief executive officer director correct and in housewares we ve also raised prices on the tariff affected categories and have not had significant concerns either in this one customer we re holding our ground we re doing the right thing we re doing the right thing for the brand we re doing the right thing in the marketplace and we ve done right with the other customers and frankly so have they so this is the right move in terms of dimensionalizing you heard brian say that the primary driver of our small change to the upper end only of our guidance on sales that 10 million is primarily due to this item and so that gets you a sense of dimension brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer well so it s due to a combination of this and the slowdown in china e commerce so if you want to think 50 50 you re probably not going to be that far off but we re not going to give specific guidance but that could hopefully help you dimensionalize it julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah and so the price so i make sure that on the public call and while we re officially on record that there s absolutely no misunderstanding of any kind our pricing actions so far have been successful we have been able to take pricing in categories that traditionally do not have price increases as part of their normal cycle that s a statement measured in years and we have been able to take pricing with the vast majority of our customers in the vast majority of affected categories we are lowering the guidance to deal with those two items that brian is talking about this is one of them and we re transparent we want you to know and my last comment on it is pricing is a lumpy process it is not the kind of thing that you just send out a note saying here s our new price when shall we ship you with the new higher prices what s your order please customers want to have a discussion they want to push back they want to see the math they want to have a meeting they want to see what competitors do they want to see what their alternatives are and this is a marketplace and in marketplaces things have a way of working out but it doesn t just go from one day to the next brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer well and i d like just to add one thing with respect to the doing the right thing part imagine if you are talking to retail customer a and they found out that retail customer b didn t have to take a price increase the retail customer a wouldn t be very happy but it s really the only choice is to stick to our position and take stick hold to our ground and take the pricing even if it s a little bit lumpy and a little bit disruptive to sales in the short term we believe that this is a short term item and that in the long run will end up in a good place on pricing and profitability julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah and we already are in most of the customers and most of the categories brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer right bob labick cjs securities analyst okay super thank you for that clarity and then just maybe two seconds on the chinese e commerce issues going on here it sounds like just maybe some inventory in the channel could you tell us really what you re selling in there what categories if you can and then the bigger question i really want to ask is international has become a bigger theme for you over the last several quarters can you talk a little bit about how big the opportunity is and maybe how you view that opportunity now versus a few years ago and what s different and where the growth will come in that area julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah two great questions first to clarify on the chinese on the e commerce e commerce is an important part of the chinese market china is an important part of asia and asia is a winning area for us we don t disclose to asia as a specific category or by specific breakout but i will just tell everyone in the public call here that we re talking about thermometers is the primary driver in china and it s primarily online we ve been tremendously successful and if you ve listened us over the last couple of years really not just quarters we ve frequently highlighted success in china and asia and online and in thermometers what s happening here is there is some slowdown and as a result there s an inventory buildup in the category that we ll have to play through prices are also sorting themselves out and in china in general there s just a bit of slowdown of some pretty heady growth that 6 8 9 kind of numbers that have been going on for years in china are believed to be coming down we re seeing a little bit of that but you have to see the underlying picture there s roughly 16 million births a year in china that s a growing number that s roughly 4 times the number of births in the united states every single year and those babies go into households many of them newly formed those households in a rising middle class with more discretionary income and they want to do right for their families just like anybody else in the world they want the best and when it comes to a thermometer it s well known that the braun products are exceptionally capable they re generally better than any other here thermometers available on the market they re not made in china and chinese consumers tend to favor that especially for healthcare products and we have been the market leader so it s just great to see to see that slow down a little and a little inventory stack up that s what we re talking about and if you take that 10 million that i mentioned that we mentioned in our guidance and that split that brian alluded to you can get a little sense of the of the size here and as it pertains to asia broadly and international sorry asia in general and international broadly international is a highly underdeveloped part of helen of troy s business during phase one of the transformation which is the last five years we ve focused more on domestic than we have international and all of the key themes that you ve heard me talk about at length over the last few years on helen of troy have been playing through with some pretty good success we re now at a point of development where we can export more of that success in terms of our business model we re much better integrated and operationally capable than we have ever been before the shared services platform is increasingly standardized and synchronized and the back offices around the world are on pretty standard processes the front of the house is getting better and better with the digital marketing and our leadership brand strategy has been paying dividends so to do more of that in places where we re highly underdeveloped makes all the sense in the world to us and asia and europe are two clear and obvious focus areas we have good infrastructure we have the right brands the right consumer markets like the chinese thing i just described most of the european markets we re active in but frankly could have a bigger footprint so this is an area where we would like to see action in the future and in the second phase of the transformation that i alluded to in my comments we re very excited about our international prospects bob labick cjs securities analyst all right super thank you so much julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you bet bob operator we will now take our next question from chris carey of bank of america please go ahead chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning julien r mininberg chief executive officer director good morning chris chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst so i know we re early days right and it sounds like we re going to get a broader strategy overview at the investor day but as we start to think about fiscal 20 would you envision being able to grow core sales next year given the tough comps especially in the first half of the year does that international component that you just mentioned in phase 2 become necessary in order to get that lift and then just any update that you have on your ability to cover tariffs would also be helpful julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah sure so fiscal 20 we ll give guidance in april which is our traditional window before that so we won t i know everyone s looking for it and i m sure everyone wants to know exactly what the fiscal 20 forecast is for the company when we re not going to be able to provide that at the end of the third quarter call i don t think so many companies do that and we would give that guidance in april in terms of the very big picture on fiscal 20 we do believe that we can continue growing history is on our side we have a good track record on that subject and we have the building blocks that said we are working through our budget cycle right now this is exactly the time of year for this we re right in the thick of it and we ll have a lot more to say in april in terms of the quarterly comparisons i know a lot of people focus on right like this quarter last quarter the last half we had a spectacular first half to the year and we re going to bring in a year between 3 8 and 4 8 growth for the year and that s on top of the 5 9 last year and the growth from the year before that the story goes on and on i guess my point is we think in years when we forecast and we think in five year chunks when we strategize and phase 2 is a five year thought and our guidance is always in one year chunks and we ll do that again in terms of the first half therefore we re not so worried about whether we ll be able to anniversary in one particular quarter or another in fact in q4 after you ve all done the math already you ll see that with the guidance that we just gave will give us very strong year in fact stronger than we originally forecasted at the beginning of the year it turned out to be that a lot of that has come in the first half we just add another 2 4 of net sales this quarter and we ll get a 3 8 to 4 8 year so everybody realizes that that means that the tough compare in the fourth quarter because of the cold and flu season doesn t give you all the growth in all the quarters so we re not worried about that i know the market gets upset on such things but our businesses are lumpy seasons are lumpy and you can never predict all these things that s why we don t give quarterly guidance in the first place and then in the case of the multi year plan i don t want to make too many promises about the long term future but we have given long term guidance and it s our intention over a many year period to be in line with that guidance brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer i think you had a second question on tariffs chris that i can start on and maybe julien can add too if he wants our pricing actions are intended to offset the full amount of gross profit dollar impact from tariff increases that doesn t mean we ll be 100 successful and as we called out in the prepared remarks it could have some impact on consumption and customer orders which we believe what happened in the short term but in the long term we would expect stability and no remaining issues the so in a perfect world if we were able to get all the price increases in place they are designed to offset 100 of the gross profit impact dollar impact we are not stopping there though we have put in place preliminary mitigation actions with respect to sourcing and are continuing a lot of those actions because some of those take a longer period of time to get into place so we ve started that process and i think you know as a result of the whole tariff thing there ll be a rebalancing in our sourcing structure and it ll be more fairly balanced in some other regions other than china which is probably a healthy result to begin with because we ll have more of our supply closer to the us and have shorter lead times and we ll have a diversified sourcing base and maybe in some cases we ll be dual sourced we ll have the same product made partially in mexico for instance and in china potentially so i think i ve said it before the sourcing action would hopefully be viewed as icing on the cake or gravy on top of the pricing action that we re taking so i just want to be clear the intention is to offset 100 we may not get totally there but i feel very good that we re going to get a high percentage of the tariffs offset and then any sourcing actions would be kind of icing on the cake chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah julien r mininberg chief executive officer director i think you ve got it the only add i d build is never waste a good crisis when there s an opportunity to take a look in the mirror look in our footprint so when you think about phase two of our plan and ask how we think the various categories and geographies will end and then relook at what our sourcing footprint is and the current tariff structure as well as opportunities to shorten lead times and the other things that brian mentioned it creates a chance to just put a bright light on plans we ve already had make some adjustments and reoptimize so that s exactly what s happening in helen of troy chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it very helpful and then just one quick follow up and i ll get back in so it strikes me that the market has been so volatile and weak to some extent i wonder if that s improved your negotiating power when you think about your ability to do m a and how you re thinking about the ability to maybe get better prices on some of the deals that you found that you think are attractive thank you julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you re talking about m a or you re talking about sourcing when you ask that chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst sorry that this would be specifically your m a strategy your ability to get assets potentially at better pricing or not and then just broadly any updates on your deployment of capital toward that end thanks julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah okay let s just start with a big picture on deployment of capital it hasn t come up yet in the call but i m sure everybody saw in our press release and heard in the comment we made a statement last quarter and we were trying to be very clear with the market at 122 90 we saw our stock is a strong buy and we bought it we bought 800 000 shares a little bit more actually and in years we have not made a bigger buyback than this with the exception of the tender offer a few years ago so there s a message in there and that buyback is good for the math as well that said our primary capital strategy remains acquisition and you probably saw that even though we took on the 100 million worth of expense we also reduced our debt by 85 million sorry the low 80s ph million during the quarter and our ratio is now 1 4 so not only operationally are we in the best place we ve ever been on the subject of acquisition but financially we are poised in terms of looking for assets that we ve been aggressive on the subject i think we ve told various people in various discussions various versions of the same but it all comes down to the common theme which is we re a bit picky to make sure that we have the right asset it s not so much about price it s about fix and quality of asset as opposed to how accretive and how much would we pay and how we finance our balance sheet is more than able to finance the stuff that we re looking at and in terms of the picky i just wanted to say that there s a few really good ones actually that looked on the surface to the point where we engaged engaged heavily but once you get under the hood there s enough hair on them that i think you d be disappointed if we buy them and frankly we were not going to go further so we never got all the way to the point where it was you re going to get the best possible price in the market there i think we could have bought any of those assets and we were willing to do so if it was right for us and on pricing i don t know if jack or brian you might have something on that brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer well i was just going to add that i think it s too early to see any reflection in the prices from the recent stock market volatility so we have not seen that yet but i would attribute that to just being too soon to have those reflected in pricing yet chris carey bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much for all that julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you bet chris operator we will now take our next question linda ann bolton weiser from d a davidson please go ahead linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst hi how are you julien r mininberg chief executive officer director hi linda nice to hear from you happy new year linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst happy new year so i believe that on the last call when you were giving us a really good rundown of all the tariff impacts and everything i think you said the worst case scenario impact on profit growth in fy 20 would be like 5 percentage points if i m recollecting correctly so what you re saying now is that you re actually hoping to offset with pricing all of the impact so brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer yeah i don t linda it s brian i think we gave dollar unmitigated dollar ranges and we had to give two ranges one for whether the last round stayed at 10 or went to 25 so we i never put it in percentage point terms and i couldn t tell you off the cuff what the percentages are we gave dollar ranges and that was we tried to be clear and say that was 100 unmitigated just to give people some perspective on it and because we hadn t completed our negotiations on pricing or explored all our other mitigation options we re now much further along with respect to pricing and i m saying that the intention is to offset 100 of the tariff increases through pricing and have try to say it s no guarantee that we will get completely there and there could be an impact on consumption and customer orders in the short term but yes in a way to think about it is the goal is to offset a 100 of the gross dollar impact through the pricing and then pick up additional wins if we can in sourcing julien r mininberg chief executive officer director and on the sourcing side well it s not as straightforward as ok let s work on the price we can work backwards into our supply chain we put this in our prepared remarks as well with productivity initiatives we have them internally always externally always as well but there s some specific ones that we are pursuing in china and in mexico that create opportunity and some savings to help mitigate and then both commodities and foreign exchange move around but they move in our favor frankly when commodity costs come down for example you ve seen the price of oil over the last few months you ve seen the price of copper over the last two months in the form various forms of plastic which we use and lots of things with motors and metal windings that use copper these are opportunities to gain back some ground on the subject ph of pricing or hold off increases that might come from a supplier who s facing themselves some increase on commodities that are going in the wrong direction like cardboard for example for cartons and it s well known that carton is an escalating commodity and then in terms of foreign exchange the rmb has been weaker than the us dollar for some time now triggered or exacerbated anyway by the trade war and some of that broader macroeconomic china slowdown and when we trade in dollars in china our dollars buy more rmbs and that gives an opportunity to help mitigate price differences so these kinds of things and as before you get into factory moves removing sku between chinese factories let alone multi regional moves like under the new nafta law so there s lots of stuff that s not just putting out a price sheet linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst thank you that s very helpful and then when you talk about just a possibility of consumption or order declines or softening because of the price increases can you give a little more color on which categories because i think of your stuff as mostly smaller gadgetry type things that i wouldn t think that consumer is so price sensitive over so what are you referring to and are you more referring to competition still being able to not take the pricing for you like what are you talking about in terms of consumption decline due to these price increases julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah just to be clear we re not anticipating consumption declines our products provide an excellent value they re generally the leaders in the market they have some of the best attributes the best quality the best brand names the best features our products are winners consumers know that and you can see it in the online ratings you can see it in our market shares and you can see it in our premium that we often command as compared to competitors in the category so we re very confident in the value equation that we give we also are confident that the us consumer has a lot of tailwind right now those things i ve mentioned in the prepared remarks taxes are generally lower depending exactly which person situation there s more people with jobs you saw the labor reports last week and all three of the major indicators went positive i m talking about the number of jobs that were created the wage growth of the people who had jobs and the labor participation rate which means are just more people are working so all those things put money in people s pockets and now they go to the shelf but for the first time in years they ll see products that have a bit of inflation in them and there has not been inflation in this country of any meaningful way in the last couple of years and certainly not in our categories there s plenty of competition out there but i don t think they all can say the same positive things i said about our products some of them are excellent some of them are less so and customers have alternatives and consumers do too it s a competitive marketplace that is yet to be tested and that s the only comment we re really trying to make to see at the new price points that retailers may choose to put on their shelves what consumer response will be so if you pick something of a low dollar value to your point before about gadgetry type of item pick a carrot peeler or a can opener or something that s 10 12 item when it comes from us there s always been 3 to 5 alternatives in a discount store that has nothing to do with tariff nothing to do with pricing it s just always been true that said if our item now let s say goes up 1 and the other one only goes up 0 25 that relative equation has not been retested and it s also possible to cross a price point like let s say something crosses the 10 price point or the 25 price point or under more extensive expensive items like an air purifier it might cross the 200 or 250 price point something like this and so at some point consumers have an opinion about what they re willing to buy and how much they re willing to spend how much money they ve got in their pocket et cetera i saw christmas is very encouraging on this subject and while all the numbers haven t been published yet from christmas i think it s well known that the christmas season was generally positive and consumers demonstrated with their wallets that they are willing to spend that money that s in their pocket to buy the things that they want and so when prices go up a little now it ll be retested of whether there s any new normal in the new equations when prices move around that s all we re saying linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst okay and then just can i follow up on the m a topic we know that you ve been generally successful with m a and have done a great job especially for things like hydro flask but i m just wondering with what we re looking at possibly in terms of china s slowdown seeping over into the us are you considering in your mind maybe just keeping your balance sheet really clean and keeping your powder dry and just not doing something for now and not levering up because maybe investors might value at this point having a really clean unleveraged balance sheet and that might be the best thing to do in other words i m just wondering should you lever up right ahead of a potential recession that s what i m kind of wondering julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah it s a great question we do debated internally sometimes that very safe route look at our leverage ratio it s low and it just got lower look at our stock buyback behavior there s been about 1 2 million shares repurchased by us just within this fiscal year alone and we brought the leverage down so that strategy creates value and that said operationally it when we find the right asset even with some of those larger macro concerns we should be able to add value to the asset in any reasonable economic environment in a tougher one like you re concerned about if there s a recession or contagion or something like that everything certainly gets harder on the one hand on the other hand the winners tend to win in those recessions and we ve seen that before in the last recession especially in health home for example it was an area where we just got stronger and i guess my point is if we find the right thing i think we would move forward if there s massive macro data that says caution all around it would make us a bit more cautious but our balance sheet and our operations are ready and if we find the right asset we would act on it and yet we re keenly aware of the environment you re talking about meanwhile as i ve said many times in many in meetings the money has not been burning a hole in our in our pocket we have not made a significant purchase of any asset since 2016 and this is at the hydro flask acquisition and since then we ve been aggressive with the stock buybacks especially when the market looked at us and didn t see much value we thought they were crazy and we saw tons of value so we bought back the stock so we re not afraid to go both ways as they say and we ll do the right thing not only for the balance sheet but for our portfolio and our operations with a sharp eye on the macro horizon brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer i would just add that we ve always had a conservative approach to leverage and we would never lever above i don t know pick the number 4 times leverage or something like that so i think we would if we were going to do something we would choose to minimize our risk through not taking on a high amount of leverage and we ve always had the ability to generate a lot of cash to quickly delever so that for those reasons we would consider an acquisition even if we felt like there was some recessionary signs but we wouldn t do it so aggressively that we ended up with ultra high leverage ratio and we ve always had the ability to delever quickly which would help i think even in a recessionary environment we would still be able to delever quickly so for those reasons i think we would continue to consider acquisition even if the trends are totally in our favor from a macro perspective julien r mininberg chief executive officer director it could also affect pricing to the question that chris carey asked before in that kind of environment multiples and prices come down interest rates are a little higher now than they were a few years ago so all these things the market has a way of factoring them in very efficiently i think what we would not do in a very negative environment is bet the farm so you re not going to see swing for the fences we ve not done that really ever as a company but to go in the face of a heavy negative macroeconomic environment and bet the ranch we re not that smart and not that stupid at the same time i don t think we would do that linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst thanks and can i just ask one little quick one what percentage of your total sales are in china and what percent of your e commerce sales are in china julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah we don t break it out it s been growing rapidly i can say that it s been very successful for us as market leadership and those thermometers has been true for some time the rapid growth has been exceptional we ve had an internal project to grow by multiples in the last couple of years we ve exceeded it i can give you lots of qualitative indicators that say that this is a winning area if you re worried about the slowdown try and look into dimensionalize which i think is what you re really trying to do the number brian gave before which is of the 10 million of reduction which is only to the high end of our guidance is to be technical difficulty repetitive i m sorry but we see the market doesn t like it when we lower guidance but raise our earnings they may forget that this is going to be a 3 8 to 4 8 growth year and in china we re actually going to have an up year yet again we re just going to have less up year than we originally forecasted because of this brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer linda i what we can disclose is our percentage of sales in the asia pacific region last fiscal year was 5 1 of our total but growing rapidly so i would expect that number to be higher for fiscal year 19 but we give that breakout annually but just as a starting point it s 5 1 of the total in the asia pacific region for last fiscal year and it grew 25 last fiscal year and is continuing to grow this year julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah and then on the online side it s not the lion share of our online we do a lot more online in the united states it s just a large part of the chinese business is online so that s the reason we made that distinction so if that business that brian just described with numbers has tendency ph of online that s been its biggest growth driver if that slows down a little bit it s not surprising then our forecast takes a hit in that 5 million ish that we re talking about i m frankly surprised we re having such a discussion about 5 million ish linda ann bolton weiser d a davidson analyst okay thank you so much i really appreciate it julien r mininberg chief executive officer director you bet linda operator we will now take our next question from steve marotta of c l king and associates please go ahead steven louis marotta cl king associates analyst good morning julien and brian i know we re running over so i ll just offer two quick questions and take the rest offline from a sourcing rebalancing standpoint can you remind us where you are right now from a china exposure to cogs domestically and where you d expect to be 12 months from now julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah brian i believe we breakout the total number and while he is going to dig it up for you steve we ll give you that number because we do disclose it while he is doing and i ll remind it s true that it varies a lot by segments so in the case of beauty and housewares we re primarily china sourced in the case of health home we re roughly even in dollar terms between china and the americas with mexico being the primary source for the americas products so think of thermometers humidifiers air purifiers vaporizers a lot of this stuff is made in mexico for them brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer so is that ph right currently 70 well for last fiscal year 74 of our product was sourced in the far east and i would say at this stage it s hard to give an estimate on how we could shift that percentage because we re early days in looking at new regions and auctions it s not like we didn t look at it in the past but in the past the analysis always proved out that china was by far the most efficient julien r mininberg chief executive officer director and the numbers moved numbers moved the lines have recrawled as a new equilibrium brian l grass cfo principal accounting officer right so now they shifted because of tariffs and because china is becoming more expensive the lines are starting to cross so that in conjunction with the massive impact from tariffs has got us looking at this harder and the analysis shows that it s getting closed to equal or maybe even the lines are crossing so it s early days steve i can t i don t think it would be prudent for us to give you what we think it could be in a year at this stage i think there will be more to come on that in the next couple of quarters we re at 74 currently julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah the way and the way looking forward the way i would look at it and the way we look at it internally is health home is roughly at 50 50 the company has the balance that you just heard in last fiscal year and for housewares and beauty it s almost completely china with the lines moving think of things like labor rates the chinese labor rates has been going up almost like clockwork for the last seven or eight years now 15 20 a year it s not that big a component of our cost of goods but compound that over seven eight year period labor gets to be more expensive exchange rates if you look at the rmb versus the dollar over the last seven or eight years and the mexican peso versus the dollar over the last seven years you re going to see two entirely different scenarios and then if you look at lead times inventory levels and then cube meaning like let s say so you re making a thing like a vaporizer or salad spinner so that s a big item they re roughly the same size they re very light so you re going to cube out a container across the pacific long before you gross it out with weight and the lead time is longer so why would you ship all that air and yet fill up that container that you could put more weight in filling it up with something else like thermometer or a hair dryer something like that you re going to be able to get a lot more units and a lot more dollar value in that container before you cube it out or gross it out so this stuff is all being factored into equation because it s all moving around and because the rule of law has changed right nafta 2 or at usmca is i don t know if it s a done deal but appears closely to ratification and in the case of the china thing i believe the delegations are meeting this week as we speak on the subject of whether or not there s going to be a new normal coming out of china and meanwhile there s also new congress in the united states that you wanted to fight about everything so i can t tell you how all that s going to go i could simply tell you that s the way we look at it my response is very simple never waste a good crisis i said it before and when the numbers move around it creates opportunity we re capitalists and we re going to put our assets where we think they re most efficient and get the best value we can for our shareholders and make the best margins we can in our business steven louis marotta cl king associates analyst that s great thank you i ll take the rest offline julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah no problem operator it appears there are no further questions at this time mr mininberg i d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks julien r mininberg chief executive officer director yeah well thanks for joining today robust discussion very much appreciated look forward

kiplinger s personal finance magazine wall street s analysts and market experts have scores of unique investing ideas and perspectives as we begin the new year but one common thought across dozens of 2019 market outlooks nothing will come easy for investors where will the american stock market go in 2019 what sectors will shine and which ones will fall to the back of the pack will chinese equities rebound will cryptocurrencies find their way back into favored status among aggressive investors experts from across the spectrum from wall street s most prominent stock analysis outfits to boutique shops that specialize in just one or two corners of the market have delivered their market outlooks for 2019 kiplinger s has published its own insights our economic outlook and our guide on where to invest for the year but we suggest also taking in the analyst community s views on stocks bonds and beyond digest these key 2019 market outlooks to find investment ideas that fit your portfolio in the new year they include price targets for the standard poor s 500 stock index economic forecasts and various investing strategies u s gdp only partial steam ahead focus u s economy expert jpmorgan asset management first we ll set the stage with jpmorgan asset management s 2019 investment outlook specifically its thoughts on u s economic growth in the coming year entering 2019 the u s economy looks remarkably healthy with a recent acceleration in economic growth unemployment near a 50 year low and inflation still low and steady in july 2019 the expansion should enter its 11th year making this the longest u s expansion in over 150 years of recorded economic history however a continued soft landing in the form of a slower but still steady non inflationary expansion into 2020 will require both luck and prudence from policy makers jpmorgan s analysts do see real gdp slowing in 2019 for four reasons first the fiscal stimulus from tax cuts enacted late last year will begin to fade second higher mortgage rates and a lack of pent up demand should continue to weigh on the very cyclical auto and housing sectors third under our baseline assumptions the trade conflict with china worsens entering 2019 with a ratcheting up of tariffs to 25 on usd 200 billion of u s goods even if the conflict does not escalate further higher tariffs would likely hurt u s consumer spending and the uncertainty surrounding trade could dampen investment spending finally a lack of workers could increasingly impede economic activity with the unemployment rate now well below 4 0 a lack of available workers may constrain economic activity particularly in the construction retail food services and hospitality industries this theme of caution and prudence peppers many experts market outlooks to come slowing but still growing earnings to propel u s stocks focus u s stocks s p 500 target expert bofa merrill lynch bofa merrill lynch like jpmorgan asset management expects the u s economy s growth to slow and sees a similar fate for american corporate earnings nonetheless their stock market outlook for 2019 is positive with an s p 500 price target that implies double digit growth ahead the standard and poor s 500 index is expected to peak at or slightly above 3 000 before settling in at a year end target of 2 900 which would be a 15 7 gain for the year based on 2018 s closing readout of 2 506 85 earnings growth also is likely to slow in the u s though the near term outlook remains somewhat positive we forecast earnings per share eps growth of 5 percent which would put the s p 500 eps at a record high of 170 next year where will that growth come from our u s equity strategists are overweight health care technology utilities financials and industrials and underweight consumer discretionary communication services and real estate higher markets but no earnings bonanza focus u s stocks s p 500 target expert sam stovall chief investment strategist cfra cfra s sam stovall sets a stern tone about the outlook for both 2019 share price returns and u s corporate earnings though he does set a higher price target for the s p 500 than bofa merrill lynch s analysts after illustrating 2018 s strength in gdp growth and s p 500 profits he writes yet to quote the old milwaukee beer commercials of years past it just doesn t get any better than this indeed a tailing off of the trend is the theme for 2019 as global gdp growth along with s p 500 eps face stiffer comparisons cfra s investment policy committee is lowering its 12 month projected target for the s p 500 to 2975 from the current 3100 based on the median forecast of ipc members stovall wrote on dec 10 implying 13 from the s p 500 s dec 7 close and 18 7 upside from the end of 2018 we see few opportunities for economic stimulation as a result of tighter monetary policy and the new congressional make up indeed history reminds us that the s p 500 posted a below average 12 month price gain of 6 2 in the 12 months following the end of rate tightening cycles in the past 65 years as compared with the average 8 7 advance for all years cfra s outlook for earnings is equally hesitant lastly the tax cut s boost to 2018 s eps will not be repeated in 2019 at the beginning of 2018 s p 500 eps growth was pegged at 11 4 today it is a shade below 23 on 9 30 18 the s p 500 was projected to record eps growth of 10 in 2019 today the estimate is 7 5 we think the result will be a bit softer at 5 the end of easy focus u s stocks s p 500 target expert darrell l cronk cfa president of wells fargo investment institute wells fargo in its 2019 outlook titled the end of easy sets a target range for the s p 500 index of 2 860 2 960 implying anywhere between 14 1 and 18 1 upside for 2019 it raises no eyebrows sitting close to many other major market outlooks more notable to investors is the letter to investors from darrell l cronk cfa president of wells fargo investment institute which concisely presents some of the headwinds that loom ahead the end of cheap capital as interest rates rise from generational lows consumers and businesses will have to rationalize how rising costs of capital affect borrowing and spending decisions the end of outsized job gains multidecade tight labor conditions put upward pressure on wages making it difficult for employers to attract and retain needed talent for growth this in return should slow job growth the end of extremely low volatility across equities rates and currencies one of the hallmarks of this cycle has been the extraordinarily low volatility regimes for most major asset classes we believe that this began to change in 2018 and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2019 cronk does provide one glimmer of light however the end of equity returns driven by only a few sectors outsized investor performance has come from only a few equity sectors through much of this cycle we see the range of opportunities broadening resulting in appealing valuations across a number of equity sectors will investors drive stocks back to super premium prices focus u s stocks s p 500 target expert brad mcmillan cfa caia mai cio of commonwealth financial network the last broad market outlook featured here comes from commonwealth financial network s brad mcmillan whose 2019 look ahead includes a nod to stock valuations despite all the worries about tariffs strong economic fundamentals have allowed us to sail through the market storms and this is likely to continue to be the case with solid fundamentals the real question will be what stock valuations do historically high levels of confidence have driven valuations higher which is what we have seen through most of 2018 recently however valuations have dropped to the lower end of the range typical of the past five years or so as confidence levels moderate and growth slows we can expect valuations to remain at the lower end of that range given projected earnings growth and a resetting of valuations to levels prevailing through the past couple of years to about 15 times forward earnings the s p 500 is likely to end 2019 between 2 900 and 3 000 implying 15 7 to 19 7 upside there is upside potential if valuations recover to the high levels seen recently but there may be more downside risk as even a valuation of 15 is quite high historically still this estimate is consistent with revenue and earnings growth projections and with overall economic growth a global bear market is at least on the table focus global economy expert jeffrey kleintop senior vice president chief global investment strategist charles schwab charles schwab s jeffrey kleintop paints a gloomy picture for the global economy and international stocks for the coming year global growth may slow in 2019 as the economic cycle nears a peak with increasing drag from worsening financial conditions combining with full employment and rising prices global stock markets may peak in 2019 if leading indicators signal the gathering clouds of a global recession if we borrow the severe weather scale for storms and apply it to the global economy and markets we aren t forecasting recession warning meaning a recession is here or imminent a better term is recession watch in which conditions are favorable to a recession if a number of risk factors e g trade interest rates inflation deteriorate for all the concerns about trade policy brexit and other issues 2018 s big stock market declines generally were driven by inflation and interest rate concerns these are the indicators investors should watch most closely in 2019 historically when unemployment and inflation rates have converged to become the same number signaling an overheating economy it has marked the beginning of a prolonged downturn for the stock market followed about a year later by a recession the gap between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate is close to one percentage point in major countries like germany japan the united kingdom and the united states a couple tips from schwab consider reducing portfolio volatility by trimming historically more volatile asset classes such as emerging market stocks consider rebalancing back to long term asset allocation targets historically long term asset class trends have tended to reverse in the year prior to global recessions and bear markets this may begin to favor international over u s value over growth and large over small cap stocks central banks hold the keys to international stocks focus international stocks expert kristina hooper chief global market strategist invesco and arnab das global market strategist emea invesco most diversified portfolios are going to include some allocation to international stocks naturally then investors should be concerned with more than just s p 500 targets invesco provides its outlook on what could drive international developed and emerging markets stock returns in 2019 the us federal reserve fed is very likely to continue on its path of regular gradual rate hikes it would probably take a major downturn in economic data or a very severe us stock market correction to divert the fed from that rate hike path at this juncture in addition the european central bank ecb is due to begin winding down its own quantitative easing program from the end of 2018 which could contribute to further disruption in eurozone bond markets which are already experiencing renewed divergence in addition more emerging markets economies are tightening many doing so to keep up with the fed creating an overall environment that is less accommodative in the eurozone and japan we expect continued support of risk assets because of more accommodative monetary policy which in our view should result in modest positive stock returns for those regions despite relatively low economic growth in emerging markets em we expect the fed driven re pricing to continue to spill over into global markets through a stronger dollar higher us bond yields and tighter global financial conditions pointing to more pressure on em currencies putting downward pressure on growth and upward pressure on inflation a challenging scenario for em equities bonds and currencies however there is a significant possibility that by mid year 2019 the fed may moderate its normalization as economic growth slows which should result in some moderation in the investment implications mentioned above in our view environment for emerging markets may improve in 2019 focus emerging markets stocks expert blackrock investment institute blackrock in its outlook for emerging markets equities makes a somewhat hesitant bull case for the year ahead emerging market assets have cheapened offering better compensation for risk in 2019 country specific risks such as a series of em elections and currency crises in turkey and argentina look to be mostly behind us china is easing policy to stabilize its economy marking a sea change from 2018 s clampdown on credit growth we see the credit impulse turning positive in 2019 and fiscal policy becoming supportive other positives for the asset class the fed is closer to the end of its tightening cycle and may pause rate hikes and or balance sheet reduction in 2019 and economies are adjusting currency depreciations have led to improved current account balances in many em economies the key risk for em assets the fed tightens faster than markets anticipate renewing the dollar s uptrend and tightening financial conditions for countries with external liabilities we are cautiously positive on em assets for 2019 helen zhu head of china equities blackrock fundamental active equity said specifically about chinese stocks there s upside potential for chinese equities if fiscal and monetary stimulus goes hand in hand with growth boosting measures such as land reform other catalysts are abating trade tensions and a weaker u s dollar investing in china don t eat the whole elephant focus emerging markets stocks expert jay jacobs head of research and strategy at global x the biggest question investors face in 2019 about dipping a toe into china may not be whether to do so but how to do so jay jacobs head of research and strategy at fund provider global x says 2018 saw the introduction of chinese a shares into global benchmarks which has further increased the investable opportunity set in china and its weight in emerging market indices as the world s second largest economy though we believe that investors need to dig deeper into china and evaluate their exposure on a sector level if there was anything to be learned from the market s reaction to tariffs it s that china is not a monolith and that its sectors like any other major economy s do not move in unison whether trade risks remain prominent into 2019 or not china is 10 of the world s market cap and investors are have exposure to the nation in some form either directly or indirectly it s important that the exposure investors are getting to china be more nuanced than simply taking a whole market approach as we learned this year u s stock allocations could use a little trim focus investing strategies expert sam stovall chief investment strategist cfra cfra provides a general breakdown of how investors should allocate their portfolios in the year ahead as well as a few more specific recommendations cfra s investment policy committee recommends a 55 exposure to global equities that s u s and international stocks and a 45 weighting to fixed income we suggest reducing the exposure to u s equities to 40 from 45 while maintaining a neutral 15 exposure to foreign stocks one reason for the reduction in u s equities is that as of 12 7 18 the s p 500 has recorded an 11 6 cagr in price over the past 10 years which is above the average of 5 9 since 1918 and more than one standard deviation above the mean 11 2 during this period though not a signal of an impending top this rolling 10 year cagr implies that the bull may be running out of steam cfra thinks that foreign equities offer positive trending eps growth attractive valuations and higher yields for 2019 while the s p 500 should see slowing in eps growth the reverse is true for foreign markets both the s p developed ex us bmi broad market index and s p emerging bmi are expected to post better profit growth in 2019 than in 2018 and both the developed and emerging market benchmarks are trading at greater than 20 and 35 discounts respectively to their average relative p e versus the s p 500 over the past 15 years income investors should also remain attracted to overseas markets since they yield more than their domestic counterparts also a few notes on sector recommendations cfra advises overweights in energy utilities and information technology loving the latter for its above market 2019 eps growth expectations combined with more attractive forward relative valuations meanwhile it has underweights in financials as well as communication services saying about the latter that it will face pressure from increased social media regulatory scrutiny along with additional cable subscriber defections go large in 2019 focus stock investing strategies expert lpl financial research lpl financial research s forecast for 2019 includes gdp growth of between 2 5 and 2 75 in 2019 as well as a total return stock price performance plus dividends of 8 to 10 for the s p 500 a less bullish target than many other market outlooks needless to say in that reality investors will have to be pickier about where they take their shots lpl s thoughts on where investors might find better fortunes large vs small caps small caps generated outperformance early in 2018 aided by being relatively more insulated from trade tensions than large caps however as trade issues mitigate the business cycle ages and the dollar s uptrend potentially hits resistance market leadership may shift back toward large caps in addition a rising interest rate environment potentially with tightening financial conditions may create a challenge for small cap companies that have higher costs of capital and a greater reliance on debt accordingly over the next several months we suggest suitable investors shift toward target allocations across market capitalization with benchmark like exposures to small mid and large cap stocks growth vs value we maintain our slight preference for value despite its underperformance relative to growth in 2018 we expect value in 2019 to benefit from the pickup in economic growth that began in mid2018 relatively attractive valuations after a sustained period of growth outperformance and our positive view of financials sector investing how to stay on the balance beam focus stock investing strategies expert jpmorgan asset management the cautious tone jpmorgan set in its outlook for the u s economy continues in its view of the investing environment for 2019 investors have recognized that trees do not grow to the sky and that the robust pace of profit and economic growth seen this year will gradually fade in 2019 as interest rates move higher while history suggests that there are still attractive returns to be had in the late stages of a bull market the transition away from quantitative easing and toward quantitative tightening has contributed to broader investor concerns many equate this new environment to walking on an investment tightrope without the liquidity safety net that has been present for over a decade this leaves investors in a tough spot should they focus on a fundamental story that is softening or invest with an expectation that multiples will expand as the bull market runs it course the best answer is probably a little bit of each jpm s allocation suggestions for the new year we are comfortable holding stocks as long as earnings growth is positive but do not want to be over exposed given an expectation for higher volatility as such higher income sectors like financials and energy look more attractive than technology and consumer discretionary and we would lump the new communication services sector in with the latter names rather than the former however given our expectation of still some further interest rate increases it does not yet seem appropriate to fully rotate into defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples rather a focus on cyclical value should allow investors to optimize their upside downside capture as this bull market continues to age tech will shine again defense is getting pricey focus stock investing strategies expert michael sheldon cio and executive director at rdm financial group at hightower sheldon sees a shift away from the dynamic seen in the final quarter of 2018 during which technology was battered and investors huddled into defensive plays such as consumer staples and utility companies we believe that investors need to have some exposure within a diversified portfolio to dynamic faster growing advanced technology companies companies that operate in this area of the market are likely to be more volatile than the average company however over the next several years we believe that companies that operate in areas like cloud computing web services artificial intelligence autonomous cars and robotics are likely to generate positive growth and attractive returns heading into the new year we favor technology due to strong balance sheets positive growth characteristics and attractive valuation levels and healthcare due to a combination of both defensive and growth characteristics along with historically attractive valuation levels while some defensive areas of the market like utility and consumer staples stocks have performed better recently due to the recent pick up in volatility these parts of the market are starting to get more expensive and appear unlikely to provide investors with attractive returns looking ahead over the next several years robotics and ai the emerging tech play of 2019 focus stock investing strategies expert william studebaker president cio of robo global robo global s william studebaker discusses some of the factors in robotics and artificial intelligence raii that could help drive stocks in the technology and industrial sectors this year massive adoption of ai will transform the healthcare industry the medical field is seeing the light when it comes to the very real benefits of ai in all things healthcare machine learning is already helping physicians make smarter decisions by making it easier to view and analyze patient scans 3d printing matches medical devices to the exact specifications of patients genomic sequencing makes it possible to diagnose and treat diseases earlier than ever and robot assisted surgeries are improving surgical outcomes autonomous vehicles will deliver level 4 autonomy level 5 autonomy requires capabilities that work predictably in all environments all of the time and while that holy grail remains beyond our grasp for now level 4 autonomy which requires that self driving vehicles work in some places some of the time is ready for use in limited situations the result autonomous vehicles will begin to appear in a variety of geo constrained environments such as airports closed campuses and retirement communities laying the groundwork for wider adoption and acceptance as technology get closer and closer to level 5 winners and losers will be defined by how quickly they adopt robotics and ai sears and toys r us are just the latest examples of companies that were market leaders who failed because they failed to adapt in the new raai driven economy as robotics and ai continues to march forward winners and losers in every industry will be increasingly defined by how willing they are to evolve their processes and business models to take advantage of the latest advancements those who are unwilling or unable to make the shift will be next on the chopping block a stormy year ahead for fixed income focus bonds expert kathy jones senior vice president chief fixed income strategist charles schwab charles schwab s kathy jones believes interest rates might have hit a ceiling but that s not an all clear for the bond space the worst may be over for the bond bear market after more than two years of steadily rising bond yields and falling bond prices which move inversely to yields our research suggests that 10 year treasury bond yields may have peaked for this tightening cycle at the 3 25 level the federal reserve likely will continue to raise short term interest rates to about 3 in 2019 but we don t see longer term yields moving much above the recent highs tighter global monetary policy a strong u s dollar and sluggish global growth exacerbated by trade conflicts are likely to weigh on economic growth and inflation limiting the rise in bond yields however the path forward isn t likely to be smooth as markets adjust to tightening financial conditions volatility is likely to increase we expect the federal reserve to raise rates two to three more times bringing the federal funds target rate to the 2 75 to 3 area in early 2019 short of the federal open market committee s 3 4 median estimate for 2020 because short and long term interest rates tend to converge at cycle peaks the yield curve likely will flatten toward zero we suggest investors gradually add to average portfolio duration when yields rise as the fed normalizes rates and reduces its balance sheet volatility may increase in riskier parts of the fixed income market such as bank loans high yield and emerging market bonds due to issuers high leverage we suggest investors move up in credit quality and or limit exposure to these asset classes municipal bonds may post solid performance in 2019 as demand appears strong for tax exempt income bonds in 2019 break out the ladders focus bonds expert dan draper managing director and global head of exchange traded funds invesco powershares invesco powershares dan draper says while pressures are easing interest rates still could head higher again in 2019 the rise of trade tensions between the us and china and the ensuing tariffs have softened global growth expectations and thereby potentially eased to a degree the expected upward pressure on interest rates in both the us and asia on the other hand solid us economic growth combined with improved wage growth and low unemployment in the us support the expectation that the federal reserve will maintain the gradual pace of short term interest rate increases through 2019 but the global head of invesco s etf division has some advice for this scenario with the overall climate still tilting in the direction of higher rates in 2019 one way to potentially manage that risk is to build bond ladders using defined maturity bond funds whether domestic or international a bond ladder is a portfolio of bonds that mature at staggered intervals across a range of maturities if rates continue to rise proceeds from each maturing rung of bonds can be reinvested in longer dated bonds at higher rates defined maturity etfs can help investors build bond ladders quickly and easily with a range of bonds that can help provide diversification to a portfolio another way to help mitigate the impact of currency volatility on fixed income portfolios is to stick with us dollar denominated international bond portfolios if fixed income lags where can you turn for yield focus income generating strategies expert jay jacobs head of research and strategy at global x the federal reserve s continued rate hikes for the past couple of years have put pressure on investors in fixed income while bonds did see some significant relief late in 2018 as a safety play amid the market selloff global x s jay jacobs says a return to bond weakness could be at hand the big focus for investors in the back half of the year has been on market volatility that s been seen across asset classes although the conventional wisdom would see those investors moving their attention to the fixed income market we believe that the steady course of rising rates makes traditional fixed income assets unattractive necessitating alternative methods to generate income preferreds offer investors some of that yield with added potential tax benefits and we also see an over sold master limited partnership or mlp market as particularly attractive especially as the us continues to become a leading producer of oil and natural gas another attractive area is covered call strategies that can generate income that is tied to volatility rather than interest rates giving it little to no duration the bull case for commodities focus commodities expert bofa merrill lynch 2018 largely was a down year for commodities oil prices made the most noise with their precipitous drop but gold despite a year end revival finished the year lower too however bofa sees rosier times ahead for several commodities in 2019 the outlook for commodities is modestly positive despite a challenging global macro environment we forecast brent and wti crude oil prices to average 70 and 59 per barrel respectively in 2019 respective 2018 year end prices of 53 80 and 45 41 would imply potential annual gains of 30 1 and 25 2 at those averages weather induced volatility is expected in the near term for u s natural gas as cold weather could propel winter natural gas over 5 mmbtu million british thermal units yet we remain bearish longer term on strong supply growth natural gas closed 2018 at 2 94 per mmbtu thus bofa s outlook implies gains of as much as 70 for winter natural gas in metals we remain cautious about copper because of chinese downside risk we forecast gold prices will rise to an average of 1 296 per ounce but could rally to as high as 1 400 driven by u s twin deficits and chinese stimulus that target average price of 1 296 is a mere 1 higher than gold s 2018 close of 1 281 30

interview with france inter interview with benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by ali baddou and alexandra bensaid and broadcast on 4 january 2019 thank you for taking the time to talk to us here at france inter before returning to your office at the ecb in frankfurt the ecb the european central bank plays a prominent role in the lives of europeans in our day to day lives and yet we don t always know what you are doing in your ultra modern tower in frankfurt if you had to explain the ecb in just a few words say to a high school student we currently have a number of high school interns here at france inter who are listening this morning what would you say mr cœuré the ecb is actually two towers in frankfurt because we do two different things we look after the euro we ensure the stability of the euro the purchasing power of the euro which has just celebrated its 20th anniversary which has just celebrated its 20th anniversary yes the ecb was established in july 1998 and the euro on 1 january 1999 so on the one hand we decide on monetary policy for the 19 countries of the euro area to ensure the stability and purchasing power of the euro and on the other we supervise european banks these are two different jobs in two different locations in frankfurt did everything change at the ecb after the 2008 crisis yes it is fair to say everything changed the crisis accelerated the ecb s shift towards a model more similar to those of other central banks around the world such as the us federal reserve or the bank of england it was a dramatic event traumatising but it was a kind of coming of age for our institution do you also and this is also a question for our high school students monitor the techniques used by counterfeiters for example those who print fake euros yes and this is really important because money seems to be a very abstract topic take the macroeconomy and percentages for example but it s also a very real issue we do a lot of plumbing at the ecb we manage banknotes coordinating their printing and preparation as well as their design with security features as you know a new series of banknotes is currently being introduced the 50 banknote was issued recently and will be followed by the 100 and 200 banknotes soon and you re withdrawing the 500 banknote from circulation exactly we re no longer printing the 500 banknote because it has become too popular for money laundering purposes and other unsavoury uses so we re stopping it a great deal of our time is also occupied by payments all the techniques used to transfer money from one account to another just a month ago we launched a real time payment system which allows all euro area banks if they want to make person to person transfers within a matter of seconds there s a second thing i wanted to ask you what is qe or quantitative easing it s incomprehensible to the general public but it s a staggering programme over the past few years ecb traders your traders have purchased 2 5 trillion in public and private debt the programme has been halted what purpose did it serve yes that s right over four years between 2015 and 2018 our last net purchases were made a few days ago just before christmas we bought european public and private debt amounting to 2 6 trillion why it s very simple to reduce the cost of financing in the euro area the central banks they teach this in high school steer the overnight interest rate but this is not sufficient as firms borrow over a period of three five ten years so the three year five year and ten year interest rates also need to be lowered to do this we buy government bonds and this has considerably improved financing conditions which in turn boosts consumption and investment in the euro area 2 5 trillion mr cœuré you say this has given a boost to consumption and investment but ultimately if we look at growth all this money quite frankly doesn t seem at least to people in france to have gone to them into their pockets into a rebounding economy of course it s gone to them through all the mechanisms that make the economy work lowering interest rates for lending to companies which we did not only in france and germany but also in greece italy and everywhere in the euro area has boosted investment by boosting investment and consumption we create jobs just to give you a figure since 2013 almost ten million jobs have been created in the euro area in terms of the level of employment we have now returned to a level higher than that before the 2008 crisis and that s partly largely in no small part due to monetary policy and in this regard mr cœuré we re going to experience we ve just experienced a big turning point you ve said you re going to stop this quantitative easing policy this policy of injecting liquidity to boost the economy does this mean that interest rates will rise for french people and when no we re not stopping it but we ve stopped increasing it you mentioned this figure of 2 5 trillion it s going to stay at this level but it will not decrease so it cannot be said that monetary policy is more restrictive in addition the short term interest rates that the ecb controls directly are going to stay at their current level i e at zero and even below zero at least through the summer of 2019 and for as long as required for inflation to return towards 2 which is our aim so interest rates will remain low for a long time yet you re currently making a major turnaround the same thing is also happening in the united states while growth is already slowing down it isn t a major turnaround it s an adjustment which is justified by the fact that this programme was launched in 2015 when the euro area was on the edge of a precipice faced with the risk of deflation we re no longer in this situation at all it s true that growth is slowing down but it is still around 1 5 in the euro area whereas at the time it had been zero so this allows for an adjustment but interest rates will remain very very low for a long time yet the euro has celebrated its 20th anniversary did you celebrate at the european central bank no one doesn t really celebrate a currency besides we have work to do we have had a dinner and we will have a conference in sintra in portugal in june to discuss what has worked and what hasn t worked with a broad range of participants what hasn t worked since it s time to reflect on the past 20 years i would say the euro as a currency has been a huge success it s stable inflation has been considerably lower in the last 20 years than in the decades before that and this has supported purchasing power it has supported the purchasing power of europeans really yes really that s really the opposite of what every single person thinks namely that since the euro prices have shot up why do you say this mr cœuré there are purchasing power issues problems with wages problems with wage distribution that s why people are taking to the streets and that s true for many countries in europe and beyond everyone thinks that life has become more expensive since the euro but this isn t linked to price inflation price inflation since 1999 has been 1 6 on average if you look at the 20 years before that before the euro was created inflation was 4 but why do people have this perception of reality is everyone crazy no i think it s due to people comparing prices in euro with prices in francs for those who can still remember prices in francs as time goes on they will become fewer and fewer there are a lot of young people who don t remember prices in francs apparently 54 of french people still mentally convert euros into francs they re remembering prices from 1999 prices from 20 years ago you can t compare today s prices with prices from 20 years ago in other words even if we d kept the franc there would have been inflation and that s what people are not seeing you say that purchasing power ultimately isn t an inflation problem which would eat away at french people s budgets you spoke about wages do wages need to rise throughout europe we re seeing dissatisfaction frustration and feelings of injustice when it comes to matters of income and distribution of income but ultimately what distributes wages is growth and productivity and so the priority for all countries in europe including france is to have an economy that creates productivity gains and allows wealth to be distributed and this is what enables wages to be distributed wage growth without productivity gains isn t good for the economy the european central bank is an unelected institution that appears to be extremely far removed from citizens you re criticised for being essentially responsible for a form of democratic hold up an expression used by journalist jean quatremer you re taking away budgetary sovereignty the euro area is described as being under german sovereignty you ve invested absolutely huge sums in saving banks and the financial system but it s european people who have paid the price with taxes strict policies the list is endless what would you say in defence of your institution mr cœuré i ve read jean quatremer s book il faut achever l euro now when he speaks of the democratic hold up he s not talking about the ecb but about european institutions and the way the euro functions in general and it s true i agree with him there s a democratic deficit in the way the euro area functions look at the discussion with greece extremely painful measures have been discussed for the greek economy for the greek people and this discussion was between the greek minister and the other 18 finance ministers it never went to the european parliament so there is a problem but it s not the ecb ok but the ecb formulates monetary policy that does not depend on governments or citizens but considerably influences the economic policies and day to day lives of european citizens that s true but what allows the ecb to be independent is its very narrow very clear very simple and very precise mandate which is to bring the inflation rate back towards 2 this is how we are judged and we are accountable to the european parliament we go everywhere i visit high schools go to conferences i discuss with people we are on twitter we re in dialogue with european citizens and with france inter and with france inter which is important as it allows me to explain all of these things yes we are bureaucrats in frankfurt but this independence is possible and technocrats and technocrats this independence is possible because we have a very narrow mandate which can be monitored the rest of the system is political and requires democratic accountability you re a left winger mr cœuré but despite that you won t get rid of the idea that some people have of you that you re investing huge sums in saving banks money which could have been used for social policies for example or for investments directly benefiting citizens day to day lives no that s not true first my political opinions have nothing to do with my job as a central banker which is not a political role and second the 2 6 trillion we ve invested that s political why did we do it we did it because we were on the brink of deflation we brought inflation back towards 2 we created ten million jobs and if it s good for employment it s also good for european citizens in the united states the federal reserve has two mandates inflation and full employment yes and if you were to add full employment in one respect it s not up to me to discuss this i cannot decide on my own mandate that s up to the parliament it s a political discussion but honestly over the last five ten years this wouldn t have changed anything everything we do creating liquidity buying securities cutting interest rates to zero is to support both output and inflation so we would have done the same thing today this debate is largely theoretical mr cœuré reflecting on the yellow vests movement in france i d also like your opinion on that citizens in italy too have been calling for budgetary constraints to be loosened budgetary constraints are governed by the maastricht treaty 3 budget deficit and maximum 60 public debt do these rules need to be reviewed i don t think my answer is going to make me very popular on your show go on i think these are good rules france has almost never complied with them i find it a little strange to complain about rules you ve never adhered to france has not balanced its budget since the 1970s as you know yes but when budgets are tightened one says those are the maastricht rules they haven t been complied with but clearly at the moment cuts are being made at every level i completely understand that people feel hard done by when it comes to redistribution and that s also an economic efficiency issue there is a redistribution problem but i don t agree that the solution is more deficit and more debt redistribution is a political discussion so you don t agree but we are all thinking about the arm wrestling over the italian budget between a government that has just been elected and taken power and the european commission the commission actually embodied the denial of universal suffrage do you appreciate the difference there yes i do but the mechanism has worked in fact it s worked well the european commission expressed its point of view based on european rules then there was a discussion a negotiation between pierre moscovici and the italian finance minister and an agreement was reached on a revised budget that was debated and voted on by the italian parliament it cannot be said that the commission was holding a knife to their throat or pointing a gun at their head really if anyone was holding a gun to their head it was the financial markets not the commission italian interest rates were rising which meant the debt burden was increasing which was bad for the italian people that wasn t europe s doing it was simply a reflection that ultimately you have to be able to finance yourself nevertheless it was in the name of these maastricht rules that in 2011 2012 austerity was imposed on europe and the growth that had begun to take hold dropped off again yes that may have been excessive it s all about finding the right balance i don t disagree with you on this but i don t think it s good for a country like france to permanently run a deficit of over 3 simply because you have to be prepared for the next economic downturn today we are seeing growth not enough but there is some growth if we don t reduce the deficit now we won t be ready when there are real economic difficulties and it will be even more painful the next time before taking questions from listeners mr cœuré a question to you as a banker the stock markets in particular the us stock market have been falling for two weeks should we be worrying about a major financial crisis in the coming months there are many uncertainties around the global economy that are not primarily financial in nature but first and foremost linked to trade and to the tensions surrounding trade especially between the united states and china the financial markets understandably are very concerned about this because it s the whole engine of global trade that s challenged understandably you said aren t the financial markets also involved in purely speculative activity that is detached from the real economy they can see that these discussions over trade are acting as a brake on the global economy there are speculative mechanisms and amplifier effects coming on top but the root of the concerns is linked to the fact that the international relations that have supported global growth for the past 20 years are crumbling are being eroded and that s a concern for everybody questions from the audience the european central bank has poured trillions of euro into the european economy which still hasn t reached an inflation rate of 2 these trillions must have been hidden away somewhere otherwise inflation would have been much higher so who hid away these trillions of euro probably the financial markets no first of all we re not giving money to banks this is money that is lent and that returns to our balance sheet the liquidity that is created is deposited by banks overnight at the ecb so the answer to the question who is hiding this money away is that it returns to the ecb we have it moreover these deposits bear a negative interest rate so we actually earn money on them which we redistribute to the european taxpayers because our profits are distributable and returned to taxpayers and by the way this has allowed banks liquidity constraints to be loosened which has enabled them to lend more to businesses and households the ecb was able to free up billions of euro to help banks in 2008 and 2010 why couldn t it free up the same amount for the ecological transition and thereby help individual citizens for example to ensure that buildings are insulated we are doing that to a certain extent and there are many questions in the same vein of course and it s a very important topic for us a network of central banks is working on climate related issues also from the financial regulation perspective for example how can banks and financial institutions be mandated to take into account the risks linked to climate change this is also an important question we ve seen that six large french banks have been investing massively in polluting energy sources you at the ecb have supported polluting energy sources by purchasing the bonds of total and shell for example with regard to the banks this is becoming a priority area for banking supervision monitoring the risks the banks are taking by financing polluting activities as regards the ecb itself we have public and corporate debt purchase programmes among other things these programmes have enabled us to purchase green bonds issued by the french government by the european investment bank etc we are purchasing some of these bonds in fact we are purchasing a substantial amount of them around a quarter of the green bonds issued in europe have been purchased by the ecb they are on our balance sheet and we are thus directly providing climate finance so you re purchasing both total bonds and green bonds at the same time yes we re purchasing total bonds because when we purchase corporate bonds we do so precisely according to what is available in the market we don t want to distort the market structure the ecb could be asked to add a climate objective to its price stability objective but that would be getting into a political discussion why climate over equality over employment this is a political question we can t decide it for ourselves first i would just like to comment on what mr cœuré said about salary increases being linked to growth and productivity gains for years productivity gains were huge and it was shareholders who benefited more than workers and employees but my question is the following why does the ecb not finance governments directly as was done in the 1970s before mr giscard d estaing intervened and forced the french government to finance itself on the financial markets it s much less restrictive in the united states for example where they can finance themselves through the us central bank this gives much more room for manoeuvre as the government is being financed by its central bank rather than the markets as mr cœuré just mentioned we understood your question but first we need you to explain something when a government for example the french government needs money where does it borrow that money from when a government needs money it borrows it on the financial markets which in reality means it borrows from institutional investors many of which are in fact french more specifically we re talking about the savings of french citizens funds and insurers life insurance is invested in government bonds the french government can t borrow directly from the european central bank no it can t borrow directly from the european central bank since 2015 as we discussed we have been making purchases on the secondary market after public debt securities have been issued by the governments but we are only doing this to a limited extent and we have imposed an upper limit on these purchases 2 5 trillion that s quite the upper limit unfortunately there s a lot more debt in europe we have imposed an upper limit on our purchases we would not purchase more than one third of a single government s debt could the ecb lend directly to governments no this is forbidden by the eu treaties even before 1974 we didn t do it the famous giscard decrees ratified an already existing situation it s been a long time since france borrowed money or financed itself by printing money before 1974 even and the idea that the united states could finance itself directly by printing money is also a myth it isn t true the us government borrows on the financial markets the fed the us central bank does not lend to the us government it doesn t lend a single cent to the us government france s public debt has reached 100 but on the markets we re still borrowing at very low rates we ve reached a symbolic milestone mr cœuré is it really that serious yes it s serious because the direction of travel is serious france is a country that is really struggling to get its deficit below 3 its debt is at 100 if the deficit stays above 3 the debt will then mechanically be above 100 and at some point one will find it increasingly difficult to borrow on the markets today it is not too serious because thanks to the ecb s monetary policy rates are very low but one has to prepare oneself for situations when the rates will be higher especially if there is no more growth the debt burden will begin to crowd out all the government s other budgetary expenditure it s not normal for the debt burden to crowd out spending on healthcare justice or education it s not normal it s what the future has in store for us if we don t reduce the deficit who decides this we re talking about budgetary policy so it s the french government not the ecb in his new year s address the french president declared that ultraliberal capitalism is nearing its end this is something of a prophecy and a little difficult to understand what does it mean to you i don t want to try to interpret the words of the french president how i would put it is that there is a certain vision of unbridled globalisation with no restrictions particularly on financial transactions and the international capital markets and with no real control of finance this vision has been shown to have failed this has been clear since 2007 08 and we are still dealing with the consequences but we re still there we re still there there s shadow banking there are the effects of speculation that are more significant now than ever yes is the crisis machine still there the crisis machine is still there there will be other financial crises we haven t done everything that could be done in terms of financial regulation especially in the area of shadow banking but also in terms of banking regulation we might even be turning the dial back as the financial crisis recedes further into the past bad habits are creeping back in the lobbies are reasserting themselves there is a whole movement to deregulate finance once again we really have to resist it could 2019 be a new crisis year is it a big concern that china s economy is slowing we hope not and we don t foresee it because global growth remains strong even in the euro area as a whole and in france specifically growth is still comfortable we are no longer in recession there is no need to overreact but it s true that there is a slowdown caused by worries surrounding trade and as you say there is still the risk of a financial crisis we have to be very vigilant mr cœuré could you possibly say something to make us fall in love with europe again we re living through a period when globalisation is being reshaped europe is our most powerful weapon because we will do better together we will be better placed to negotiate with the united states china and russia if we do so together rather than in isolation we must take full advantage of all the tools we have available at the european level we aren t doing enough we have to do better thank you benoît cœuré for talking to us here at france inter for answering our questions candidly and for taking on the role of educator and explaining your work we wish you a safe trip back to frankfurt and a happy new year thank you and a very happy new year
responding to mitt romney s bashing of president trump in the washington post tucker carlson criticized our elites for being self serving uninterested in serious policy fixes and unable to admit they are wrong about a host of issues tucker focused on the chasm between elites policy priorities corporate tax cuts and keeping the u s military in syria and working americans policy priorities our leaders don t care we are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long term obligation to the people they rule said carlson he criticized the republican party for seeking to make the world safe for banking while simultaneously prosecuting even more foreign wars carlson said middle america is in crisis people aren t happy and cheaper iphones won t do the trick carlson noted one of the biggest lies is that you can separate economics from things that matter like family faith and culture he went on to talk about the crisis of american family breakdown and how that is intertwined with working class men s stagnant wages culture and economics are inseparably intertwined carlson said it s all the working class s fault carlson really hit a nerve the ladies on the view and cnn s brian stelter bashed carlson as a neanderthal for saying women want marriageable men which is partly why stagnant working class male wages are a problem never trump national review writer david french took issue with carlson s monologue too his response article begins carlson accurately identifies certain maladies but they are maladies that public policy can t cure french argues the economy is basically fine for everyone so doing the right thing and making good choices will lead to good outcomes ergo if you suffer from flat wages family breakdown or poverty it is entirely your own fault then french claims manufacturing jobs haven t really disappeared and says marriage is not a luxury it is a ticket to affluence in other words the poor and working class are relatively less well off because they choose not to marry overall french says carlson s plea is just another example of a populists elevation of the political over the personal french then countered carlson s point that policymakers are ignoring america s working class by noting that america gives a lot to charity yet absolutely none of the trends french highlights are solely due to the free market or an amalgamation of individuals choices all are negatively influenced by public policy and could be positively influenced by thoughtful public policy french is wrong about family breakdown for starters french s claims about charity being equivalent to a public policy focus is a straw man some charitable organizations can be entirely self serving and even the best charity is hard pressed to replace the bedrock of civil society our families carlson knows americans give a lot to charity he is instead talking about public policy that is indifferent to family breakdown on marriage and families french is even more wrong yes if you are poor and get married that is statistically an automatic ticket into the middle class but the story doesn t end there it is much more accurate to say that america s poor and working class don t get married because they are poor and working class individually people always have a choice but overall the marriage divide isn t a choice it is a systemic problem associated with poverty and largely caused by stupid decisions policymakers made long ago the vast majority of america s marriage decline is concentrated among poor and working class americans as marriage rates plummeted among america s poor the institution has remained resilient among america s upper middle and upper class who still marry at rates similar to those 50 years ago among the poorest americans marriage has all but disappeared poor americans want to be married but they don t see it as attainable poorer americans also want children a goal that is attainable without marriage thus the skyrocketing rate of non marital births among poor whites and minorities over the past century today 40 percent of american children are born out of wedlock and one third of american children are fatherless fatherlessness is the greatest predictor of a child being stuck in poverty spending time in jail as an adult or mental health difficulties among a whole host of other problems fatherless kids are even at a greater risk of abuse david autor and david figlio studied and rejected the idea that these effects are due to dangerous neighborhoods or poor schools they concluded that neighborhoods and schools are less important than the direct effect of family structure itself displacing people s familial habits of self support yes adults can always choose marriage but bad choices affect future generations and make it harder for children to make the right choice once they are adults not having married parents in effect tends to socially disable children that s a big reason social mobility in america is at an all time low if you were born into the wrong station it becomes harder to make those right choices and wrong choices become much more damaging and difficult to undo although it s still up to you to avoid those wrong choices heavy government incentives also make the right choice harder for too many americans cash welfare started during the new deal but took off in the early 1960s when great society welfare programs began to compete mightily with earnings from working class men paying out specifically when there was no man in the home here s harvard s paul peterson some programs actively discouraged marriage welfare assistance went to mothers so long as no male was boarding in the household access to food stamps and medicaid was automatic only if the welfare assistance met government approval once a family income crossed a specific threshold access to these resources disappeared marriage to an employed male even one earning the minimum wage placed at risk a mother s economic well being the benefits available if only dad left the home were extremely generous according to peterson analysts at the time estimated that in 1975 a household head would have to earn 20 000 a year to have more resources than what could be obtained from great society programs in today s dollars that s more than 90 000 per year in earnings although today s welfare no longer explicitly prohibits a father in the home marriage is still heavily dis incentivized that s because welfare is given out if a family is below an income threshold and combining two adults incomes makes rising above that threshold more likely great society welfare programs began to compete with earnings from working class men paying out specifically when there was no man in the home so not only are elites doing nothing to address this issue they caused the problem in the first place in minnesota the child care benefit program alone can have a marriage penalty totaling close to 20 000 per year for a family with two small children according to this author s calculations that program wasn t signed into law by a democrat it was signed into law by george h w bush now federal programs including obamacare s subsidies have marriage penalties that reach well up into the middle class and income brackets subject to these penalties are now starting to experience declining marriage rates and increased fatherlessness carlson says de industrialization and the resulting dent to working men s wages which started in the 1970s is a big contributor to fatherlessness it may be but the breakdown of the poor american family started during welfare expansion in the 1960s before heavy offshoring although it did worsen in the 1970s and 1980s either way the plight of the american blue collar worker provides another example of a group of americans being hammered by policy choices beyond their control federal spending and inflation is stealing savings median u s wages have barely budged for 30 years many americans have even seen declining purchasing power over this time and that s assuming we believe the federal government s inflation statistics if the federal government is underestimating inflation in the long run the slide in earnings power is even worse so today the average american has little savings and is loaded with debt only about 40 percent of americans have enough savings to cover a 1 000 emergency half of americans will likely struggle in retirement u s consumer debt is at an all time high too it used to be made up of mortgage debt but so many people lost their houses in the last recession that consumer debt has shifted to auto and student loans america s working class used to deposit their money at the bank and receive a positive return after inflation again these problems began to arise five decades ago the household leverage ratio in the u s went from a steady 80 percent pre 1970 to 130 percent by 1990 to an unstable 220 percent in pre crisis 2008 household debt increased right along with u s government debt total government business household and financial debt was about 1 8 times national income gdp in 1980 compared with 3 5 times today that deserves some emphasis for much of this county s history total debt hovered around a healthy 1 5 times national income in just 40 years that historical ratio increased by two turns to 3 5 times national income the american blue collar worker has borne the brunt of all these problems french might say it is these people s fault for not saving enough but america s working class used to deposit their money at the bank and receive a positive return after inflation why save when you get a negative return after inflation or americans could invest their money but today we have serial stock market bubbles that have repeatedly wiped out nest eggs it can take decades to make your money back after a market crash even assuming the reinvestment of dividends when factoring in inflation although it is a choice to take out debt to try to maintain one s standard of living can you really blame people when the alternative is slipping into poverty despite working plus ultra low interest rates make debt cheap at this point it is just a matter of supply and demand cheap debt equals more debt french is also wrong about de industrialization what about u s de industrialization in a series of totally anecdotal tweets french mentioned that if factory jobs were outsourced it is because the factory couldn t compete remember french doubted the whole de industrialization thing in the first place the american economy suffers from too little long term investment which should also be blamed on bad policy choices but this defies both evidence and reason yes u s factory output is up overall but oodles of production lines and jobs have been shipped overseas to areas with cheaper labor chiefly china french says automation is the cause for the sharp decline in factory jobs and it is true that there is a debate among economists over whether china or automation is the primary culprit for factory job losses but china caused a good chunk of it either way there is also ample evidence that more investment and automation would actually create more american jobs with higher real wages because this would boost productivity in actuality the american economy suffers from too little long term investment which should also be blamed on bad policy choices french is also wrong to say that offshoring to china is because of the free market low rates have meant huge mergers and acquisitions activity but one of the only sectors not subject to control by a few powerful firms and not making profits in excess of what would be the case in a normal competitive environment is manufacturing in other words there are barriers to entry among many industries many created by policymakers that are protected from offshoring but manufacturing is not protected this is also the result of policymakers choices this has allowed america to get away with overspending and building up huge debts both private and government it is no mistake that america s de industrialization started when president nixon took america off the bretton woods gold standard which occurred around the same time america s economy began opening up to foreign trade in a normal international trading relationship when a country receives american dollars in exchange for goods made overseas that country would want to use the dollars to buy american goods if america wasn t making enough goods or goods the rest of the world wanted our currency would drop and we would all suffer a loss of purchasing power but because the dollar is the world s primary reserve currency other countries are more than happy to sit on dollars often using these dollars to buy u s treasurys and not use those dollars to buy american goods countries can also suppress their own currencies giving their exports an advantage by building up their hoard of american dollars this has allowed america to get away with overspending and building up huge debts both private and government but in such a system when america can keep buying from the rest of the world without our currency dropping blue collar americans uniquely suffer from america s collective bad policy choices an ode to populism it matters whether french is right because the dispute comes down to whether the system should continue to be tinkered with or needs more radical overhaul if families are disintegrating solely because of culture or because individuals made bad choices then radical policy changes will be ineffective or even harmful america needs elites but our system won t work unless these elites are smart and chivalrous enough to think beyond themselves but if families are fracturing even partly due to policymakers bad choices then reforms are needed and it is criminal that something wasn t done long ago the problem with deciding the latter is that it implicates a lot of people including maybe french when carlson uses the word elite it isn t some conspiracy word it simply means the average or totality of decision makers at the federal or state level and those who influence them unequivocally this crowd has ignored important issues and instead focused on tinkering with the tax code welfare could be changed to boost poor married couples america could pursue monetary reform or go after other countries for currency manipulation college debt hurts family formation so higher education could be deflated health care was corporatist and broken before obamacare why can t americans see the prices of the health care they consume before they consume it and it is high time for a renewed antitrust push politicians by and large don t understand these things or are unwilling to take on entrenched lobbies that s not good america needs elites but our system won t work unless these elites are smart and chivalrous enough to think beyond themselves count me and i m sure carlson among the growing number of americans who will no longer accept tinkering around the edges or countenance politicians pretending that a tax cut provides the answers that we seek far too often many use populist to label anything they don t like but if being populist means we should care about america s ailing working and middle class here s to the day when we re all called populists

with bastien inzaurralde the ticker here s a stumper for oddsmakers what will president trump agree to first a deal with democrats to end the government shutdown or one with the chinese to cease trade hostilities unlikely as it may seem the advantage could be shifting in favor of a breakthrough with china such an outcome appeared significantly more remote just a month ago when trump set a 90 day egg timer for negotiations with beijing before resuming intensification of the trade standoff but as most of washington fixates on the shutdown stalemate a possible resolution of the standoff between

welfare programs began to compete mightily with earnings from working class men paying out specifically when there was no man in the home here s harvard s paul peterson some programs actively discouraged marriage welfare assistance went to mothers so long as no male was boarding in the household access to food stamps and medicaid was automatic only if the welfare assistance met government approval once a family income crossed a specific threshold access to these resources disappeared marriage to an employed male even one earning the minimum wage placed at risk a mother s economic well being the benefits available if only dad left the home were extremely generous according to peterson analysts at the time estimated that in 1975 a household head would have to earn 20 000 a year to have more resources than what could be obtained from great society programs in today s dollars that s more than 90 000 per year in earnings although today s welfare no longer explicitly prohibits a father in the home marriage is still heavily dis incentivized that s because welfare is given out if a family is below an income threshold and combining two adults incomes makes rising above that threshold more likely great society welfare programs began to compete with earnings from working class men paying out specifically when there was no man in the home so not only are elites doing nothing to address this issue they caused the problem in the first place in minnesota the child care benefit program alone can have a marriage penalty totaling close to 20 000 per year for a family with two small children according to this author s calculations that program wasn t signed into law by a democrat it was signed into law by george h w bush now federal programs including obamacare s subsidies have marriage penalties that reach well up into the middle class and income brackets subject to these penalties are now starting to experience declining marriage rates and increased fatherlessness carlson says de industrialization and the resulting dent to working men s wages which started in the 1970s is a big contributor to fatherlessness it may be but the breakdown of the poor american family started during welfare expansion in the 1960s before heavy offshoring although it did worsen in the 1970s and 1980s either way the plight of the american blue collar worker provides another example of a group of americans being hammered by policy choices beyond their control federal spending and inflation is stealing savings median u s wages have barely budged for 30 years many americans have even seen declining purchasing power over this time and that s assuming we believe the federal government s inflation statistics if the federal government is underestimating inflation in the long run the slide in earnings power is even worse so today the average american has little savings and is loaded with debt only about 40 percent of americans have enough savings to cover a 1 000 emergency half of americans will likely struggle in retirement u s consumer debt is at an all time high too it used to be made up of mortgage debt but so many people lost their houses in the last recession that consumer debt has shifted to auto and student loans america s working class used to deposit their money at the bank and receive a positive return after inflation again these problems began to arise five decades ago the household leverage ratio in the u s went from a steady 80 percent pre 1970 to 130 percent by 1990 to an unstable 220 percent in pre crisis 2008 household debt increased right along with u s government debt total government business household and financial debt was about 1 8 times national income gdp in 1980 compared with 3 5 times today that deserves some emphasis for much of this county s history total debt hovered around a healthy 1 5 times national income in just 40 years that historical ratio increased by two turns to 3 5 times national income the american blue collar worker has borne the brunt of all these problems french might say it is these people s fault for not saving enough but america s working class used to deposit their money at the bank and receive a positive return after inflation why save when you get a negative return after inflation or americans could invest their money but today we have serial stock market bubbles that have repeatedly wiped out nest eggs it can take decades to make your money back after a market crash even assuming the reinvestment of dividends when factoring in inflation although it is a choice to take out debt to try to maintain one s standard of living can you really blame people when the alternative is slipping into poverty despite working plus ultra low interest rates make debt cheap at this point it is just a matter of supply and demand cheap debt equals more debt french is also wrong about de industrialization what about u s de industrialization in a series of totally anecdotal tweets french mentioned that if factory jobs were outsourced it is because the factory couldn t compete remember french doubted the whole de industrialization thing in the first place the american economy suffers from too little long term investment which should also be blamed on bad policy choices but this defies both evidence and reason yes u s factory output is up overall but oodles of production lines and jobs have been shipped overseas to areas with cheaper labor chiefly china french says automation is the cause for the sharp decline in factory jobs and it is true that there is a debate among economists over whether china or automation is the primary culprit for factory job losses but china caused a good chunk of it either way there is also ample evidence that more investment and automation would actually create more american jobs with higher real wages because this would boost productivity in actuality the american economy suffers from too little long term investment which should also be blamed on bad policy choices french is also wrong to say that offshoring to china is because of the free market low rates have meant huge mergers and acquisitions activity but one of the only sectors not subject to control by a few powerful firms and not making profits in excess of what would be the case in a normal competitive environment is manufacturing in other words there are barriers to entry among many industries many created by policymakers that are protected from offshoring but manufacturing is not protected this is also the result of policymakers choices this has allowed america to get away with overspending and building up huge debts both private and government it is no mistake that america s de industrialization started when president nixon took america off the bretton woods gold standard which occurred around the same time america s economy began opening up to foreign trade in a normal international trading relationship when a country receives american dollars in exchange for goods made overseas that country would want to use the dollars to buy american goods if america wasn t making enough goods or goods the rest of the world wanted our currency would drop and we would all suffer a loss of purchasing power but because the dollar is the world s primary reserve currency other countries are more than happy to sit on dollars often using these dollars to buy u s treasurys and not use those dollars to buy american goods countries can also suppress their own currencies giving their exports an advantage by building up their hoard of american dollars this has allowed america to get away with overspending and building up huge debts both private and government but in such a system when america can keep buying from the rest of the world without our currency dropping blue collar americans uniquely suffer from america s collective bad policy choices an ode to populism it matters whether french is right because the dispute comes down to whether the system should continue to be tinkered with or needs more radical overhaul if families are disintegrating solely because of culture or because individuals made bad choices then radical policy changes will be ineffective or even harmful america needs elites but our system won t work unless these elites are smart and chivalrous enough to think beyond themselves but if families are fracturing even partly due to policymakers bad choices then reforms are needed and it is criminal that something wasn t done long ago the problem with deciding the latter is that it implicates a lot of people including maybe french when carlson uses the word elite it isn t some conspiracy word it simply means the average or totality of decision makers at the federal or state level and those who influence them unequivocally this crowd has ignored important issues and instead focused on tinkering with the tax code welfare could be changed to boost poor married couples america could pursue monetary reform or go after other countries for currency manipulation college debt hurts family formation so higher education could be deflated health care was corporatist and broken before obamacare why can t americans see the prices of the health care they consume before they consume it and it is high time for a renewed antitrust push politicians by and large don t understand these things or are unwilling to take on entrenched lobbies that s not good america needs elites but our system won t work unless these elites are smart and chivalrous enough to think beyond themselves count me and i m sure carlson among the growing number of americans who will no longer accept tinkering around the edges or countenance politicians pretending that a tax cut provides the answers that we seek far too often many use populist to label anything they don t like but if being populist means we should care about america s ailing working and middle class here s to the day when we re all called populists

a truth about movements is they move they morph evolve and move around a country or even around the globe this occurs over months and often over years the u s occupy encampment era occurred ten months after the arab spring and six months after the spanish indignado movement early versions of occupy it started in new york and then spread across the united states and to other countries it was a global revolt against the 1 that changed politics in the united states and continues to have impacts today the yellow vest gilets jaunes movement in france is having a major impact and gaining international attention already spreading to other nations with some nations like egypt banning the sale of yellow vests to prevent the protest from spreading there the movement is showing that disrupting business as usual gets results will it come to the united states what form would it take here what could spark the equivalent of the yellow vests in the u s social movements create global waves of protest it is common for a protest to develop in one part of the world and move to another country this is even more common in modern times as the economy has become globalized and communication across different countries has become easier the u s revolution against great britain was part of the age of enlightenment which questioned traditional authority and emphasized natural rights of life liberty and equality as well as sought self government and religious freedom the french revolution followed 13 years after the us in 1789 it led to political changes in the u k germany and across europe this coincided with the great liberator simon bolivar freeing colonies from the spanish empire including venezuela colombia panama ecuador and peru they became independent and briefly united as a single nation the democratic revolutions of 1848 known as the springtime of peoples were part of a widespread revolutionary period that impacted 50 nations in europe beginning in france and spreading without any evident coordination the issues were about democratic and worker rights as well as human rights and freedom of the press it led to the abolition of serfdom in some nations and ended monarchy in denmark the french monarchy was replaced by a republic constitutions were created and empires were threatened by countries seeking sovereignty in the era of decolonization of africa and asia 1945 and 1960 three dozen new states achieved autonomy or outright independence from their european colonial rulers in africa a pan african congress in 1945 demanded an end to colonization there were widespread unrest and organized revolts in both northern and sub saharan colonies protests revolutions and sometimes peaceful transition ended the era of colonization the 1960s were an era of protest that peaked in 1968 around the world multiple issues came to the forefront including for labor rights and socialism the feminist movement protests against war and militarism and against racism and environmental degradation protests occurred in the united states europe the soviet bloc asia and latin america more recently economic globalization and the internet have accelerated global protests an example of this is the anti globalization movement itself as corporations took control of trade agreements and began to write trade for transnational corporate profits people around the world saw how this impacted their communities and fought back the zapatista uprising in chiapas mexico on january 1 1994 was an uprising that coincided with the beginning of the north american free trade agreement nafta the zapatista army of national liberation was an uprising by the indigenous local population against being exploited by global trade their action was an inspiration to others and an anti nafta movement developed in the united states growing into an anti globalization movement the 1997 financial crisis in southeast asia followed by the international monetary fund restructuring the debt in ways that brought austerity led to protests across the region in korea indonesia and thailand against economic globalization and the undue influence of transnational capital these combined into the battle for seattle in 1999 at the world trade organization meetings where 50 000 people from the u s and around the world protested on the streets of seattle for four days shutting down the meetings this was a movement of movements moment that united many single issue groups into a force too powerful for the elites to overcome wto meetings since then have been met with mass protests as have imf and other economic meetings this evolved into making it very difficult to pass corporate trade agreements in the united states e g the people stopped the trans pacific partnership and trump will have difficulty getting nafta 2 approved join the campaign to stop trump trade s nafta 2 the yellow vest movement the french yellow vest movement is made up of working people who are protesting the unfair economy every saturday the 8th act held this saturday was larger than expected as the government and media were claiming the movement was dying down over the holidays despite the movement saying they were not over and were just getting started the movement began as a protest against a gasoline tax but it quickly became evident that this was just the final straw against a series of policies that have made people economically insecure president macron has aggressively pursued a neoliberal agenda on behalf of the wealthy lowering their taxes while cutting social services macron has responded with the elimination of the fuel tax raising the minimum wage and cutting taxes on pensioners but they continue to call for the president of the rich to step down macron s popularity is down into the twenties in polls while a majority of french people want the yellow vest protests to continue the movement is exposing contradictions in france that cannot be solved by the current economic and political systems macron while making concessions has also called the protesters thugs and agitators police tactics have been aggressive and violent in the face of mostly nonviolent protests they arrested a yellow vest participant eric drouet who the media has labeled a leader on flimsy charges of protesting without a permit stoking more outrage the media calls him a leader while saying the leaderless movement will fail because it lacks a leader this reminds us of similar treatment during occupy the movement has blown up political divides because there are people from the extreme left extreme right and everywhere in between participating it includes young and old male and female it shows people uniting in a revolt over the unfair economic system and its impact on workers they are also calling for participatory democracy by demanding citizen initiatives where people can vote on legislation firing political appointees or even changing the constitution if they gather enough signatures the yellow vests are showing system wide problems that require both the economic and political systems to change many of the problems the french people suffer are also felt in the united states the u s economy has been designed for the wealthy for decades and billionaire president trump era policies have made that reality worse people never fully recovered from the 2008 economic collapse when millions lost houses and jobs got lower income and higher debt the globalized economy that has been designed for transnational corporations has not served the people in the united states well the fly over states of the midwest have been left hollowed out rural hospitals are closing as the economy disappears in urban areas across the country decades of neglect and lack of investment have created impoverished conditions racist and violent policing have been used to prevent rebellion and contain the unrest people are struggling addiction and suicide rates are up there is vast hopelessness and despair an economic collapse is on the horizon as alan woods writes in new year new crisis the question is not if it will happen only when the u s economy is dominated by wall street which ended the year in crisis citigroup s share price declined 30 percent from where it started the year goldman sachs declined 35 percent morgan stanley 24 percent bank of america 18 percent and jpmorgan had a 10 percent loss woods points to china s economy slowing as is germany s and problems in other european nations all point to a global slow down which those in power do not have tools to respond to as interest rates are already low and government debt is already high when the recession hits the economic insecurity of the people will worsen like the people in france the rich are getting obscenely richer and avoiding taxes by hiding billions offshore and the government is doing the opposite of what is needed e g reducing taxes on the wealthy when there should be a millionaire s tax of 70 percent and blocking the green new deal and when the economic crisis hits people will blame trump many voters supported him because he promised to break from a system that is designed to favor the wealthy they will know from their own experience that he did the opposite stop trumpism will become an even louder rallying cry and a president whose popularity always hovered around 40 percent will find himself in polls at 30 percent or lower as a presidential campaign kicks into high gear the economy is often the trigger event as it was for occupy and we already know there are going to be mass teacher strikes in 2019 indeed plans to strike in l a are expected to escalate more broadly the 40 000 people who lose their jobs as a result of four u s general motors factories closing could face losing their homes and have other economic stresses causing them to revolt congress refusing to take national improved medicare for all seriously when tens of thousands of people are dying every year simply because they are uninsured could light the spark people in the u s might not be wearing yellow vests but we know from other recent protest movements people are willing to shut down streets and highways and stop business as usual more may participate if a radicalizing moment ensues now that they have seen the model work in france there are many triggers that are likely to spark aggressive mass protests in 2019 get ready

professor akpan ekpo an economist and former director general of the west african institute for financial and economic management waifem believes that the federal government does not need any tutorials from the world bank or international monetary fund imf on how to handle the external reserves according to him when your revenue is increasing from that kind of source you have to manage it very well because oil revenue is a windfall in this interview he explained that the nation should use most of the reserves to build infrastructure and reduce borrowing economy it depends on how you want to look at it the recent numbers are not that good the recent numbers just came out of the nbs in terms of the growth trajectory but again it is not that bad if you are just coming out of a recession why i say the economy is not performing satisfactorily is that unemployment is still very high inflation double digits lending rates 25 per cent poverty is increasing heavily the human capital index is very bad the misery index is still rising so we cannot say we are doing well at the macro side even though we just came out of a recession at sectoral level there are some challenges manufacturing is not doing well the service sector which they claim it is doing well is misleading because you look at how an economy performs you move from primary to secondary industry to services the index that services contribute 5 per cent to gdp is not correct because our service sector is very rudimentary normally if the service is doing well like in the us germany japan you will say you have arrived the numbers might probably be so because the new way of calculating the gdp has so many services in each category another recession every time i see oil price going up i get worried because once it goes up we just relax i once said that i wish the oil price was zero maybe we will be forced to do what we have to do now our reserves are rising compared to what it used to be but i hope they stay on course in the reforms you know in nigeria our problem is that it is an election year and once politics dominates they will no longer be concerned with how to build the economy currency or economy if you are building your economy and you change the structure of your economy you don t worry about the exchange rate productivity will determine the value one time the nigerian naira was very strong how come we are not developed so the main thing is to develop your economy industrialise and then the currency will find its value foreign reserves we don t need the imf to tell us that we should manage our reserves very well because first of all what is the source of the reserves it is an outside source of revenue we have no control so when your revenue is increasing from that kind of source you have to manage it very well because oil revenue is a windfall we have seen that for years norway used its oil revenue to build infrastructure our own foreign reserves are used to intervene every week in the forex market yet the rate is not changing much so we need to use most of the reserves to build infrastructure and reduce our borrowing foreign reserves are money in dollars or pounds sterling or yuan so instead of you going to negotiate debt you take a part of it and sterilise it in order for you to manage it you need to know to what proportion they say you need reserves to finance three months of imports now we have reserves that can finance up to 20 something months of imports is that necessary is that something to be proud of you can have reserves to finance six months of imports then the other months use it there are countries which don t have reserves to finance one month i am not saying it is right even if you think you have enough you don t have enough because the currency is not yours slow down reserves decline you can t help it i don t know what they are using the reserves for domestically but in terms of the fluctuation you don t have a choice it is based on the global oil prices that is why we say don t forget to build other sectors of the economy build agriculture industrialise when we say diversify our economy we mean earn foreign exchange from other sources do you not think that our problem is prioritisation of infrastructure let me define infrastructure you have two types hard and soft when we talk of hard infrastructure we are talking of power power is infrastructure if you look at this country we have so much gas yet we have power problems by now nigeria should have a mass transit system in the big cities to link up the major towns the private sector is the engine of growth but not the engine of development because they invest for a purpose we need a government that is strategic in thinking go to singapore they have no oil but have refineries the drift is come and refine the oil and pay us these things were built on developmental state philosophy what is our own philosophy we get confused all the time what we have is state capture the elites have captured the state for their own interest so even if you have individuals who intend development they are so inconsequential that they can t make a difference i have been advocating developmental state philosophy in the context of market socialism like china in any country in the world those that are rich are very few but a large middle class like the united states in the us the middle class determine who governs if you bribe them you are wasting your time they can take your bribe and won t vote for you because they have all the basics of life but when you have the rich there and the rest are poor there is a problem afcta i think eventually we should sign it for several reasons we should sign it not because it may work but as nigeria you want to be like the leader you show by example and say ok let s try this one in africa the trade thing is to create at least maybe a larger market as africans but each country must look at its own interest in our case i think the fear is that smes are making progress and this might overcloud it it might only become more competitive and produce quality products there are some countries you will go and see shirts made in south africa kenya and ghana because of the competition they take their time and do something well we should have just signed like south africa did brexit what britain is doing is normal they exit europe and strengthen markets across what do we export it is oil if you look at the data 80 per cent of what we import is from the oecd countries all the goods on the street of lagos they are from china the only export is crude oil as at last year i don t think any goes to britain so even our trade with britain is one sided we import their finished goods and services and now they are leaving europe they are looking for a large market brexit trumpism we should be thinking of what will be the adverse effect on us like china and us now they are fighting are we thinking ahead of what will happen china is a very smart country what they will lose from the us they will make sure they gain from other countries are they going to increase the price of goods that people are buying in nigeria that are made in china of course they are going to so what steps are we taking as a country if free trade is what the textbook says there will be no negotiation so nigeria should start thinking ahead of what will happen with this china us fight brexit are we doing this i don t know in nigeria when they are doing this they rely on foreign affairs our foreign affairs in nigeria unlike other countries they don t have the expertise to look at some of these things and at times they do it in isolation of the relevant ministries default in loan repayment to china yes anytime you are dealing with the chinese you have to worry because their aid package is always so complicated they will tell you that there is always a 20 per cent grant element if you don t have good negotiators they can sell your country so they are smart china has as we speak over 434 state companies the people building your road in nigeria are state companies so they send them to work in africa so with the chinese we need very good negotiators i don t think nigeria can go through what zambia experienced debt debt to gdp ratio is very good because you elevated your gdp the denominator is now large when you now divide it of course you will not get to the benchmark but that does not give you the licence to keep borrowing i prefer the debt to revenue ratio because gdp does not pay debts revenue does if you watch they are very silent on that if they show the debt to revenue ratio the economy is in trouble let s take the debt to gdp ratio even if you have not gotten to the benchmark it is not a licence to keep borrowing more borrowing more debt servicing what are we borrowing for if we are borrowing to pay nigeria airways their salaries then it is very dangerous no country does that you may borrow to finance capital expenditure which has a positive multiplier effect my argument has been that why eurobonds all the time when you have concessionary rates with the adb and the world bank with a long period of payment there are a lot of reasons why you go there because you can put shadow items when it comes to eurobond eurobond will be faster but with a high interest rate nigeria has a trust fund which we can leverage on at the afdb if you go to them and say look we want money negotiate and say we have a trust fund otherwise we withdraw the trust fund they will release it why not go there why not go to the world bank where they will give you a lot of time if you default in those ones you can renegotiate new minimum wage they have no choice the minimum wage increase is long overdue minimum wage is even a constitutional requirement how those who are working survive on n18 000 a month only god knows the problem with nigeria is that once they adjust minimum wage those at the top think they should also adjust theirs at the same rate having said that the entire nigerian service incentive structure is warped the structure is very bad in terms of salary those at the bottom is terrible those at the top for example a perm sec earns n1 5 million a month a director earns less than n300 000 he will collect bribe to sustain his livelihood the graduates everything put together may be n80 000 the whole thing is crazy i pity this government how do you fix it something has to be done at some point the mdas are earning different salaries despite being in the same public sector so how do you encourage civil servants to take the work seriously if you go back to history you will understand this so called negotiation is what i called a bureaucratic wage making process it is not based on productivity even the nigeria minimum wage when it s agreed upon only government and few companies pay it i won t blame buhari government but they should have taken it as a matter of urgency when they came in cbn s leadership the way cbn is structured even if a new person comes there will be continuity in most countries the central bank governors are to be seen not to be heard it s a conservative institution a lot of things will continue based on the data that they have in terms of arms of the nigerian government they are the one with the most expertise the problem is that they have that monetary side expertise but the government side does not have the same expertise in most cases the two must coordinate a lot of times cbn is doing the government s work they also do fiscal policy which they should not be doing source the cable
as 2019 gets under way and it becomes more clear that activity in the world s three biggest economies the united states the euro zone and china is weakening businesspeople and investors are increasingly looking to policymakers in beijing to unveil a stimulus package they hope will support growth and financial markets not just in china but around the world but although china rode to the rescue in 2009 and again in 2015 16 rolling out stimulus measures that boosted demand both at home and abroad things are different this time around while beijing will loosen its policies to stabilise china s domestic economy anyone hoping for the kind of all out stimulus effort big enough to provide a shot in the arm for growth and markets around the world is going to be disappointed to many observers such a major programme looks ever more necessary almost 10 years after the last recession ended the us economic cycle is looking increasingly long in the tooth with the us labour market at its tightest in 50 years and the federal reserve having raised interest rates from 0 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent to head off inflation the economic headwinds are fiercer than in years ominously in december the ism index of us manufacturing activity registered its steepest monthly fall since october 2008 the month after the collapse of lehman brothers last year growth was supported by donald trump s tax cuts which went into force at the beginning of 2018 but with the house of representatives back under democratic control since last thursday no further such fiscal stimulus is on the cards for 2019 as a result us growth is set to slow this year activity is also softening in europe but with interest rates in the euro zone already negative and the european central bank no longer printing money there is little prospect of any boost from monetary policy meanwhile the european union s budget rules prevent any significant fiscal stimulus so it is little surprise that people are looking to china for a policy stimulus lifeline especially after local industrial profits fell in november and two closely followed indices of manufacturing activity turned negative in december indicating a contraction for the first time in two years in recent weeks observers have been getting excited at the prospect of major stimulative tax cuts from beijing in october the authorities lopped some 500 billion yuan us 72 8 billion off individual income taxes now following a high level economic policy meeting in late december china watchers expect cuts in both value added tax and corporate income tax rates over the next couple of months that together could be worth an additional 1 5 trillion yuan us 218 5 billion combined these tax cuts would push the government s budget deficit from roughly 3 per cent of china s gross domestic product to more than 5 per cent such extensive cuts say enthusiasts would be even bigger in absolute terms than last year s us tax cuts supporting growth both in china and in the rest of the world through increased chinese demand for imports especially of commodities it s a pretty story but unfortunately it misreads how government finances in china actually work it is true that these tax cuts would substantially widen beijing s headline deficit but the government s official fiscal balance is largely meaningless it only captures the central government s budget and a small proportion of local government deficits most government borrowing and spending especially capital investment on infrastructure happens off balance sheet at the local government level factor this in and china s true budget balance has been running at a deficit of around 10 per cent of gdp for years recently this spending has come under pressure as beijing has moved to reduce risk in china s shadow banking market the source of much of the funding for local government infrastructure investment as a result overall credit growth in the economy has slowed from an annual rate of 15 per cent in early 2017 to less than 10 per cent in november this decline in credit growth has been unaffected by beijing s efforts last year to inject liquidity into the banking system by cutting the proportion of deposits that banks are required to set aside as reserves together the decline in credit growth and fears of a deepening tariff war with the us have squeezed economic activity pushing economic growth down to its lowest since early 2009 in the depths of the global crisis whether the trade war escalates from here depends largely on the political whims of the us president however beijing is already moving to stabilise domestic credit growth for example by bringing forward and increasing quotas for local government bond issues to fund infrastructure investment but there is little chance of a credit binge of the sort seen in 2009 when credit growth leapt from 16 per cent to 33 per cent or even of the scale of 2015 16 when it climbed from 12 per cent to 16 per cent there are several reasons for this firstly beijing continues to pursue the reduction of financial sector risk as the government made clear following last month s economic policy meeting a general credit binge would undo much of that good work secondly rapid and widespread credit growth would risk re inflating bubbles in china s property markets which remain overheated in many cities instead beijing will allow city governments to relax their targeted administrative measures to manage local prices thirdly the government is trying to engineer a structural transformation away from growth powered by investment towards an economy driven primarily by consumption an investment boom now would be setting back that goal as a result policy easing this year will be aimed at stabilising credit growth and maintaining economic growth at above the 6 per cent level not at procuring the sort of pick up in activity seen in 2009 and should the trade war with the us worsen beijing is likely to absorb much of the shock by allowing the yuan to weaken in the foreign exchange market together these measures should support activity in china s domestic economy but they will not lead to the sort of upsurge in chinese demand for capital goods and commodity imports that foreign businesspeople and investors are hoping will boost economic growth in the rest of the world in 2019 unlike 2009 beijing is not about to throw the global economy a lifeline source south china morning post
nicaragua the other revolution betrayed latin america january 8 2019 nathan legrand and éric toussaint the violent repression against demonstrators protesting brutal neoliberal policies which resulted in more than 300 people being killed by regime forces since april 2018 is just one of the reasons why different leftist social movements have condemned the nicaraguan regime led by president daniel ortega and vice president rosario murillo the left has many more reasons to denounce the policies of the regime to understand this we must go back to 1979 the sandinista revolution 1979 saw the victory of an authentic revolution in nicaragua that combined a popular uprising self organization of cities and neighborhoods in rebellion and the action of the sandinista national liberation front in spanish frente sandinista de liberación nacional fsln a political military organization inspired by a marxist guevarist castrist model the revolution put an end to the 42 year long authoritarian rule of the somoza dynasty which had appropriated the state its armed forces administration and significant parts of its economic assets and established a strong alliance with the united states the somoza dictatorship proving to be an effective bulwark against progressive political forces whose multinationals could maintain and increase their plundering of nicaragua s national resources in exchange for commissions which added to the increasingly important wealth of the somozas the fsln was founded in the 1960s as a leftist group opposing the government mainly through guerilla warfare it was not until some of its guerillas spectacularly took high ranking members of the nicaraguan ruling classes as hostages in december 1974 that it was considered a potentially serious threat to the somocista dictatorship earlier that year liberal fractions of the bourgeoisie opposing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the somoza ruling clique had already formed the democratic union of liberation in spanish unión democrática de liberación udel under the leadership of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal editor of the liberal newspaper la prensa to try and gather political momentum in favor of the liberalization of the regime after the stunt of the sandinista guerillas the regime declared a state of emergency increased its repressive grip over the nicaraguan society and hunted down the fsln faced with increasing difficulties the fsln eventually split into three factions the prolonged people s war faction stayed loyal to the strategy of accumulating forces in the remote areas until they would have enough strength to liberate entire regions of the country and launch a final assault against somoza s army the proletarian tendency emerged in order to challenge the prolonged people s war strategy considered not to be adequate given the absence of a permanent occupying army hence the rural populations would not directly witness the imperialist endeavor and would not massively join the guerilla and the development of a capitalist mode of production in the country the economic development of the 1950s and 1960s had given rise to an agricultural and an industrial proletariat which constituted respectively 40 and 10 of the active population by 1978 the proletarian tendency therefore focused on organizing mass working class organizations in urban areas and gaining the support of industrial workers with the perspective of launching a swift insurrection when the conditions to do so would be met finally the terceristas whose main figures included daniel ortega and his brother humberto also advocated for an insurrectional strategy but were open to tactical alliances with the liberal fractions of the bourgeoisie opposing somoza while the proletarian tendency stressed the need for a mass uprising and for self organization the terceristas displayed substitutist tendencies which implied that an armed insurrection led by organized guerillas without a simultaneous mass uprising would be sufficient to overthrow the regime and take power eventually the regime lifted the state of emergency in 1977 thinking the guerilla war was defeated and the conditions for entering negotiations with the liberal opposition were met but fsln groups were prompt to resume their armed actions in urban areas in january 1978 the murder of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal by the regime s soldiers was caught on video and sparked anger among the liberal opposition as well as among the toiling masses a general strike supported by the liberal bourgeoisie was launched while fsln groups staged armed actions against somoza s national guard in august another general strike was called while sandinista guerillas staged an assault against the national palace where a joint session of both chambers of the parliament was taking place taking hundreds hostage which successfully resulted in the liberation of several political prisoners from somoza s jails more importantly spontaneous uprisings took place against the regime enabling the left to gain momentum over the liberal opposition this culminated in several urban uprisings in september 1978 after the fsln called for insurrection while these uprisings were severely defeated by the national guard they scared away the liberal opposition whose representatives sought to enter negotiations with the regime mediated by the u s dominated organization of american states oas the terceristas denounced it and withdrew from the broad liberation front in spanish frente amplio opositor fao which they had constituted together with the liberal opposition paving the way for the reunification of the three sandinista currents in january 1979 somoza turned down the proposals of the liberal opposition the momentum was then with the sandinistas who dominated the new patriotic national front in spanish frente patriótico nacional fpn created in february 1979 and in which the liberal opposition was marginalized after reuniting the fsln called for a general strike to be held in june and prepared a broad military offensive to be launched at the same time the population effectively accompanied these actions through mass urban uprisings as the armed insurrection quickly liberated areas of the country one after the other somoza s army largely decomposed and when its last stronghold in the capital was finally liberated on july 19 1979 its last remnants had no choice but to flee abroad in particular to the neighboring country of honduras now in the government the revolutionary political forces among which the fsln was dominant pledged to install a democratic regime to guarantee a non alignment of nicaragua s foreign policy thus putting an end to the alliance with the united states and to develop a mixed economy in which the development of cooperatives and state owned enterprises would be encouraged while the existence of private capital would not be fundamentally threatened as long as it was perceived as patriotic that is loyal to the sandinista revolution rather than to the overthrown somocista regime or to u s imperialism during the first two years following the revolutionary victory several developments made the case of nicaragua different from other cases in which the left has come to power through elections in latin america including chile in 1970 venezuela in 1998 99 brazil in 2002 03 bolivia in 2005 06 and ecuador in 2006 07 due to the destruction of anastasio somoza s army and the flight of the dictator the fsln not only assumed governmental power which the other cases cited did via the electoral process it also replaced the somocista army with a new army that was put at the service of the people took over total control of the banks and decreed a public monopoly on foreign trade weapons were distributed to the population for their self defense due to risks of outside aggression and an attempted coup coming from the right these are fundamental changes that did not take place in the aforementioned countries they did take place in cuba between 1959 and 1961 and were extended during the 1960s in the 1980s major social progress was made in nicaragua in the areas of healthcare education improving housing conditions even if they remained rudimentary fuller rights to organization and protest access to credit for small producers thanks to nationalization of the banking system and more these represented undeniable progress however throughout the 1980s the fsln government had to fight a decade long war against the counter revolutionary forces known as the contras heavily supported by the united states which could never satisfy its ambition of direct military intervention to topple the sandinistas but settled for a low intensity conflict which would strangle nicaragua economically and isolate the fsln politically u s imperialism and its vassals such as the regime of carlos andrès perez in venezuela or dictatorships as in honduras found it necessary to contain the spreading of this extraordinary experiment in social liberation and renewal of national dignity in fact social revolt was rampant in the region in particular in salvador and guatemala where revolutionary forces close to the sandinistas had been active for decades in 1990 the fsln lost the general election to the right with violeta chamorro the widow of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal being elected president under chamorro nicaragua was to fully embrace the neoliberal austerity promoted by the washington consensus which was to result by the end of the decade in nicaragua becoming the second poorest country in the americas after haiti change society without taking power in the 1990s as a result of disappointed hopes there were those who were saying that what is needed is to try to change society without taking power one aspect of their approach was quite pertinent it is absolutely vital to promote processes of change that take place at the base of society and which presuppose self organization by citizens freedom of expression and freedom to demonstrate and organize but the idea that power must not be taken is not valid because it is not possible to really change society unless the people take power at the level of the state the question is rather how to build an authentic democracy in the original sense of the word that is power exercised directly by the people for the purpose of emancipation in other words power of the people by the people and for the people we feel that it was necessary to overthrow the somoza dictatorship through the combined action of a popular uprising and the intervention of a political military organization and as such the victory of july 1979 remains a popular triumph worthy of celebration it must be stressed that without the ingenuity and tenacity of the people during the struggle the fsln would not have succeeded in striking the decisive blow against the somoza dictatorship the fsln leadership did not go far enough in radicalization for the benefit of the people several questions arise did the fsln go too far in the changes it made in the society did it take the wrong direction or are the disappointing subsequent developments the result of aggression by north american imperialism and its allies in nicaragua and elsewhere in the region here we will highlight errors made in two main areas first the fsln leadership did not go far enough in taking radical measures in favor of the segments of the population who were most exploited and oppressed beginning with the poor rural population but also factory workers and healthcare and education workers who were generally underpaid it made too many concessions to agrarian and urban capitalists second the leadership of the fsln with its slogan national directorate give us your orders did not provide sufficient support for self organization and worker control it placed limits that were highly detrimental to the revolutionary process of course responsibility for the outbreak of the war lies exclusively with the enemies of the sandinista government the latter of which had no choice but to confront the aggression nevertheless errors were made in the means of waging the war humberto ortega the head of the army formed a regular army equipped with expensive heavy tanks unsuitable against the guerrilla methods of the contras and the conscription of the country s youth in order to reinforce the army was also badly perceived by the population this combined with the errors made in the area of agrarian reform had damaging consequences in a recent interview henry ruiz one of the nine members of the national leadership in the 1980s underlines the fact in these terms the campesinos were not favored on the contrary they were affected by the war the war waged by the contra and the war waged by us errors made by the sandinista leadership what errors were made here is a summary presentation of a question that deserves long discussion the agrarian question was not dealt with properly agrarian reform was seriously insufficient and the contras took full advantage of that fact much more land should have been distributed to rural families giving them title to the property because expectations were enormous among a large part of the population who needed land and were struggling to have the arable land in the large private estates including but not only those belonging to the somoza clan distributed to those who wanted to work it the orientation that won out among the sandinista leadership was to target the major somoza estates but to spare the interests of major capitalist groups and powerful families whom certain sandinista leaders wanted to turn into allies or fellow travelers another error was made the fsln wanted to quickly create a state agrarian sector and cooperatives to replace the large somocista estates which was not in line with the attitudes of the rural population priority should have been given to small and medium private farms distributing titles to the property and providing material and technical aid to the new campesino owners priority also should have been given to support for production for the domestic market which was already substantial but could have been improved and increased and the regional market making maximum use of organic agriculture methods to sum up the leadership of the fsln combined two serious errors on the one hand it made too many concessions to the bourgeois who were considered allies in the change then in progress and on the other hand it engaged in excessive statism or artificial cooperativism the result was not long in coming a part of the population disappointed by the decisions of the sandinista government was attracted by the contra the latter had the intelligence to adopt a discourse that was aimed at the disillusioned campesinos telling them that they would help them overthrow the fsln resulting in a truly fair distribution of land and true agrarian reform this was deceitful propaganda but it was widely disseminated that is corroborated by a series of studies in the field which éric toussaint one of the authors of this article had access to from 1986 1987 after several trips made to nicaragua to provide internationalist solidarity in particular studies led in rural regions where the contra had gained popular support certain entities within the sandinista movement itself conducted very serious surveys on the ground and alerted the sandinista leadership about what was happening these included the work coordinated by orlando nuñez whose later political evolution led him to remain loyal to ortega despite his initial left wing sandinista stance work done by other entities independent of the government and related to liberation theology came to the same conclusions a number of rural organizations linked to sandinism unag atc etc were also aware of the problems but engaged in self censorship and internationalist experts specialized in the rural world also sounded the alarm concerning self organization and worker control the fsln inherited the cuban tradition which promotes popular organization but within a very controlled and limited framework cuba which at the start of the 1960s had experienced a broad movement toward self organization gradually moved toward a model in which there is much greater control from above starting with the increase in soviet influence in the late 1960s 1970s and part of the fsln leadership was trained in cuba at that time the decade after 1970 has been defined as the grey period by an entire generation of cuban marxists in short the sandinista leadership inherited a tradition that was strongly influenced by the bureaucratic degeneration of the soviet union and its destructive impact on a large part of the left internationally including in cuba similarly the application starting in 1988 of a structural adjustment program that strongly resembled the programs dictated to other countries by the imf and the world bank is another error made by the sandinista government regarding this question sandinista members have made their criticism of the orientation that was taken by their leadership very clear they expressed their point of view both internally and publicly but unfortunately no correction of the errors ensued the government extended a policy that was leading the process straight into a wall and would result in popular rejection at the polls and a victory of the right in the election of february 1990 it was not overly radical policies that weakened the sandinista revolution what prevented it from advancing sufficiently with the support of a majority of the population was its failure to put the people at the core of the transition that followed the overthrow of the somoza dictatorship in short the government maintained an economic orientation that was compatible with the interests of nicaragua s wealthy bourgeoisie and major private foreign corporations that is an economy oriented toward export and based on low wages in order to remain competitive on the worldwide market this was not doomed to happen alternative policies could have been implemented the government should have paid more attention to the needs and aspirations of the people in rural as well as urban areas it should have redistributed land for the benefit of the campesinos developing and or strengthening small landholding and to the extent possible forms of voluntary cooperatives the government should have promoted wage increases for workers both in the private and public sectors if the sandinistas had really wanted to break away from the export oriented extractivist model that depends on competitiveness on the international market they should have gone against the interests of the capitalists that still dominated the export oriented extractivist industry they should have done more to gradually implement policies in favor of the small and medium sized producers who supplied the domestic market such as protectionist measures in order to limit importations this would have allowed the peasants and small and medium enterprises not to have to make sacrifices for the sake of competitiveness on the international market instead of encouraging the masses to follow orders given from the top of the fsln self organization by citizens should have been promoted at all levels and citizens should have been given control over the public administration as well as over the accounts of private companies the political institutions that were installed by the fsln did not fundamentally differ from the ones of a parliamentary democracy with a strong presidential role something which would impede the capacity of the masses to constitute a counter power when the right would be elected in 1990 concessions were made to local big capital which was wrongly perceived as being patriotic and an ally of the people the increases in wages were limited fiscal incentives in the form of lower taxation were given to the bosses any such alliance should have been rejected at each important stage criticism from within the fsln emerged the magazine envio for instance was founded in 1981 as a publication that provided critical support to nicaragua s revolutionary process from the perspective of liberation theology s option for the poor but such criticism was not actually taken into account by the leadership which was more and more dominated by daniel ortega his brother humberto and víctor tirado lópez all three of whom supported the tercerista faction which as was explained above did not have a full understanding of the necessity of self organization and was inclined to alliances with the bourgeoisie and were joined by tomas borge and bayardo arce of the prolonged people s war faction further the four other members of the national leadership did not form a bloc to oppose the continuation and deepening of the errors that were made it is very important to point out that proposals for alternative policies were formulated both inside the fsln and from outside from political groups who wanted to further the revolutionary process that was underway constructive critical voices did not wait for the electoral failure of february 1990 to propose new directions but they received only a limited hearing and remained relatively isolated illegitimate and odious debt the leadership of the fsln should also have questioned repayment of the public debt inherited from the somoza dictatorship and should have broken with the world bank and the imf as a dependent country aligned on the united states somoza s nicaragua had been a receiver of booming foreign lending in the 1970s by multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the imf as well as by international private banks while the loans were officially intended for development they benefitted the strengthening of an authoritarian regime and the increase in wealth of somoza and his clique after the latter left the country with most of their assets the new sandinista rulers of nicaragua were in dire need of funding in order to implement progressive policies and to encourage the industrialization of the country somoza s debt would soon be a burden and impede the implementation of such policies when the fsln took power the foreign debt stood at 1 5 billion and in 1981 its servicing represented 28 of the country s export revenue the sandinistas should have conducted an audit of the debt with broad citizen participation this is a fundamental point the sandinista government s agreeing to continue repaying the debt was in keeping with its defense of the interests of a part of nicaragua s bourgeoisie who had invested in the debt issued by somoza and borrowed money from u s banks for the sandinista government this was also a way of avoiding a confrontation with the world bank and the imf despite the fact that they had financed the dictatorship despite the government s efforts to maintain collaboration with the two institutions the latter decided to suspend financial relations with the new nicaraguan authorities this shows that it was useless to make concessions to them admittedly it was not easy for the government of a country like nicaragua to face its creditors alone but it could have begun by questioning the legitimacy of the debts claimed by the world bank the imf and the states and private banks that had financed the dictatorship the government could have launched an audit of these debts by calling for citizen participation and could have gained support for a demand for abolition of those debts by the broad international movement in support of the nicaraguan people instead in 1988 after the external debt had reached 7 billion the government went as far as implementing a structural adjustment plan that degraded the conditions of the poor without affecting the rich very much resembling the usual conditions imposed by the imf and world bank while these institutions had still not resumed their financial relations with nicaragua it can never be repeated often enough that a refusal to stand up to creditors who demand repayment of an illegitimate debt is generally the beginning of the abandonment of the program of change if the burden of illegitimate debt is not denounced the people are condemned to bear that burden in 1979 two months after the overthrow of somoza fidel castro said in a speech before the general assembly of the united nations the developing countries debt has already reached 335 billion it is estimated that the total payment for servicing the foreign debt amounts to more than 40 billion each year which represents more than 20 per cent of their annual exports furthermore the average per capita income in the developed countries is now 14 times greater than that of the underdeveloped countries this situation is already unbearable at the continental dialogue on the foreign debt held at havana s palace of conventions on august 3rd 1985 he said the debts of the countries with less relative development in a disadvantaged situation are unbearable and do not have a solution and they should be cancelled as part of a major international campaign for the abolition of illegitimate debt castro made a series of arguments at that conference that are quite applicable to nicaragua s case to all these moral political and economic reasons we can add many legal reasons who signed the contracts who is sovereign on the basis of what concept can it be said that the people committed themselves to paying and that they signed for the credits and received the credits most of those credits were secured by repressive military dictatorships that did not consult the people do the debts and the commitments of the peoples oppressors have to be paid by the oppressed this is the moral and philosophical basis of this idea the parliaments were not consulted the principle of sovereignty was violated what parliament participated in this debt signing process and knew about it we stress the issue of illegitimate debt because should the oppressive regime of daniel ortega and rosario murillo be overthrown it would be essential for a popular government to call repayment of the debt demanded of nicaragua into question should the right take leadership of the overthrow of the regime we can be certain that it will not call the debt repayment demanded of nicaragua into question after the defeat in the election of february 1990 daniel ortega extended a policy of class collaboration in 1989 the fsln government reached an agreement with the contras that put an end to fighting which was of course a positive development it was presented as the victorious outcome of the strategy that had been adopted yet it was a pyrrhic victory the sandinista leadership called a general election in february 1990 and felt certain it would win election results struck the sandinista leadership with an amazed wave of panic the right had won partly by threatening that fighting would resume if the fsln won many people wanted to avoid further bloodshed and thus reluctantly voted for the right hoping for an end to war for good some were also disappointed by the fsln government s policies in the countryside deficient agrarian reform and in cities negative consequences of the austerity measures enforced by the structural adjustment program begun in 1988 though sandinista organizations could still rely on a lot of support among young people workers and civil servants as well as among a significant number of farm labourers the sandinista leadership expected to reap 70 of the votes in the elections so it was flabbergasted as it hadn t perceived the growing discontent in a large portion of the population this illustrates the gap between the majority of the people and a leadership that had become used to giving orders after the defeat in the election of february 1990 daniel ortega adopted an attitude that swung back and forth between compromise with the government and confrontation the sandinista leadership with daniel and humberto ortega at its head negotiated the transition with violeta chamorro s new government humberto was still general in chief of a starkly reduced army the most left wing members of the army had been dismissed under the pretext that they had supplied missiles to the farabundo martí national liberation front fmln which was still attempting to bring about a general uprising in salvador in the context of presidents gorbachev and bush coming closer together soviet authorities had denounced the fact that sam 7 and sam 14 missiles that had been supplied by the ussr to the sandinistas had been passed on to the fmln and used to shoot down u s army helicopters operating in el salvador four sandinista officers were imprisoned on an order from humberto ortega with the following explanation blinded by their political passion and guided by extremist arguments this small group of officers flouted military honor and the institution s and military command s loyalty which is the same as flouting the sacred patriotic and revolutionary interests of nicaragua this led to strong criticism from the workers national front which included sandinista trade union organizations from the sandinista youth as well as from a number of fsln activists moreover a left wing group of former members of the prolonged people s war faction that published the bulletin nicaragua desde adentro disapproved of humberto ortega s decision to remain head of the army under a right wing presidency instead of leaving his position to his deputy who was also a member of the fsln so that humberto ortega could remain in the fsln leadership and join the political opposition to the new regime a few months after violeta chamorro started her mandate as president a massive movement spread throughout the country in july 1990 protesting massive layoffs planned in the public services as well as other issues linked with the implementation of a market oriented economic policy managua and other cities were covered with sandinista barricades and the trade unions launched a general strike this resulted in a compromise with violeta chamorro s government which was forced to withdraw some measures but the sandinista grassroots was disgruntled at the fsln leadership having halted protest actions later the front s leadership gradually made concessions to chamorro accepting the dismantling of the public banking sector the reduction of the public sector in both agriculture and manufacturing the end of the state s monopoly on foreign trade chamorro also organized the cleansing of the police force and incorporated former contras into it it must be said that after the victory of the right a significant part of the estates formerly expropriated from the somocistas after the 1979 victory were appropriated by a few sandinista leaders who consequently accessed to the role of capitalists this process was called piñata those who organized it accounted for it as meeting the need to secure assets for the fsln against a government that might want to confiscate the party s assets despite a radicalization of some elements of the fsln throughout 1990 and 1991 others such as former sandinista minister alejandro martinez cuenca openly mentioned the need for a co gobierno a kind of conditional external support to violeta chamorro s government and supported the policy enforced by the international monetary fund which to some extent could be perceived as in line with the policy followed by the sandinista government from 1988 éric toussaint was a first hand eyewitness to such class collaborationist policies advocated for by daniel ortega and other flsn leaders in 1992 as a participant in the 3rd forum of são paulo in managua in 1992 éric toussaint accompanied ernest mandel a leader of the fourth international who had been invited to deliver the inaugural speech at the 3rd forum of são paulo the forum launched in 1990 by brazil s workers party in portuguese partido dos trabalhadores pt under lula da silva s leadership brought together a broad spectrum of the latin american left from the cuban cp to the frente amplio of uruguay and including guerrilla organizations like the fmln in el salvador ernest mandel entitled his speech socialism and the future beginning with an observation of the great difficulties facing the forces of the radical left worldwide he stated that priority had to be given to emphasizing demands aimed at attaining fundamental human rights while at the same time maintaining the perspective of socialism in his conclusion he stressed that this socialism must be self managing feminist ecological radical pacifist pluralistic it must qualitatively extend democracy and be internationalist and pluralist including in terms of multiparty system the emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves it cannot be done by states governments parties supposedly infallible leaders or experts of any kind during the forum víctor tirado lópez one of the commandants who were closest to daniel ortega at that time asked to have a private meeting with ernest mandel who asked éric toussaint to accompany him víctor tirado lópez began by saying that he had much admiration for ernest mandel s work and in particular his marxist economic theory then the commandant expounded his analysis of the international situation according to him the capitalist system had reached maturity and would undergo no further crises and would lead to socialism without the need for further revolutions this was totally absurd and ernest mandel said so very clearly and with emotion when mandel then responded that crises would indeed continue and that in certain parts of latin america such as brazil s northeast living conditions were clearly worsening for the most exploited populations tirado lópez answered that those regions had not yet been reached by the civilization that had been brought by christopher columbus five centuries earlier ernest mandel and éric toussaint then put an abrupt end to this preposterous conversation the following day daniel ortega expressed the desire to meet in private with mandel to present the proposed alternative program he wanted to defend publicly as the fsln against the rightist government of violeta chamorro after reading it we realized that the program did not meet the minimum conditions for constituting an alternative to put it simply it was compatible with the reforms undertaken by the rightist government and would not enable the offensive against the right to be resumed mandel said so very clearly to daniel ortega who was not at all pleased these two discussions show how profoundly certain fsln leaders had gone astray the subsequent evolution of daniel ortega and those who accompanied him on his path back to power was already clearly perceptible in the early 1990s daniel ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln a large part of the sandinista militants from the revolutionary period rejected that orientation in the years that followed it took time and daniel ortega took advantage of the slow dawning of awareness of the danger to consolidate his influence within the fsln and marginalize or exclude those who defended a different orientation simultaneously daniel ortega succeeded in maintaining privileged relations with a number of leaders of popular sandinista organizations who felt that in the absence of anyone else he was the leader most likely to defend the series of gains made during the 1980s that explains in part why in 2018 the ortega regime still has the support of part of the population and the popular movement despite its use of extremely brutal methods of repression ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln in the 1990s is best summed up by mónica baltodano former guerilla commander former member of the fsln leadership and now a member of the movement for the rescue of sandinismo in spanish movimiento por el rescate del sandinismo mprs the dispute within the fsln between 1993 and 1995 persuaded ortega and his iron circle of the importance of controlling the party apparatus that became more concretized precisely in the fsln s 1998 congress in which what remained of the national directorate i e the sandinista assembly and the fsln congress itself were replaced with an assembly whose participants were mainly the leaders of the grassroots organizations loyal to ortega little by little even that assembly stopped meeting at that point an important rupture occurred by then it was already evident that ortega was increasingly distancing himself from leftist positions and centering his strategy on how to expand his power his emphasis was power for power s sake mónica baltodano goes on to explain the building of alliances that ultimately led to daniel ortega s coming back to the presidential office an alliance building process started then to increase his power the first was with president arnoldo alemán which produced the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 ortega s central aims in that alliance were to reduce the percentage needed to win the presidential elections on the first round divvy up between their two parties the top posts in all state institutions and guarantee security to the fsln leaders personal properties and businesses in exchange he guaranteed alemán governability by putting a stop to strikes and other struggles for grassroots demands the fsln stopped opposing the neoliberal policies in the following years the main leaders of the party s once mass organizations became national assembly representatives or were brought into the structures of ortega s circle of power with that they obviously stopped resisting and struggling for all the things they had once believed in those years also saw the forming of ties i wouldn t call it an alliance with the head of the catholic church cardinal obando the main purpose of that linkage was control of the electoral branch of government through obando s personal intimate relation with roberto rivas who had been heading the electoral branch since 2000 it also bought ortega increased influence with both the catholic faithful and the church hierarchy after alemán was charged with corruption and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment the agreement he had concluded with ortega proved to be profitable ortega saw to it that the men he had placed in the judicial system arranged preferential treatment for alemán allowing him to serve out his sentence in house arrest later in 2009 two years after his election as president of nicaragua daniel ortega gave his support to the supreme court s decision to quash alemán s conviction and release him a few days later alemán returned the favor by ensuring that the parliamentary group of the liberal party he led voted for the election of a sandinista at the head of the national assembly the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 reduced the percentage needed to win the presidential election on the first round to 35 of the votes if the candidate has a 5 margin over the candidate coming in second ortega was elected with 38 07 of the votes in november 2006 and took office in january 2007 he was re elected in november 2011 and in november 2016 after what rosario murillo whom he had married in the church with cardinal obando as officiant and who had been spokesperson of the government since 2007 became vice president the revolution betrayed since 2007 the policies which have been implemented by ortega and murillo have looked more like a continuation of the policies pursued by the three right wing governments that succeeded one another between 1990 and 2007 than like a continuation of the sandinista experience from 1979 1990 in this respect the article by mónica baltodano published in january 2014 and quoted above deserves a full reading in the last eleven years daniel ortega s government did not carry out any structural reform no socialization of the banks no new agrarian reform despite the very important concentration of land in the hands of big landowners no urban reform in favor of the toiling classes no tax reform in favor of more social justice free trade zone regimes have been expanded the contracting of internal and external debt has been pursued under the same conditions that favor the creditors through the interest payments they receive and that allow them to impose policies in their favor through blackmail in 2006 the sandinista parliamentary group voted hand in hand with the right wing mps in favor of a law totally prohibiting abortion it was under the presidency of daniel ortega who refused to call the measure into question that the prohibition was included in the new criminal code that entered into force in july 2008 there are no exceptions whatsoever to the prohibition including cases of danger to the health or the life of the pregnant woman or pregnancy resulting from rape this retrograde legislation was accompanied by serious attacks on organizations defending women s rights who have been among the most active in the opposition to the ortega government in another very troubling development references to the catholic religion have been systematically used by the regime in particular by rosario murillo who has made a point of denouncing women s rights organizations and the support they receive from abroad in their struggle for the right to abortion as being the devil s work nicaragua can still be characterized by its very low wages pronicaragua the official agency promoting foreign investment in the country brags about he minimum wage the most competitive at the regional level which makes nicaragua an ideal country to set up labour intensive operations over the recent years labour insecurity starkly increased informal economy represented 60 of the total employment in 2009 a figure which stood at 80 in 2017 no progress was made toward a diminution of social inequalities and the number of millionaires increased the growth in wealth produced was not distributed to the toiling classes but benefitted the big national and international capital with the help of daniel ortega s government furthermore the latter and his family also became richer the main trigger of the social protests that started in april 2018 was the announcement by ortega s government of neoliberal measures to be taken concerning social security in particular pension reform these measures were advocated for by the imf with which ortega had maintained excellent relations since he took office in 2007 in a statement published in february 2018 the imf congratulated the government for its achievements economic performance in 2017 was above expectations and the 2018 outlook is favorable staff recommends that the inss reform plan secures its long term viability and corrects the inequities within the system staff welcomes the authorities efforts to alleviate inss financing needs the most unpopular measures were a 5 decrease of the pensions meant to finance medical expenses and a limitation of the annual indexation of these pensions over the inflation rate future pension benefits for the close to one million workers affiliated to the pension system were meant to be based on a less favorable calculation which would have resulted in cuts in pension benefits that could have been as high as 13 these measures sparked a mass protest movement at first mainly composed of students and young people the movement quickly joined with other protests in particular with the mainly peasant and indigenous based movement against the construction of a transoceanic canal meant as an alternative to the panama canal that would endanger large parts of the environment and livelihoods eventually ortega gave up on these reforms this was not before he had initiated a criminal spiral of repression which resulted in more than 300 protesters being killed by security forces and pro regime militiamen now joined by parts of the population horrified by the government s repressive response the protests radicalized eventually demanding the fall of the regime the government accused the protesters of being right wing golpistas and terrorists working toward regime change with the support of u s imperialism the government was however unable to provide any non fabricated evidence to support such claims in fact the united states which has little to say about ortega s neoliberal economic policies took rather timid sanctions in reaction to the repression so far similarly the examination by the u s senate of the nicaraguan investment conditionality act nica of 2017 which deserves to be denounced as an imperialist policy impinging on nicaragua s national sovereignty was not sped up during the events of spring 2018 it finally passed the senate as late as end of november 2018 and became a law on 20 december 2018 furthermore ortega and murillo strengthened their use of religious fundamentalist references and denounced the protesters as having satanic rituals and practices as opposed to the rest of the nicaraguan people because the nicaraguan people are god s people on 19 july 2018 during the rally organized on the anniversary of the sandinista revolution to try and strengthen his legitimacy ortega repeated these absurd claims and called on the catholic bishops to exorcize the protesters and chase out the devil which supposedly had taken possession of them by the middle of july the policy of terror led by the government allowed the latter to regain control of the streets since then massive arrests have taken place and several hundreds of people labelled as terrorists by the government are still imprisoned human rights associations are not permitted to enter the prisons nor are the lawyers of some of the detainees some of them were tortured and forced to give false confessions supporting the claim according to which the regime faces a foreign led plot aimed at removing it by force by means of conclusion the sandinista revolution started as an extraordinary experience of social liberation and renewal of national dignity in a dependent country whose status as a backyard for u s imperialism had been accepted by its authoritarian dynastic rulers for decades the achievements of the sandinista government between 1979 and 1990 however did not go far enough while they allowed for significant improvements of the living conditions of most of the nicaraguans they did not break with the export oriented extractivist model which was dominated by the big capital nor did they significantly promote the active participation of the masses in the economic and political decision making processes the political institutions and the internal organization of the fsln were not developed as tools that could have empowered the masses an error which allowed for the fsln degeneration during ortega s road back to power this understanding of the nicaraguan revolution and its degeneration stresses the need for revolutionaries and socialist activists to encourage the broadest possible participation of the masses in the fight for their emancipation as well as to help ensure their self organization a corollary to this idea is the need for revolutionaries to struggle against the bureaucratization of their organizations leadership which begins with building organizations that respect internal democracy this was strongly underestimated by the fsln which remained a political military organization after it had seized power and waited until 1991 before it organized its first congress as a political organization while the sandinista leadership made the right choice when it recognized the victory of the right in 1990 the subsequent steps taken by the fsln leadership under daniel ortega were clearly meant for him to come back to power for power s sake the left wing of the fsln which organized as critical currents during the 1990s was too timid in its opposition to these moves finally the international left needs to have a materialist analysis of social and political processes and shall not cling to fantasized ideas of experiences of really existing socialism the evolution of the fsln and the policies led in nicaragua since 2007 should be analyzed for what they are rather than on the basis of what daniel ortega and rosario murillo presumably stood for as fsln activists during the 1970s and 1980s in this sense ortega and murillo s deepening of the neoliberal policies pursued by their right wing predecessors as well as their total ban of abortion should be denounced by the international left furthermore the left should strongly denounce the criminal repression currently organized by the regime against protesters and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners when adopting such a stance the left should in no way compromise itself by supporting a right wing pro imperialist opposition on the contrary this stance should be accompanied by an effort to link with and reinforce the critical sandinistas and other members of the progressive opposition to ortega and murillo in particular the youth who mobilized strongly since april 2018 the feminist movement and the peasant and indigenous movement who opposed the project of transoceanic canal and other destructive projects linked with the export led capitalist model this article first published on the international viewpoint org website nathan legrand is an internationalist activist and a member of the committee for the abolition of third world debt cadtm in belgium
but not all analysts are convinced the formula will work as well the third time around in the first place chinese policymakers are likely to be much more cautious in applying the stimulus the previous two stimulus programs led to an explosion in china s corporate debt over the past decade to the point where debt owed by non financial firms now stands at 170 per cent of gross domestic product the highest level among leading economies this perilously high debt burden means chinese policymakers are reluctant to spark a further round of borrowing by debt laden state owned companies and local governments trade skirmishes but there is another much more pressing consideration that the pboc must keep in mind as it weighs up monetary easing advertisement washington and beijing are engaged in terse trade negotiations aimed at averting a full scale trade war that means the pboc must move very tentatively when it comes to monetary easing for fear of sending the yuan sharply lower the trump administration has repeatedly warned china against using a weaker currency to gain a competitive advantage as a result the last thing beijing wants to do now is to irritate washington by allowing the chinese currency to weaken through the psychologically important level of seven yuan per us dollar the yuan is at present trading at 6 86 to the us dollar this extreme sensitivity about the exchange rate limits the extent to which the pboc can ease monetary policy in response to flagging economic activity the chinese central bank can t afford to cut benchmark interest rates for example for fear that such an escalation of monetary stimulus would trigger capital outflows which would put downward pressure on the yuan indeed some analysts believe the pboc s determination to prop up the yuan against the greenback which forces the bank to buy yuan and sell us dollars has resulted in tighter chinese monetary conditions they point out that the growth in the country s m2 money supply continues to dwindle falling to 8 per cent year over year in november and matching the lowest annual growth rate in at least two decades advertisement since economic activity depends on the availability of money and credit this sharp slowdown in m2 growth which has been been consistently in the teens or 20s for the past decade bodes ill for a pick up in economic activity quantitative tightening in his latest newsletter independent investment strategist russell napier points out that the chinese central bank just like its us counterpart is now in the process of shrinking the size of its balance sheet in the us this process is known as quantitative tightening or qt in november 2018 the pboc s assets contracted by 0 94 per cent year on year they have contracted by 2 0 per cent since august 2018 the key driver of such a contraction occurs as the pboc enters the foreign exchange market to prevent the exchange rate deviating from its target rate napier writes premier li keqiang has ordered three major state owned banks to increase their lending to small privately owned businesses qilai shen a contraction in assets means a contraction in liabilities and if we look at the specific liability that is key in determining domestic liquidity reserve money it has contracted by 0 4 per cent year on year and 4 9 per cent from its peak in december 2017 that s qt advertisement napier calculates that that since chinese bank reserves hit their peak at the end of 2017 about us233 billion in liquidity has been drained from the chinese banking system this is about half the us469 billion decline in the total reserves of the us banking system over the same period as the us federal reserve has progressively reduced the size of its massive bond portfolio but napier argues there is a huge difference in the impact of the us and the chinese quantitative tightenings that is because the fed s qt is reducing the level of excess reserves in the banking system whereas the pboc s qt is reducing the level of fully utilised reserves in their banking system some analysts believe the pboc s determination to prop up the yuan against the greenback has resulted in tighter chinese monetary conditions tomohiro ohsumi as a result he argues the monetary impact of china s qt should thus be much more powerful than us qt as it should directly impact the ability of chinese commercial banks to expand their balance sheets napier notes that the contraction in bank reserves is beginning to show up in higher market interest rates since august 2018 the three month shibor rate the interest rate at which banks lend to other banks in the shanghai interbank market has climbed from 2 79 per cent to a peak of 3 39 per cent the three month shibor rate is now about 3 1 per cent advertisement as napier points out if monetary policy is about the price and quantity of money china s broad money growth is at the lowest level recorded at least since world war ii and the price of money is rising change in monetary policy in the second half of 2018 he argues market action began to reflect this tightening in chinese monetary policy chinese interest rates rose china s money supply growth slowed commodity prices declined chinese manufacturing was contracting by year end global growth expectations declined and the valuation of global growth assets shifted decidedly lower napier predicts that chinese monetary policy tightening will continue this year unless the chinese central bank abandons efforts to prop up the currency or the country sees a sudden large inflow of foreign capital but he warns previous episodes of chinese qt have been painful the last contraction in pboc assets was from february 2015 to december of that year and the msci world index declined by 19 per cent from its 2015 high to its low in the first quarter of 2016 the impact of commodity prices was even greater with the price of crude down 57 per cent advertisement but as napier notes back then markets were reacting only to chinese qt now they have to deal with the double whammy of chinese qt at a time when the fed s balance sheet is shrinking by us50 billion a month while the fed can stop qt the pboc can only stop should it see a sudden and major improvement in its external accounts or should it abandon its exchange rate policy the former looks unlikely making the latter very probable it s a classic catch 22 dilemma for chinese policymakers until beijing allows the chinese currency to float freely the chinese central bank will have limited room for any manoeuvre when it comes to monetary easing but napier warns a weaker yuan will produce initially major deflationary consequences in the us and across the world
emerging developing economies should rebuild policy buffers boost productivity to sustain growth washington january 8 2019 global economic growth is projected to soften from a downwardly revised 3

gap with advanced economies in about 35 percent of emerging market and developing economies in 2019 with the share increasing to 60 percent in countries affected by fragility conflict and violence a number of developments could act as a further brake on activity a sharper tightening in borrowing costs could depress capital inflows and lead to slower growth in many emerging market and developing economies past increases in public and private debt could heighten vulnerability to swings in financing conditions and market sentiment intensifying trade tensions could result in weaker global growth and disrupt globally interconnected value chains robust economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity said world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions ceyla pazarbasioglu as the outlook for the global economy has darkened strengthening contingency planning facilitating trade and improving access to finance will be crucial to navigate current uncertainties and invigorate growth analytical chapters address key current topics the informal sector accounts for about 70 percent of employment and 30 percent of gdp in emerging market and developing economies since it is associated with lower productivity and tax revenues and greater poverty and inequality this is symptomatic of opportunities lost reducing tax and regulatory burdens improving access to finance offering better education and public services and strengthening public revenue frameworks could level the playing field between formal and informal sectors debt vulnerabilities in low income countries are rising while borrowing has enabled many countries to tackle important development needs the median debt to gdp ratio of low income countries has climbed and the composition of debt has shifted toward more expensive market based sources of financing these economies should focus on mobilizing domestic resources strengthening debt and investment management practices and building more resilient macro fiscal frameworks sustaining historically low and stable inflation is not guaranteed in emerging market and developing economies cyclical pressures that have depressed inflation over the past decade are gradually dissipating the long term factors that have helped reduce inflation over the past five decades global trade and financial integration widespread adoption of robust monetary policy frameworks may lose momentum or reverse maintaining low global inflation may become as much of a challenge as achieving it policies aimed at softening the blow of global food price swings can have unintended consequences if implemented by many governments in uncoordinated fashion government interventions can provide short term relief but widespread actions are likely to exacerbate food price spikes with heaviest impact on the poor for example trade policies introduced during the 2010 11 food price spike may have accounted for more than one quarter of the increase in the world price of wheat and maize the 2010 11 food price spike tipped 8 3 million people almost 1 percent of the world s poor into poverty designing tax and social policies to level the playing field for formal and informal sectors as well as strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and debt management will be important priorities for policymakers to overcome the

by nathan morley the centre of frankfurt erupted with fireworks and cheers at the stroke of midnight back on jan 4 1999 as a common european currency was launched now almost a generation later celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the euro have been largely muted for many young europeans the currencies it replaced like the franc deutschmark guilder and lira are learned about in history classes when introduced the euro was first adopted by just 11 member states and widely considered a political as well as an economic decision european commission president jean claude juncker one of the only signatories of the maastricht treaty still politically active today remembered the hard fought and momentous negotiations on the launch of the economic and monetary union constant turmoil but the fights and battles had only just begun its fiercest critics charged abandoning age old national currencies was a monumental mistake opponents said slapping a common currency on diverse economies with a single interest rate and different levels of productivity disabled national governments from properly managing their own economies but brushing aside reservations new eu member countries adopted the euro including slovenia cyprus malta slovakia estonia latvia and lithuania its growth though in many ways was hamstrung by opposition especially from sweden denmark and britain which all rejected it in favor of their own currencies reservations were fuelled to a certain degree by financial crises in italy cyprus ireland and portugal where the explosive combination of high borrowing costs and moribund growth leading to strict austerity budgets but it was in greece where the fragility of the currency was really demonstrated in 2010 the eu and the international monetary fund were forced to bail out the debt ridden country ironically greece was initially excluded from joining the euro in 1999 because of its weak economy soon after the crisis in greece the euro plunged below 1 20 u s dollars then as if things couldn t get any worse spain s long term interest rate rocketed above 7 6 percent in 2012 causing panic about the possibility of a euro collapse in that short amount of time spectators viewed a continent and currency in perpetual disarray many financial experts remained equally reserved about the success of the currency given that for the best part of the last two decades eurozone gdp growth per capita continued to lag behind britain and the united states troubles didn t end with spain and greece in the summer of 2014 the currency surged to near 1 40 dollars immediately hitting valued export markets but maintaining its unpredictability it then plunged to 1 05 dollars a drop linked to the purchase of assets by the european central bank to prop up the economy the following year athens sucked dry by austerity was granted an unprecedented third bailout a move designed to keep it in the single currency despite some calls in greece for a return to the drachma mixed feelings the financial woes were epitomized by views about the currency which swang from blind allegiance to blind hatred then of course with growing economic disparities within the bloc came the prospect of increasing hostility between member states but despite almost constant challenges the euro has been more resilient than anyone including its proponents could have dreamed still as 2019 opens there are real and legitimate debates about its success and future for juncker the financial foundation of the euro is stable he maintains the currency has matured into a symbol of unity sovereignty and stability whilst it is true that the euro is now a solid reserve currency kept by central banks and the international monetary fund reasons for concern remain arising in no small measure from the looming exit of the united kingdom from the eu then a shaky relationship between italy and the european union has caused jitters and threatening eurozone stability italy which is the third largest economy in the eurozone has a rocketing deficit and has been embroiled in a drawn out battle with brussels over its latest budget there are other areas where the euro has been frustrated the recent u s sanctions slapped on iran highlighted how crude oil prices remain pegged to the dollar meaning any attempt to circumvent the dollar as payment would be fraught with complications the european union which opposed the sanctions on iran has been exasperated with dollar s dominance in the oil trade in fact last september juncker bemoaned the absurdity of europe paying 80 percent of its energy import bill in dollars when only roughly 2 percent of the eu s energy imports come from the united states he also lamented that it was absurd that european companies buy european planes in dollars instead of euro but there is some succour for eu leaders as a recent euro barometer survey suggests that 64 percent europeans believe the introduction of the euro was a good idea surprisingly

higher than the highest debt deeper than the deepest trap yes this should be the new slogan of pakistan china s so called all weather friendship now that china s sinister objectives behind the china pakistan economic corridor cpec have been exposed pakistani prime minister imran khan with premier li keqiang in beijing capital of pakistan s all weather ally photo reuters according to a report documents of the ministry of planning and development have revealed that pakistan will pay china 40 billion for the 26 5 billion cpec investments in 20 years this figure doesn t include the 8 2 billion mainline i project of pakistan railways the only project that can materialise in the next few years according to the report advertisement pakistan s ministry of finance has shown these documents to the international monetary fund imf during bailout negotiations so they apparently tried their best to hide the total cost of the dollar wasting and anti economy projects also recently an official of the planning ministry contradicted the chinese ambassador yao jing the official stated the total cost of 22 ongoing and completed power projects under cpec was 28 6 billion dollars while jing had stated the figure to be 19 billion this 9 billion discrepancy between the figures arose because the ambassador did not include the cost of the kohala power project the 300 megawatt gwadar power plant and the oracle power plant the chinese ambassador did not include the cost of major projects such as the gwadar power plant photo reuters from 62 billion to 40 billion how the report has raised many questions over the cost of the cpec one is why had the ministry of planning and development estimated 40 billion as the total cost of the project in fact in april 2017 the governor of sindh muhammad zubair announced as reported by the express tribune that china had approved additional financing for infrastructure projects under the cpec taking the investment volume to 62 billion from 55 billion advertisement a reason behind this discrepancy could be that the planning and development ministry did not include the funds that have not actually been dispatched by the chinese all for the sake of building trust in the heart of the imf which always raises concerns over chinese intentions behind cpec a total of 39 83 billion precisely the exact figure quoted by the planning and development ministry is 39 83 bn out of this debt repayments of energy and infrastructure projects consist of 28 bn and the remaining 11 3 bn will be paid as dividends to investors the project can be divided into two parts 1 infrastructure schemes and 2 power plant projects infrastructure projects are being set up by the government of pakistan and thus the burden of repaying chinese loans for them will be on the government s shoulders as far as power projects are concerned these are based on a new kind of ipp independent power producers mode a twist which we will discuss later on in this article china has issued loans of 5 9 billion to the government of pakistan at interest rates ranging from 2 to 5 2 three government loans approx 800 million have been obtained at 5 2 there are a total of five infrastructure projects for which pakistan will return 7 5 billion to chinese government advertisement there are a total of 18 power plant projects commercial loans for setting up power plants have been arranged at an interest rate of london interbank offer rate libor plus 4 5 however it is the return on equity which in some cases is as high as 34 2 that will cause an outflow of 11 3 billion from pakistan s economy to the chinese economy the twist or the chinese debt trap equipment building material and services labour for the cpec are all to be imported from china furthermore a majority almost all of the companies that will invest in pakistan s energy sector are headquartered in china the banks which will provide these chinese companies investors billions of dollars to invest in pakistan s power sector are also chinese and these are not private banks but state owned chinese banks mainly the exim bank of china and the china development bank so what is the twist here there is indeed one and let us discuss it now you may ask what the ipp mode is according to pakistan s private power and infrastructure board s ppib website due to the intense energy crisis in the country and the fact that the government of pakistan wasn t able to afford spending on electricity projects in order to tackle the situation it created a one window facilitator ppib to promote private investment in the power sector on its behalf and from there the concept of ipp surfaced there is nothing wrong in inviting private investment in the country which on the one hand can inject foreign currency especially dollars fdi into the economy and on the other help the government address the power crisis which will stabilise the economy by saving industries and increase the living standard of the masses so a private investor can invest and get return on the equity as simple as that yeah but it only works like that in a normal case the process has been twisted for ipps working under the china pakistan economic corridor cpec according to the agreement on cpec energy projects cooperation the government of pakistan is legally bound to ensure the provision of foreign currency dollars for debt repayment to chinese financial institutions mainly state owned banks by investors which are chinese companies for the repatriation of profits return on equity by them chinese investors thus other than the dollars that will leave pakistan and enter china in the shape of dividend to the chinese ipps in the cpec more dollars will leave the economy in the shape of foreign reserves that the government is legally obliged to provide to these chinese ipps so that they can pay the loans back to the state owned banks of china ultimately the country already suffering from a shortage of dollar reserves pakistan will end up pouring a substantial amount into the chinese economy and will find itself knocking the doors of the imf world bank saudis emitaries eu usa uk and china for a bailout once again the consequences will be much more severe if the country goes bankrupt in the future these projects will not create jobs for pakistanis as the labourers must necessarily come from china photo metallurgical corp of china ltd the cpec won t contribute to the development of pakistan s industrial and technological sector nor it will generate jobs for the people of pakistan chinese hire their own people article 6 of the agreement says pakistani party agrees to provide each year during project s operation period through the state bank of pakistan for all of the company s transactions related to the project that require foreign currency in case such foreign currency is not available through authorized banks in pakistan pakistani party commits initiating a mechanism for expeditious conversion of revenue of power plants the story doesn t end here article 3 of the agreement reportedly promises tax exemption of interest income accruing from the commercial loans by the chinese commercial banks this means that pakistan has apparently foregone tax on 4 42 billion profit that chinese financial institutions would earn on 15 42 billion loans for the energy projects to protect chinese investment from any adverse impact of the circular debt the bilateral agreement also apparently includes article 5 which ensures that a revolving account will be opened within a month of commercial operations of a power project into which an amount will be deposited by the pakistani government no less than 22 of the monthly payments for the respective power projects why is china doing so pakistan will have to return all of the 40 billion to china in a period of 20 years the government of pakistan has still not made each and every detail of the cpec agreements public right now all we have is the information reported by some media outlets the project will surely be extended and in future the total cost of it will be close to 62 billion or even more what i can say after analysing the information is that the cpec is a trap set for pakistan by its all weather ally xi jinping is lending pakistan billions of dollars for infrastructure not free of cost at high interest rates pakistan then imports equipment raw materials and labour from china using the same dollars so what comes from china goes back to china with huge interest another manchurian candidate a chinese restaurant in islamabad establishments are cropping up to cater to the growing chinese population in pakistan photo reuters file furthermore as far as power projects are concerned which form the larger portion of the entire debt trap chinese state owned banks are providing billions of dollars in loans to chinese investors which then invest these dollars in pakistan s energy sector and in return they get share from the profit in shape of dollars dividend also the government of pakistan is legally obliged to ensure the availability of dollars for these chinese investors so that they can pay back the loans they took from china s state owned banks thus what comes from china goes back to china with everything else therefore pakistan by 2037 38 the deadline to repay cpec loans and pay dividends may find itself short of dollar reserves and will possibly default on repayments and dividend payments no one knows the details of collaterals which china will seize if pakistan defaults on the obligations but we do know what china has done with other belt and road initiative bri partners sri lanka was forced to hand over the hambantota port to china when it wasn t able to repay 1

in his 2019 new year address china s paramount leader xi jinping used one key word that didn t appear in his 2018 new year address challenges he also used a famous slogan from the mao zedong era at a time when communist china then an isolated poor closed country vowed to catch up with the uk and the united states in 15 years rely on ourselves live a plain life and struggle hard xi also said taking a broad view of the whole world we are facing a period of drastic and unprecedented change that has not been seen in 100 years no matter how the international situation changes china s confidence and determination in defending its national sovereignty and security will never change for some savvy china observers and experts what lies between the lines of xi s speech are his realization of how seriously bad the situation in china is now and that an arduous struggle lies ahead among unprecedented challenges while xi didn t identify any specific challenges commentators and experts around the world have helped him to name a few and the following are some of what they listed challenge 1 mounting pressure of trade war in a shocking internal speech on dec 15 2018 xiang songzuo the former chief economist at the agricultural bank of china former deputy director at the people s bank of china and deputy director and senior fellow of the center for international monetary research at china s renmin university sharply criticized the loud claims made early in the year that americans are lifting rocks only to have them smash their own feet xiang asked where are those people now according to xiang the chinese regime made grave misjudgments about the trade war and needs to think hard about it a cargo ship is seen at a port in qingdao in eastern china s shandong province on oct 12 2018 china s trade surplus with the united states ballooned to a record 34 1 billion in september despite a raft of u s tariffs official data showed on oct 12 adding fuel to the spiraling trade war str afp getty images as a matter of fact the trade frictions the trade war between china and the u s is no longer a trade war or an economic war but a serious conflict between chinese and american values xiang said we can be very assured that the china u s relationship is now at a crossroads and is under a tremendous and historical test so far i don t think we ve found a real solution xiang said we used to have a phrase the strategic favorable stage for china s economic growth do we still have a strategic favorable stage i personally think it s fading very quickly many economists believe the trade war s negative effects on china s economy are yet to be seen challenge 2 economic plunge and poorly performing stock market in the same speech on dec 15 xiang made another shocking statement that according to an important research institute china s gdp growth wasn t the officially claimed 6 5 percent but was as low as 1 67 percent using another system of measurement the gdp growth was negative cheng xiaonong holds a doctorate in sociology from a chinese university and studies china s politics and economy he wrote in a chinese commentary piece that the important research institute referred to by xiang couldn t be any company or bank as they wouldn t dare to do such research or release such figures the source would need to be a governmental body higher than the national bureau

china could be heading for a full blown trade war following tit for tat tariff threats afp getty images cheng said that for any country the three main engines that drive an economy are consumption investment and export before 2009 export had been the major engine for the chinese economy but that engine has since slowed even without the trade war it wouldn t work well with costs rising and a large number of factories moving out of china since 2009 investment has been the biggest driver of the chinese economy but that also has come to a dead end with enough newly built buildings to satisfy market demand for the next 20 years cheng said at the same time the actual growth rate of consumption dropped to 2 percent in 2018 from 24 percent in 2005 and that trend is set to continue cheng says that with all three engines performing poorly the chinese economy has nowhere to go except downward with a 2 4 trillion loss china s stock market earned the title of the world s worst for 2018 tang

the costs of health and senior care rising ordinary chinese people are having a hard time making ends meet if the employment situation becomes worse more enterprises will close down more financial bubbles will burst and a large number of ordinary citizens will lose their incomes and assets more activities defending people s rights might appear throughout china and the regime would surely use

speech to mark the 40th anniversary of the all these pressures will continue to be felt by the communist regime in 2019 on jan 2 xi jinping delivered a firmly worded speech to mark the 40th anniversary of the message of compatriots in taiwan when on jan 1 1979 china offered to open communications and stop military action against the island the people s liberation army storms ashore from landing craft in an exercise on the mainland coast close to taiwan on sept 10 1999 str afp getty images xi said that taiwan s unification with mainland china is inevitable and he issued a stern warning against any separatists or independence attempts china must and will be united said xi we make no promise to give up the use of force and reserve the option of all necessary means toward unification responded the same day showing an even tougher stance by not only calling upon china to bravely move towards democracy but also openly denouncing the 1992 consensus taiwan s president tsai ing wen the same day showing an even tougher stance by not only calling upon china to bravely move towards democracy but also openly denouncing the 1992 consensus tsai was referring to a 1992 understanding whether an agreement was reached is in dispute in which china and taiwan agreed to the principle of one china including the mainland and taiwan with the provision that china and taiwan would interpret that principle differently in 2018 news about the people s liberation army s pla air force and ships circling taiwan sometimes with bombers and fighters was often reported from a military point of view that indicates the pla is preparing for possible attacks on taiwan wen zhao said so they have to become familiar with the future battleground to liberate or unify taiwan has been part of the dream for several generations of chinese communist party ccp leaders how far will the chinese regime go after the latest round of exchanging sharp words time will tell but according to tang hao one thing is certain the ccp intends to interfere in taiwan s 2020 presidential election in a comprehensive and intensive manner how will this affect the relationship between the ccp and taiwan will the conflicts be upgraded to another level another factor is that since trump took office several u s laws related to taiwan have been passed including the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2019 taiwan travel act and asia reassurance initiative act of 2018 these laws sent the ccp a very clear message that the united states won t give up its responsibilities toward taiwan or tolerate the ccp s provocative activities and that adds another dimension to the taiwan challenge the ccp faces in 2019 challenge 10 increasing possibilities of geopolitical clashes with the us trump wrote on twitter on dec 28 that he just had a long and very good call with president xi of china and that the deal is moving along very well this statement doesn t change the fact that the values of the united states and the ccp are fundamentally different on dec 18 xi claimed we will reform when we can and won t change anything that cannot be changed whatsoever can the clashes over basic core values be defused in the near future at the same time tang hao wrote that tensions in the south china sea and the uncertainty over the denuclearization of north korea may add tensions to the ongoing trade war would all these factors plus possible military friction with taiwan form a perfect storm for the ccp in 2019 and result in unexpected military tensions with the united states at this point tang comes to the same conclusion as xi 2019 will be a year full of risks for china and might also be a year when drastic changes occur

history facing down the worst recession in 70 years now idaho is the fastest growing state in the country let us honor his legacy by keeping our budget balanced while investing in the future thank you for your service governor otter i stand here today not to reminisce about idaho s past but to look to our future as governor i will seek to reflect our shared idaho values and aspirations this means making decisions through one lens the lens of ensuring the best possible opportunities for us our children and grandchildren to remain in idaho and enjoy our unparalleled quality of life making decisions with a long term perspective means staying focused on creating a regulatory and tax environment where idahoans can get good paying jobs it means having world class schools it means delivering accessible and affordable healthcare it means giving citizens a reason to be confident in state government by making government responsive transparent and accountable my team of agency directors and administrators is mostly in place a requirement for each of them is a commitment to implementing our shared vision of creating the best possible opportunities for idahoans to prosper i m humbled by their willingness to serve idaho i d like them to stand and be recognized from boundary to bear lake counties and letha to leadore i can tell you with confidence the state of our state is strong idahoans incomes are the fastest growing in america we have the highest number of people employed in our state s history due to the good work of the folks in this room idaho remains a model for fiscal responsibility there is no shortage of success stories that reflect the strength of our state s economy woodgrain millworks a fruitland based family owned company operates sawmills and manufactures doors and windows under kelly dame the company recently expanded in nampa they acquired and modernized the old sawmill in emmett assisting in our efforts for forest health the dame sons brooks taylor and tanner created proof eyewear they took a small company they started in their garage and now sell wooden sunglasses in more than 20 countries the family typifies the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in idaho in idaho falls brad lapray founded biologiq to create a useful plastic from the excess starch produced during potato processing biologiq has grown from a simple concept into an industry leading sustainable bioplastics provider it is another example of an innovative idaho company using waste and turning it into a thriving business in coeur d alene cody peterson and andy huska founded rohinni a homegrown micro led manufacturer that s become a leading technology company they design robots that install lots of tiny led lights on everyday electronic gear their business is diversifying idaho s economy adding to our growing tech sector and providing high wage careers in arco dragon fly tarps manufactures custom tarps for the outdoor industry the company just moved from the local business incubation center and continues to grow these companies and many others across idaho ultimately offer our kids more opportunities to stay home or come back to idaho our state is on an incredible trajectory with your help i intend to lead us to the next level making decisions with a long term perspective means state government is fiscally sound and invests taxpayer dollars wisely last year we delivered one of the largest tax cuts in state history as a result state income and business tax rates are the lowest since 1934 idahoans are enjoying bigger paychecks even though sales tax and corporate tax revenues have been robust our personal income tax receipts are falling short the federal tax code changed recently but few idahoans know they need to update their tax withholdings i am ordering the tax commission to do all they can to better inform taxpayers of what they need to do to avoid a surprise income tax bill my team is following this issue closely confident revenues will eventually match the rapid pace of economic growth though we are confident in true idaho fashion we will not spend money until it s in the bank my budget recommendation will balance our books and fulfill important promises i propose working together with you to set the stage next year using our budget surplus to eliminate the grocery tax once and for all additionally any new tax exemption should be tied to a proportional reduction in state spending or real income generation as a conservative i will utilize all other mechanisms to ensure our state remains fiscally sound over the long term it is prudent to live by the advice of speaker bedke s grandfather it won t be the bad years that put you out of business it s what you did in the good years that sets you up for failure or success as we review our state budget we must ask key questions is there too much spending on autopilot are we putting off maintenance that will cost our children more tomorrow do we have adequate rainy day funds how do we structure the surplus eliminator these measures and my proposed budget ensure we avoid the short term fiscal mistakes that other states and the federal government continue to make let s talk about my number one priority for our state budget education education policy requires long term planning and commitment these past four years with the hard work of stakeholders and many legislators in this room idaho has a successful record of responsible investment in education we have increased the budget for our schools by 32 percent this past year idaho teachers received one of the nation s largest year to year pay increases as governor i will continue our momentum and be an unrelenting advocate for educational excellence in our state to amplify the voices of those on the front lines of education i will create a children s cabinet to advise me throughout my term on a variety of education issues my children s cabinet will consist of traditional education stakeholders parents and groups across our state dedicated to advocating for children our task force on public education and its five year plan has been the envy of other states it has been the force behind an unprecedented sustained effort to improve idaho education my budget recommendation implements the fifth year of the task force recommendations this investment puts in place the next phase of increased teacher salaries i m also recommending an increase to the popular advanced opportunity program which saves idaho families in tuition costs and provides stepping stones for students wanting to go on to post secondary opportunities that best suit them now that we ve agreed on a new idaho reading indicator i want to boost our efforts for literacy my budget recommendation proposes that we double literacy program funding to 26 million the school districts will decide the best ways to use the funds to raise reading scores among their students they will choose from a variety of proven intervention methods such as full day kindergarten reading coaches and summer reading programs the variety of methods recognizes no one kid is the same and that boise may not have the solution for what works in bonners ferry or blackfoot our goal must be to ensure all kids begin at the same starting line in life by the third grade our students must learn to read so they can read to learn our state still has many challenges when it comes to recruiting teachers in addition to supporting the next phase of teacher salary increases my budget recommendation fulfills my promise to raise starting teacher pay to 40 000 a year as we reward our educators we expect school districts to continue working with us on reporting measurements that idahoans need to validate increased education investments we are proud of these efforts but there is still more to do drawing on the successful model we ve been using i invite you to join me in creating an initiative i m calling our kids idaho s future the charge of this broad based task force will be to look at our education system holistically and prioritize where we should invest the next available dollar this initiative will provide idaho s next five year blueprint for education investment and reform i will continue to focus on increasing idaho s go on rates and accomplishing our goal of having 60 percent of our 25 to 34 year olds with a completed degree or a professional certificate to do that we must expand career technical opportunities further my budget recommendation increases funding for opportunity scholarship applicants providing a market based approach to higher education funding with money following the students and allowing them to choose the institution and degree that best fits their needs in my work on economic development i know there s a strong correlation between our education system and the attractiveness of our state to entrepreneurs and businesses most importantly a strong education system helps ensure we keep our best and brightest here in idaho from the roads you drive to take your children to school to the hunting licenses you purchase like it or not the state has a monopoly on many services citizens cannot provide themselves with this role comes responsibility and accountability to idahoans as your governor i pledge to champion citizen confidence in state government i ve been frustrated with the major shortcomings in customer service at the division of motor vehicles the issues stem from contracting procedures i have asked my new director at the department of administration to identify critical lessons from the dmv situation and provide a thorough review of our state purchasing and contract administration processes idahoans deserve an action plan for better results from government state government has a duty to protect the data citizens entrust to us i chaired the cybersecurity task force three years ago and we have made progress on this important issue following these efforts my budget recommendation lays out a plan for it and cybersecurity modernization this effort will significantly reduce our cyber vulnerability and provide long term savings with the ultimate goals of protecting citizens data and building public confidence there are other areas where we must maintain the trust of idahoans on election day over 60 of voters approved medicaid expansion for months i made it clear i would honor the will of the people i intend to work with you to implement medicaid expansion using an idaho approach we need spring in our safety net so that there are multiple pathways for the gap population to move off medicaid and onto private coverage while making health care available to low income individuals we should also do what we can to make affordable accessible quality health care available to all idahoans an unintended outcome of the affordable care act is that too many people are priced out of health insurance coverage in the past two years the number of uninsured idahoans increased by 125 000 almost double the gap population as idaho continues to enjoy the fastest growing economy in the nation the number of insured idahoans should be increasing not decreasing we must pursue strategies that contain health care costs that s why i joined with governor otter last year in issuing an executive order on state based individual market health plans as governor i will continue these efforts these health care plans are comprehensive and provide our citizens more affordable choices the fact is we have a proven track record of delivering idaho solutions on health care when idaho opted for a state run health insurance exchange we created an idaho solution instead of adopting a federal one size fits all mandate your health idaho has since been recognized as one of the best exchanges in the country i intend to continue developing idaho solutions that bring health care costs down for all idahoans i have met with federal partners to pursue alternatives for affordable health care plans i will fight for state flexibility and state control to develop idaho solutions for idaho families public safety is one of the pillars of state government idahoans enjoy a high quality of life in part because we live in one of the safest states in the nation we must hold those who violate our laws accountable but we also must invest in changing their behavior so our communities will be safer once offenders pay their debt to society my budget recommendation takes on this challenge in a way that provides not only an increase in our prison capacity but also the resources needed to reduce the flow of inmates to our prisons this will be done by expanding the st anthony work camp in eastern idaho and opening a community reentry center in northern idaho in addition to providing timely relief to idaho s overcrowded prisons these combined 220 beds focus specifically on helping those in custody acquire critical skills to successfully transition back into society after release former offenders cannot be successful after reentry and on parole if we don t have the necessary bed space and programs such as drug courts to halt the revolving door help for substance abuse is often only available once a person becomes an offender there is a clear nexus between mental health and substance abuse we must intervene in these areas prior to individuals entering our criminal justice system communities across idaho face the scourge of opioid addiction and other substance abuse problems fortunately there is a solid foundation of work on this issue two years ago the idaho office of drug policy and the department of health and welfare convened a stakeholder group that put together a strategic five year action plan on tackling the issue of opioid addiction in idaho we know the challenge is larger than just opioid addiction many problems that begin with opioids evolve into heroin and fentanyl looking ahead i will issue an executive order on substance abuse formalizing this existing opioid plan broadening these efforts directing future resources and creating non offender programs for substance abuse this makes the most sense because treating addicts and those with mental health problems in prison is expensive and often too late as we seek ways to reduce health care costs and protect the public we also must make sure state government is reducing all unnecessary barriers to prosperity one barrier is the daunting financial reality facing first time homebuyers particularly young people just starting their careers and families one specific proposal i will champion to help more idahoans achieve the american dream is the first time home buyer savings account this account will encourage young families to set aside part of their pre tax income to make a down payment on their first home idaho is seeing unprecedented economic growth in many parts of the state however that growth has not been matched in all our communities in my travels i constantly hear how the absence of adequate broadband infrastructure is a deterrent to growth and economic development the idaho department of commerce spent the past year analyzing the statewide challenge of inadequate broadband to ensure idaho can adapt to the rapidly evolving digital world we must actively work to improve idaho s broadband access pursuing all options to increase broadband connectivity i will work with the legislature to ensure both rural and urban idaho are connected and well positioned to attract and create maximum success i am also committed to knocking down other barriers to independence and prosperity in may 2017 i issued the licensing freedom act executive order late last year i finalized a report that outlined the scope of occupational licensing in idaho and provided key recommendations working closely with the legislature i intend to fulfill all recommendations from the licensing freedom act reducing regulatory burdens and improving customer service while protecting the public my first executive order as governor will put in place two of those recommendations sunrise and sunset processes for future occupational licensing laws to reduce overall regulatory burdens on our citizens and businesses i will issue another executive order requiring state agencies to revoke two regulations for every new regulation they want to implement this commitment to cutting red tape will ensure we are governing with the lightest possible hand looking long term we must address transportation deficiencies i ask you to join me in looking at these long term needs specifically the safety of our roads and bridges and the necessary improvements to preserve our citizens most precious commodity their time it is critical that we provide the needed road capacity to get our people and products to their destinations in the most efficient manner all these efforts will help idaho remain a beacon for prosperity and opportunity in america agriculture remains the backbone of idaho s rural economy as is often the case agriculture is coping with the effects of significant challenges from commodity prices to transportation and trade as they have for generations progressive farmers and ranchers meet these challenges by increasing their production and efficiency idaho s wheat yield was up 15 percent and set a record this year the barley yield is up 10 percent from last year and alfalfa is up 19 percent idaho jumped oregon to become the number two hop producing state in the nation in the past 16 years idaho s dairy production has doubled idaho remains a heavily trade dependent state with around 2 billion in agricultural exports when markets are open agriculture makes the most of those opportunities when markets are disrupted we feel it the profitability of idaho agriculture and its ability to compete nationally and internationally is dependent upon the time and cost of getting our products to consumers i look forward to working with you to increase rail access address truck shortages and reduce the burdens of federal regulations you all know water is idaho s lifeblood and we ve made great strides in protecting it under the leadership of the water resource board we have doubled our goal of refilling and replenishing our critically important eastern snake plain aquifer adding more water this year than was removed while this is an impressive accomplishment this must be an ongoing effort regardless of the water year we must focus on expanding the water infrastructure across our state if water is idaho s lifeblood our public lands are surely one of our state s greatest assets idaho based collaboration is key to addressing the many issues facing public lands together we must responsibly manage and protect the special places that make idaho unique as governor i will work to expand access and tackle threats to our public lands this work will protect important industries for our economy from motorized recreation rafting skiing and hunting to hiking fishing and camping idaho s outdoor recreation industry generates billions in consumer spending each year and supports 78 000 jobs across the state iconic companies like smith optics buck knives clif bar vista outdoor and numerous guides and outfitters call our state home idaho s lands and waterways provide unparalleled outdoor recreation opportunities enhancing the quality of life for idahoans and attracting visitors which in turn power urban and rural economies across our state there are threats to our public lands that must be confronted wildfire is a part of living in the west several factors contribute to the increasing frequency of catastrophic wildfires these fires threaten public safety and pump millions of tons of pollutants into the air harming the health of our citizens they damage wildlife habitat and contaminate our pristine waters they disrupt our economy and cost taxpayers millions of dollars every year one of those threats is the buildup of fuels on our public lands closest to where we live work and play a few weeks ago i signed a first of its kind agreement between idaho and the u s department of agriculture this collaborative agreement will reduce wildfire risk improve forest health and enhance wildlife habitat by actively managing more acres of federal forests the new shared stewardship approach unifies land management activities that are now disjointed across federal state and privately owned tracts we ll use all the tools available to us to reduce fuels around communities including timber harvest prescribed burns and other activities we re already seeing a return on our investment in the good neighbor authority a program that utilizes state employees and contracting processes for restoration work on federal lands idaho is leading the country in our fresh collaborative approach to land management other states have already reached out to idaho for the shared stewardship blueprint we created with the feds in addition there are now over 300 ranchers and farmers who are members of nine rangeland fire protection associations across southern idaho the initial attack and intel they provide on more than 9 million acres of idaho s rangeland have given idaho significantly improved chances against the devastation of large wildfires the idaho national laboratory inl is one of our state s largest employers it is a national asset dedicated to our energy and security interests i have been impressed to see collaboration between the lab and our state s universities those enhanced ties will result in a more secure nation a thriving laboratory and strengthened university programs most importantly it presents opportunities for our state s best and brightest students to work and raise their families right here in idaho with that in mind i am pleased to announce that i am authorizing the continuation of the leadership in nuclear energy line commission the line commission will remain dedicated to advising us so we can promote the advancement of nuclear energy and ensure the vitality of the inl there is an incredible opportunity for idaho its businesses and its institutions of higher learning to lead our nation and the globe in pushing the new frontiers of safe clean nuclear energy development in addition to world class research idaho has one of the most affordable and sustainable energy supplies in america it s clean with a mix of hydroelectric wind and solar this energy mix and low cost make idaho competitive in attracting new industries i am intent on seizing this moment through the free market and the innovations at the inl idaho will continue to expand opportunities for clean and affordable energy for our citizens and the world idaho is ready to lead my friends if we create an environment that brings about economic prosperity if we continue to invest and modernize education if we do what we can to make healthcare accessible and affordable if we invest in our infrastructure if we protect our natural resources and if we assure citizen confidence in government we will keep our best and brightest here in idaho it is an honor to offer this state of the state to the interns pages young viewers and our children and grandchildren when they eventually occupy these seats here in the people s house if we do the job before us now i am confident they will thank us in the decades to come thank you and god bless idaho this story was originally published january 7 2019 1 42 pm
by philippe waechter chief economist ostrum asset management the economic climate has dramatically changed recently there are more uncertainties as international relations is no longer perceived as a cooperative process we ve seen during the last 10 years very different responses to the development of the crisis and very different behaviors on the political side people perceive risks in this new environment and adoptextremely conservative strategies this can be seen on the political side as has been the case with the united kingdom after the referendum on brexit with president donald trump in the united states and with the new italian government we ve observed deep changes in the global economic momentum and consequently political responses have been at odds with what we d thought before there are two types of changes one type of change is consistent with the business cycle the us federal reserve system s the fed s current strategy is of this kind since last april the tighter monetary policy seen in washington has created a deep change in the global economic equilibrium the dollar is perceived as a stronger currency leading to arbitrages on assets and at the advantage of assets in dollars the fragility seen in emerging countries this summer is a direct consequence of this new monetary policy strategy nevertheless this is the usual story between the united states and emerging countries when the fed changes its policy stance the fed s strategy puts an emphasis on the fact that the eurozone and the us are not at the same stage of the economic cycle therefore the european central bank ecb doesn t want to follow and will not follow the fed s strategy a rapid tightening would create a growth disaster in europe so then the ecb monetary policy is expected to remain stable until at least the end of summer 2019 by then the fed s interest rate will be much higher than it is today with negative consequences on the us growth momentum what would be the response of eurozone economic policy in case of a negative shock on us economic activity the difference of position in the business cycle that has come from the european commission ec and the ecb s austerity policies in 2011 and 2012 may then be very costly for the euro area the other type of change is related to the new geography of the economic activity the globalization process seen since the late 1990s has had a strong impact on the location of production notably in the manufacturing sector it was then perceived as an optimal allocation of resources even if in western countries it was at the expense of the development of their manufacturing sectors the optimistic perception we had in the recent past of the globalization process has changed now many people in developed countries think that the rapid improvement seen in emerging countries notably in asia and in china has had a negative impact on their own situations this is reflected in the famous elephant graph in branko milanovic s analysis he showed that improvement in revenues in china and india has been at the expense of less qualified workers in western countries this can be an explanation of the political shift mentioned above the complicated story is that now this situation in the manufacturing sector is not reversible in the short term the location of production in asia is there to stay this point is the source of president trump s commercial policy he has tried to reverse this situation even if at a very high long term cost for the us economy this clearly creates a non cooperative environment at the global level reversing the enthusiasm seen for globalization 15 years ago the rapid change in the location and in the momentum of production to perceive the new world into which we ve entered the best statistic at which to look is production in the manufacturing sector this sector is important in international trade but it is also a major source of productivity gains in a development process the industrial sector is always key as it allows large productivity gains and large increases in revenues this stage of development was a major source of improvement in developed countries in the post world war ii period the period of abundance seen in western countries is a consequence of this rapid increase in the industrial sector it s a necessary step to turn into a service economy which creates fewer productivity gains therefore it is important for each developed country to maintain a strong industrial sector to generate productivity gains that will improve the global performance of the economy in the last 10 years industrial development is no longer the privilege of western countries between the first half of 2008 before the great recession and the first half of 2018 the world industrial production index calculated by the dutch institution cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis has been up by 22 percent around 2 percent per year what is interesting is the decomposition strong contribution from asia but not western countries for the us the gain is just 2 6 percent or 0 25 percent per year for japan the industrial production level is 10 8 percent below 2008 and for the euro area it is 3 2 percent below in other words these three contributions to the world momentum have been weak during the last 10 years the global dynamism is not related to the three regions that created the three fabulous decades after wwii that s a huge change this is a real source of low productivity gains for western countries these figures also show that the rebound after the great recession has been limited even in the us ten years to recover is very long and the process of the manufacturing sector has changed even if the level has been stable there are new industries with high productivity gains but no more jobs contrary to the 1960s with an income distribution that went more to capital owners than to the rest of the population thomas piketty said that beautifully in his famous book the relative stability of western countries industrial production has been matched by a strong increase in asia excluding japan in this part of the world the level of production has almost doubled 98 percent circa 7 percent per year for other emerging regions the industrial production growth has been low between 0 6 percent per year on average in latin america to 1 percent in central europe it is not a surprise but the world barycenter has changed during the last decade to the advantage of china therefore this dynamic was perceived as a positive development during the phase of globalization but is now considered as a constraint in western countries the resources allocation has followed the geography of productive efficiency the production moved to asia because it was less expensive there than in developed countries and because western countries could create new services in which western countries are more efficient this is the application of ricardo s theory of comparative advantage this simple statistic shows that the source of growth momentum is now in asia more than elsewhere in the world of course the us and europe are still very strong but are no longer the nest of the global impulse the dynamic will not be reversed as the economic growth is much higher in asia than elsewhere companies have no interest in reversing their moves to asia this situation has many consequences the rapid development in china implies that many resources have been allocated to research and development therefore the innovation process is now a chinese process to many analysts large chinese companies alibaba wechat tencent are more efficient than amazon or facebook the plan made in china 2025 wants to increase this comparative advantage the belt and road initiative program is just a companion to this plan to distribute chinese products throughout the world with chinese rules these developments are a real challenge to the us the barycenter of the global equilibrium is moving to china this is the main reason for the new us trade policy it s just a way to limit the rapid change on the geography of growth and of innovation the main source of power in the us remains political this country is still more powerful than any other president trump has understood that and put an emphasis on politics to impose a positive economic environment for the us this strength is also a source of the strong dollar according to the french historian fernand braudel this change in the barycenter has always been a source of tensions and volatility the other historical point is that china which was the largest world economy before the 19th century has not been able to catch the industrial revolution that started in the uk and that has made the richness of western countries the current chinese momentum is a catch up effect of the last two centuries the change will be complete when china has the political power the past decade has been decisive china has created conditions to be the global leader in the future it still generates high productivity gains creating a strong comparative advantage the coming years will be a period of transition with tensions and volatility the world will remain global and western countries will have to innovate a lot to remain attractive this role of follower is a new one for them the us monetary policy and its impact on the global business cycle us monetary policy changed last spring the federal reserve perceived that the new white house fiscal policy was not sustainable in the long term and might create large imbalances that could harm the us economy the fed s chairman jerome jay powell s strategy has then been to rebalance the policy mix which is currently too accommodative for an economy at full employment then the fed will continue to tighten its monetary policy as long as it perceives that the trajectory of the us economy is not on a sustainable path there are two remarks to make the fed s perception of the inflation risk has dramatically changed during chair janet yellen s tenure the main target was growth as inflation was low there was no reason to tighten monetary policy because inthis environment higher interest rates would have created a risk on activity it was more efficient to act only after a surge in inflation not before now the situation has changed the fiscal policy is focused on feeding the domestic demand and this could imply higher inflation then the fed s role becomes limiting the risk of inflation in the near future and dampening inflation expectations that s why it will continue to tighten as the fed s credibility will allow low inflation expectations long term interest rates will not jump higher but remain close to the current level this means that the tighter monetary policy will lead to a flattening of the yield curve further leading to the risk of a serious slowdown of the us economy at the beginning of 2020 there will be a contagion effect of this negative shock throughout the world and notably in europe if the shock is strong and persistent then the ecb will not be able to change its monetary policy to cushion the us wave at the end of 2019 the ecb refinancing rate will be at 0 25 percent a drop of 25 basis points will not be sufficient the ecb will have to invent a new instrument as asset purchases as the current form will not work again because the amount of german debt will not be sufficient to satisfy the current rules purchases are proportional to countries share in the ecb capital as public debt remains high we cannot expect that the european commission or the german government will allow a large public deficit europe will pay the difference in the business cycle due to austerity policies the main risk for europe is at this moment economic growth will drop and converge rapidly below its potential while on the political side the period will be after the european elections with a high risk of more populism the world economy is changing rapidly and deeply converging to a non cooperative one that s a real source of concern for all and specifically for european citizens

liquidity tightening around the world 2019 was always going to be a stressful year but nobody expected it to start with a currency market flash crash that briefly pushed dollar yen below 105 00 the

growth are deepening and sending tremors through world markets dampening investors appetite for riskier assets and making it harder and more expensive for em issuers to roll over debt and borrow

december s policy meeting with indications that just two further quarter points may be expected in the year ahead while powell didn t explicitly rule out further hikes his comments that the fed will be listening carefully to markets and a reiteration of increased data dependence and that interest rates aren t on a pre set path alongside an acknowledgement of the risks posed by slowing global growth and concerns over the us china trade war left traders sceptical about future hikes chief fx strategist at scotiabank toronto shaun osborne commented fed chair powell s comments friday that

as we start a new year it s time to polish the crystal ball with our 13th annual predictions for the economy share and property for the 12 months ahead we also come clean on how our predictions from this time last year actually panned out in reality harsh but fair we reckon if you re going to put yourself on the line there has to be some accountability an old economist mate of ours always says if you re going to forecast do it often so you can keep changing your mind or forecast so far into the future that when you get there people have forgotten what you ve said the sections in italics are what we predicted this time last year for 2018 it s fair to say the only people who seemed to have made money last year was the government with its river of tax gold and tight spending economy economic growth around 3 per cent unemployment below 5 5 per cent aussie dollar to stay above us70 cents if there was an interest rate hike it would be at very end of the year our predictions for the australian economy were pretty right as we entered our record breaking 28th consecutive year of positive economic growth our economic performance was highlighted by the prestigious london based the economist financial magazine with a 15 page cover story titled aussie rules what the rest of the world can learn from australia overall 2018 was another strong year which has resulted in the federal budget coming into surplus much earlier than expected but 2019 looks a lot more uncertain unemployment in 2018 remained below 5 5 per cent the red hot us economy is under pressure from four interest rate hikes a potential trade war with china and erratic policy decisions from the trump administration some market analysts are factoring in the possibility of a us recession in the next 18 months the ripple effect of a slowing us economy and trade war will be significant to global growth and australia will not be immune but we re in good shape to fight any global headwinds and also the slowdown in our property market the federal budget is in good shape employment is strong and trade balance solid we d expect no change in official interest rates for 2019 if there is a change it is more likely to be a cut in rates if the economy gets bad from those global influences economic growth of around 3 per cent slightly less than other market predictions still looks achievable which would be helped by an australian dollar below us70 cents shares it s all about trump us tax cuts should underpin corporate profits happy consumers and rising share prices another solid year for australian sharemarkets what a horrible year for sharemarkets around the world the worst since the global financial crisis and yes indeed a lot of the reason was about trump volatility unnerved many of us we were alarmed by big sharemarket falls in february were relieved when markets bounced back strongly across the middle of the year and then shattered by the falls of the last three months president donald trump has been blamed as one of the reasons behind sharemarket falls across the major indices for the year america s broader based s p 500 was 6 2 per cent lower london s ft 100 was down 12 5 per cent and germany s dax closed 18 3 per cent lower locally the asx 200 was off 6 9 per cent in australian dollar terms but in us dollar terms that s how international investors measure us the index lost a hefty 15 93 per cent for the year while healthcare stocks had a good year our major banks took a battering from increased regulation and the consequences of the banking royal commission this year is going to be another tough one for the australian sharemarket any overall gains will be small and there is a good chance of further falls banking and resource stocks account for half the value of the asx200 the continuing local credit squeeze and tight global financial conditions will impact bank performance a weaker global economy and trade war will hurt commodity prices and resource stocks residential property we expect sydney residential property values to fall in 2018 melbourne property growth will slow considerably and on an annual basis be steady for the year darwin perth and adelaide will be flat and hobart will stay the standout market that old saying that bricks and mortar never go down was again shown to be a myth having said that it has always been about where you buy and at what stage in the property cycle the property market in many capital cities has taken a hit in recent months nationally property prices fell 4 8 per cent for the year the weakest market conditions since 2008 four of the eight capital cities recorded a decline in dwelling values over the year sydney fell 8 9 per cent melbourne 7 per cent perth 4 7 per cent and darwin 1 5 per cent the remaining capital cities recorded a weakening in the pace of growth hobart was the star performer but even it was slowing significantly at the end of the year it s more of the same in 2019 as a combination of tight lending conditions the back end of the construction boom and slowing immigration will continue to impact values led by sydney and melbourne there is the very real possibility that all major capital cities could record declines in 2019 or in a best case scenario hobart adelaide and canberra will be flat originally published as david and libby koch s new year predictions for aussie investors

you re going to forecast do it often so you can keep changing your mind or forecast so far into the future that when you get there people have forgotten what you ve said the sections in italics are what we predicted this time last year for 2018 it s fair to say the only people who seemed to have made money last year was the government with its river of tax gold and tight spending economy economic growth around 3 per cent unemployment below 5 5 per cent aussie dollar to stay above us70 cents if there was an interest rate hike it would be at very end of the year our predictions for the australian economy were pretty right as we entered our record breaking 28th consecutive year of positive economic growth our economic performance was highlighted by the prestigious london based the economist financial magazine with a 15 page cover story titled aussie rules what the rest of the world can learn from australia overall 2018 was another strong year which has resulted in the federal budget coming into surplus much earlier than expected but 2019 looks a lot more uncertain unemployment in 2018 remained below 5 5 per cent the red hot us economy is under pressure from four interest rate hikes a potential trade war with china and erratic policy decisions from the trump administration some market analysts are factoring in the possibility of a us recession in the next 18 months the ripple effect of a slowing us economy and trade war will be significant to global growth and australia will not be immune but we re in good shape to fight any global headwinds and also the slowdown in our property market the federal budget is in good shape employment is strong and trade balance solid we d expect no change in official interest rates for 2019 if there is a change it is more likely to be a cut in rates if the economy gets bad from those global influences economic growth of around 3 per cent slightly less than other market predictions still looks achievable which would be helped by

from stratfor heading into 2019 oil producers are getting the feeling that they ve seen this market before that suspicion was reinforced last month when the price of global benchmark brent crude briefly fell below 50 for the first time since june 2017 in addition for the second time in five years declining oil prices have forced global oil producers to stabilize the market by cutting production by 1 2 million barrels per day bpd and for the second time in those five years producers will have to deal with the consequences of low prices even if the pain might not be as bad this time around an oil market under pressure russia saudi arabia and other members of opec may have been victims of their own success in 2018 after cutting oil production to start 2017 resulting in the slow rise in prices during 2017 and 2018 the coalition of opec and non opec countries the so called opec decided in june 2017 to relax some production curbs but higher oil prices also spurred tight oil producers in north america the nemesis of opec to boost investment to accelerate production growth as a result u s production hit a record 11 5 million bpd in october 2018 a nearly 2 million bpd increase over the previous year high growth in u s production rising output from saudi arabia sanctions waivers for the purchase of iranian oil and a weak global economy due to the u s trade war prompted oil markets to begin a sell off while prices are likely to rise in part because of riyadh s decision to cut production again u s president donald trump had pressured saudi arabia to increase production before the iran sanctions took effect in november 2018 there is no escaping the simple truth the oil market remains oversupplied even with the cuts what s more u s output will likely provide all the growth if not more that is needed to satisfy the market in 2019 as a result prices could remain at current lows for much of the year with most estimates ranging from 40 to 75 per barrel the recent drop in prices resembles the fall seen in the second half of 2014 this time around however many oil producers won t have to make the same painstaking economic adjustments as they did in 2015 most have already implemented long term initiatives to alleviate the problems created by low prices so what precisely is in store for some of the world s most important producers saudi arabia unfazed crown prince mohammed bin salman responded to falling oil prices by promising to reduce subsidies and institute significant austerity measures in 2015 when the country s budget deficit peaked at 97 9 billion riyadh also launched the vision 2030 plan in april 2016 to increase the kingdom s revenue from non oil streams to boost the private sector and to diversify the economy away from a dependence on oil exports although riyadh has seen success with some vision 2030 goals non oil revenue rose from 115 billion riyals in 2014 to 287 billion riyals 76 5 billion in 2018 it has struggled to entice foreign investment and to jump start the private sector both goals lie at the heart of vision 2030 to pick up the slack riyadh has had to fall back on its long standing economic strategy make the necessary investments on its own or resort to its sovereign wealth fund the public investment fund to pay for domestic projects lower oil prices put the desert kingdom in a bind it cannot make the necessary adjustments to quickly stimulate the private sector or attract investment even though it must shore up its domestic economy since the crown prince remains under global pressure after the murder of dissident journalist jamal khashoggi saudi arabia s budget for 2019 aims to do the latter riyadh is planning not only to introduce its highest budget ever but also to boost capital spending by 20 percent meaning it needs an oil price of about 90 per barrel to break even but because the kingdom wishes to maintain its spending plans despite low oil prices riyadh will likely continue to rack up debt at a significant pace russia s many headaches like saudi arabia russia suffered some significant pain in 2014 and 2015 as prices declined moreover moscow opted to continue floating the ruble on international currency markets causing it to substantially weaken as oil prices fell for russia this decision has had contrasting ramifications while it did make imports more expensive and force the kremlin to rely more on borrowing and reserve withdrawals to plug budget holes it also boosted non oil exports since the weakened ruble made russian agriculture and industrial goods more competitive moscow also adopted a wise approach to rising oil prices by avoiding the temptation to implement an expansionary budget instead it took any oil revenue above 40 per barrel and deposited it in a rainy day fund or used it to reduce its deficit it has also pursued more comprehensive reform efforts at home increasing its value added tax from 18 percent to 20 percent for the 2019 budget and continuing austerity measures which led to a small budget surplus last year a lower oil price will certainly result in a budget deficit for russia but low prices are just one of many concerns for its economy washington continues to expand its sanctions against the kremlin in a number of fields even threatening measures against russian energy pipelines such as nord stream 2 which would jeopardize aspects of moscow s long term economic strategy for the past five years moscow has emphasized reducing its economic dependence on the west by expanding economic ties to asia but the move has ultimately provided russia with little succor due to the downturn in asian markets amid the u s china trade war iran s worst nightmare perhaps no country will feel the pinch from lower prices as much as iran the country s oil exports had already fallen by about 1 million bpd due to the u s decision to reintroduce sanctions after pulling out of the iranian nuclear deal but the low prices will only exacerbate the situation for the islamic republic the trump administration granted 180 day waivers to eight countries to let them continue importing iranian oil in part because of the october 2018 spike in oil prices but if the market remains oversupplied by the time the waivers come up for renewal in may washington will have more room to press tehran s customers to further reduce or eliminate those imports for iran the prospect that it will lose most of its buyers is even more worrying than the decline in the price of oil itself given that the knock on economic effects are causing serious political repercussions at home on dec 25 2018 president hassan rouhani presented the country s 2019 20 budget which envisions about 1 million to 1 5 million bpd of oil exports as well as a price of 50 to 54 per barrel but even if iran attains that level of exports it will suffer an economic recession due to the precipitous drop in oil exports and the increased cost of imports due to the rial s steep decline as well as u s efforts to limit the country s access to hard currency politically this will continue to weaken rouhani to the benefit of iran s conservatives and hard liners although the islamic republic will for the time being achieve the bare minimum avoiding an economic collapse iraq struggles to dole out its oil wealth iraq now the world s fourth largest oil producer faced two major challenges during the last price dip in 2014 not only did prices collapse sending baghdad into a financial tailspin but the islamic state also raced across western and northern iraq capturing key areas of production and while the militant group is no longer capable of holding urban centers like mosul it remains a terrorist threat what s more iraq can little afford the 88 billion price tag for the reconstruction of areas decimated by the islamic state so far it has only received 30 billion for the rebuilding effort after an international donor conference last year in kuwait yet most of those funds are in the form of credits and loans that baghdad must ultimately repay rising oil prices in 2018 allowed iraq to finally post a budget surplus thanks to conservative price assumptions and deeply unpopular austerity measures implemented by former prime minister haider al abadi a continuation of this would allow baghdad to use capital spending to help rebuild some of the damaged areas indeed the 2019 budget envisions a one third increase in capital expenditures but lower oil prices have put those plans in jeopardy prime minister adel abdul mahdi has failed to form a cabinet as political infighting between rival shiite factions has prevented him from filling the critical posts of defense minister and interior minister at the same time iraq s sectarian and ethnic composition will also tax its limited ability to rebuild the country and extend services to all citizens most of the areas destroyed by the islamic state are predominantly kurdish and sunni but abdul mahdi will be reluctant to allocate a lot of money to such reconstruction projects because residents of the country s oil capital the southern shiite city of basra have made strident demands for more jobs more public services and better access to water in the end iraq is likely to witness protests throughout 2019 as the country s leaders struggle to meet competing demands amid the decline in oil prices venezuela s slow burning crisis in venezuela the collapse of oil prices threw the country into a deep economic spiral that will fundamentally alter its economic activities for decades after prices plunged in 2014 caracas chose to fund its gaping deficit by expanding its monetary base fanning hyperinflation the government slashed imports and defaulted or fell behind on virtually all foreign debt payments even those to crucial creditors such as china and russia now caracas is slowly moving away from decades of relying on oil production for virtually all of its export income it s doing so out of necessity rather than choice with the decline in oil revenue the government of president nicolas maduro is looking for additional sources of funding to keep its political coalition intact with payouts and benefits oil production has declined by nearly 1 million bpd since the start of 2018 and other sources of revenue such as illicit mining will provide far less income than crude oil exports this will drive greater competition between venezuelan elites for revenue from illicit mining and other illegal activities such as cocaine trafficking in the long run this instability will likely claim the maduro government and even persist into a new opposition led administration a u s of winners and losers for most of the developed world cheap oil is a good thing after all the european union japan china and south korea are all significant net oil importers and despite rising oil production at home the united states also remains a large importer for now more importantly much of the u s economy consumes large amounts of oil meaning low prices are a boon at the same time weaker prices also indicate a relatively sluggish global outlook which hinders u s commercial activity worldwide lower prices in 2015 and 2016 halted north american growth in the production of tight oil the present drop in oil prices could now lead companies that had been making investment plans when prices exceeded 70 per barrel to curtail those proposals already several shale producers have canceled drilling rig additions in 2019 but many producers took out hedges when prices were high and production break even costs in some of the most productive u s shale plays in the permian basin are 45 to 50 per barrel this means that while the oil patch could suffer some financial pain if prices remain low it may not be enough to shut or reduce production overall no guarantees three months ago 90 per barrel of oil was not out of the question as brent spiked at 85 per barrel prices could quickly rise if there are changes in market conditions such as the health of the global economy but they could also remain low if conditions worsen or the u s china trade war deepens the opec countries most concerned about oil prices have decided to do whatever it takes to balance the market including further cuts beyond the reduction they implemented on jan 1 even if this does increase prices opec will likely find itself in a similar position to what happened in 2017 and 2018 when prices rose higher prices stimulate more production growth in north america obliging producers to make cuts permanent or deeper to offset strong growth elsewhere oil producers may be in for the rude awakening as 50 to 60 per barrel becomes the new normal and anything outside that range will likely be a temporary blip and whatever the new normal turns out to be most countries now have little choice but to shape their economic and financial strategies with that 50 60 range in mind

fact that her ideas were given any space at all space isn t shocking enough for you you should check out the ideas themselves they are a departure from the last 40 years of the way we think of how national budgets and american taxation should work and they are desperately needed at the moment ocasio cortez discussed two ideas specifically that would make your generic center right fiscal responsibility issue voter s hair stand on end advertisement a 70 tax rate on incomes above 10 million the application of modern monetary theory mmt on our budget according to this theory deficits are okay as long as money is being spent productively on say healthcare or infrastructure the only real danger with running deficits is out of control inflation which the federal reserve can control by raising rates obviously this flies in the face of everything your dad told you about being a prudent american the rich aren t supposed to be punished for their success with taxation and the government is supposed to give money back to people instead of wasting it as for deficits well those will turn america into weimar germany or so it goes ocasio cortez is here to tell you all of that we tried that line of thinking and the result was massive inequality and a hampered government it was just a useful idea that turned into a fever induced by special interest groups bent on minimizing money spent on social programs lowering taxes for the rich they found their foothold in the reagan administration and they ve been dominating american economic thought ever since so much so that the popular imagination almost forgot that these are just theories and started accepting them as mathematical fact but they re not advertisement quickly a word from economist john maynard keynes the ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by little else practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually slaves of some defunct economist read more the truth about alexandria ocasio cortez the inside story of how in just one year sandy the bartender became a lawmaker who triggers both parties strong and wrong in spanish there is a saying the dog that barks loudest eats and so it often is in politics since the 1970s the loudest voices in economics have come from the right from followers of economist milton friedman who believed that selfishness was the natural state of humanity you see why he would want a small federal budget and low taxes advertisement a bunch of friedman s disciples made their way into the reagan administration and there they started to craft pop culture economics as we know it today for example economist arthur laffer went in there and pitched what we know today as the laffer curve it contends that lower tax rates can actually lead to higher tax revenue something that certainly didn t happen when taxes were lowered last year as 2017 tax receipts came in lower than expected but you can still see laffer on cnn waxing philosophical about economics he was an advisor to the trump administration and to former kansas governor sam brownback who enacted the massive tax cuts that eventually laid waste to the state s economy deficit hawks on the right bark loud too even though they ve almost never practiced what they preach president ronald reagan used deficit spending to fund star wars and end the cold war the economy slowed after george bush sr raised taxes and then we were fine related stories former house speaker paul ryan a supposed deficit hawk and budget wunderkind exploded the deficit by passing 2017 s tax cut and nothing happened advertisement president george w bush exploded the budget after finding it in good shape and all was well in fact the major economic problems of bush s time in office came from the private sector from the irrational exuberance that led to the tech bubble and a mortgage crisis that ballooned into a full on global financial meltdown in the latter instance the government helped nudge us into the crisis melding a desire to encourage homeownership with an ideological bent toward deregulation read more now do you finally believe baby boomers are the most selfish generation united states of amnesia politics nerds talk about something called the overton window it s the theory that only a limited number of policy ideas can be discussed at a time it s a spectrum and only that which fits within the spectrum can make it into the national conversation advertisement it seems that ocasio cortez is getting her ideas on the spectrum that is why low tax zealots like grover norquist the infamous president of americans for tax reform are calling ocasio cortez proposal a war on tax payers never mind that reasonable economists admit that a 70 tax on income over 10 million wouldn t raise much revenue or impact many americans or hurt the economy at all as noah smith over at bloomberg writes economists have theorized that the optimal top tax rate for incomes higher than 300 000 a much lower cutoff than the one proposed by ocasio cortez should be about 73 percent more from smith advertisement so ocasio cortez s tax plan isn t radical at all a dramatic expansion of federal tax revenue would require much more than what ocasio cortez is proposing it would require an overhaul of the corporate and capital gains tax systems higher rates on a much broader range of high earners and probably wealth taxes as well it would require a huge amount of political will and a sustained policy making effort over a number of years so why are men like norquist howling over this proposal because they know what ocasio cortez is doing they did it themselves slowly inject an idea into the policy discussion and then push and push and push until it seems normal no matter how radical or ridiculous it may seem i mean these guys convinced us that if the government collected less tax revenue it would somehow end up with more tax revenue how illogical is that read more the white house just made one thing abundantly clear to millennials advertisement perhaps ocasio cortez s proposed tax rate wouldn t do much for the government s coffers but consider what it would do to the american imagination we live in a country where 63 of citizens think that our economy is stilted unfairly toward the rich and special interest groups according to pew research part of that is because of what the loudest voices have said our government should and should not spend money on because what their values are previous administrations have used deficit spending to fund wars iraq afghanistan and tax cuts aoc would have us used deficit spending to fund education healthcare and her green new deal these are things that we ve heard that we can t afford for our entire lives we ve heard that money in the government s hands is wasted but how could money that pays for the health and welfare of a country s own people be a waste it s not like it s going anywhere in an economy run on consumer spending anything that lets americans keep more of their paychecks instead of giving it to say health insurance companies that just buy back their own stock seems like it would juice the economy not hurt it advertisement as more and more americans feel the deck is stacked against them they re going to start listening to these ideas they know what has happened to them that suddenly taking care of a middle class family is harder and more expensive than it was for their parents but what ocasio cortez is offering is another reason why and another how we can fix it these whys and hows are terrifying the republicans who run the right thus their massive pile on everything ocasio cortez does it was easy to tell americans to keep taxes low when it seemed that anyone who worked hard enough could get ahead but what if no matter how hard you work the system is stacked against you it s looking increasingly clear that not everyone can make it to the top bracket or even move up brackets americans are starting to understand the meaning of privilege the privilege of being able to support a family or even just a person on minimum wage the privilege of being able to get an education if you have the brains but not the cash the privilege of being able to get sick without going broke and they re starting to understand it because slowly over the last few decades those privileges have been taken away from them perhaps that not ocasio cortez is what has broken our decades long policy fever she s just here to suggest another remedy

cities could record declines in 2019 or in a best case scenario hobart adelaide and canberra will be flat originally published as david and libby koch s new year predictions for aussie investors

here to learn about these picks stock advisor returns as of november 14 2018 for the second quarter we generated solid top line sales of 1 360 000 000 reflecting an organic increase of 3 and acquisition growth of 2 6 over last year s second quarter current quarter sales also include the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 2 growth was fairly well balanced between our organic initiatives and acquisitions while foreign currency translation obviously reduced sales organic sales growth was evenly spread across our three operating segments which demonstrates the value in our approach to deliberately maintaining a strategic balance between our segments and a focus on growth as we pursue our 2020 map to growth initiative near record wet fall weather resulted in disappointing sales at tremco roofing dryvit and various consumer segment products with exterior use we believe this weather related impact is temporary from a geographic standpoint we experienced disappointing international results across most all of our business particularly in europe which was also aggravated by the unfavorable foreign exchange our gross profit margin was impacted by raw material cost in the quarter once again as mentioned last quarter our businesses have been instituting price increases to combat the pressure put on margins by raw material cost increases which have been rising now for six consecutive quarters we anticipate that raw material cost will level off in the back half of our fiscal year and that our businesses will further close the gap on our margins with price increases that have been negotiated and will be instituted in the coming months we continue to reign in expenses during the quarter better cost control led to an adjusted sg a to sales ratio improvement of 100 basis points over the second quarter last year on an adjusted basis regarding our map to growth operating improvement plan we continue to make good progress this quarter we announced five additional manufacturing plant closures and eliminated another 149 positions we began the transition to center led manufacturing and procurement and we re moving forward on our supply chain initiatives where we re starting to consolidate the number of vendors and negotiating more favorable terms and pricing during the first half of our 2019 fiscal year cash from operations improved by 29 a direct result of improved working capital management while our bottom line results were disappointing we re pleased with our solid top line growth the anticipated margin improvement to come from our improving raw material cost to price ratio and the benefits we expect to experience as we continue to implement our map to growth initiative i d now like to turn the call over to kristine schulze rpm s senior director of financial reporting kristine schulze senior director of financial reporting thanks frank and good morning everyone during our fiscal 2019 second quarter we reported restructuring and other one time charges totaling 29 2 million as further detailed in our earnings release the largest component of these adjustments or nearly 23 million relates to our map to growth initiative of these map to growth charges nearly 7 million is related to severance 6 million resulted from restructuring related professional fees and erp consolidation expenses and the remaining amount is associated with our manufacturing consolidation initiative i will now review results of operations for our fiscal 2019 second quarter on an as adjusted basis during the second quarter our sales were a record 1 36 billion up 47 1 million which was a solid 3 6 increase over last year s second quarter organic sales grew 3 and acquisitions added 2 6 which was offset by foreign currency translation of 2 our earnings were impacted by several factors which included continued raw material cost challenges investment losses resulting from a new accounting standard and the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of the strengthening u s dollar as we anticipated on last quarter s call raw material headwinds persisted in the second quarter in particular we continued to experience significant challenges with the cost of silicones asphalt epoxy and acrylic resins while cans and other packaging continued to rise modestly however we continued to successfully institute price increases and were able to narrow the gap on our margins we also noted that an unfavorable product mix and higher inbound freight contributed to the slide in our margins sales in our industrial segment increased 2 1 to 718 million reflecting organic growth of 3 3 and acquisitions contributed an additional 1 5 foreign currency translation reduced sales by 2 7 the segment benefited from solid performance in our businesses providing corrosion control coatings north american construction sealants and concrete admixture and repair products this was achieved despite the impact of the second wettest autumn on record in the u s which affected sales particularly in our commercial roofing business international sales which account for approximately half of our industrial segment business were soft this quarter on the bottom line higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange impacted results we made good progress on our operating improvement initiatives in the segment which included progress toward consolidating production with the announced closure of three plants adjusted ebit in the segment increased 1 to 70 9 million from last year s second quarter in our consumer segment sales increased by 4 1 which was fairly evenly split between organic sales growth of 2 8 and acquisition growth of 2 9 foreign currency translation reduced sales by 1 6 organic sales growth was aided by new account penetration which offset poor pos performance resulting from exceptionally wet weather in the united states the segment s largest market adjusted ebit was 42 9 million price increases instituted late in the first quarter helped to slow margin erosion in the consumer segment however raw material cost continued to be a challenge operational improvements which began during the fourth quarter of last year continued to be made in the segment and are leading to working capital improvements also we announced the closure of one additional manufacturing facility during the second quarter specialty segment sales grew at a strong 7 6 pace this was driven by acquisition growth of 6 1 primarily from the september acquisition of nudura a manufacturer of insulated concrete forms that extends our private product line offerings organic growth contributed 2 3 to sales while foreign currency translations had a modestly unfavorable impact of 0 8 driving organic growth were our businesses providing wood coatings powdered coatings and florescent colorants specialty results were better than expected since the prior year comparison was a tough one performance by our restoration equipment business was brisk as it responded to recent natural disasters but was below elevated sales levels that resulted from hurricane harvey last year we made map to growth progress in this segment as well with the announced closure of one manufacturing facility adjusted ebit was 34 1 million during this year s second quarter during the quarter our stock performance enabled us to redeem our 2 25 convertible senior notes due 2020 which was completed on november 27 2018 by utilizing mostly cash for the redemption going forward this will have the impact of reducing our diluted share count by 3 3 million shares while being debt neutral to rpm on a related note we repurchased approximately 82 million of our common stock through november 30 2018 which is in line with our plan to return 1 5 billion in capital to our stockholders by may 31 2021 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases i ll now turn the call over to rusty for some details on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2019 rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer thanks kristine we remain focused on executing our map to growth operating improvement plan targeting a 540 basis point improvement in our operating margin as we announced on november 28 2018 we intend to return 1 5 billion in capital to our stockholders by may 31 2021 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in addition to the previously mentioned convertible bond redemption we have repurchased approximately 82 million of our common stock through november 30 2018 additional actions we completed during our fiscal 2019 second quarter includes the announced closure of five manufacturing plants the reduction of 149 positions and the start of our transition to center led manufacturing and procurement functions we also began to implement tactics to improve our manufacturing processes optimize assets and reduce inventory while moving forward on our supply chain initiatives to consolidate the number of vendors used and negotiate more favorable pricing and payment terms accordingly we are maintaining the long term projections that we provided at our november 28 investor day in regards to our sales outlook for fiscal 2019 we expect full year fiscal 2019 industrial segment sales to grow in the mid single digit range as it benefits from steady commercial construction activity and a recovery in the oil and gas market in our consumer segment we anticipate sales growth in the mid to upper single digit range resulting from recent market share gains and stepped up advertising to support new product placements in our specialty segment we expect sales growth in the low single digit range we have additional price increases negotiated recently which are scheduled to be implemented in february and march as we look forward this year i will now comment on our expectations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 from an operating perspective revenue growth should remain in the low to mid single digit range with fx headwinds remaining a challenge while we are seeing the early benefits of our purchasing activities and softness in certain raw material categories it is important to note that rpm is on a fifo basis for inventory which means that the benefits we are beginning to see on the raw material front will typically flow into our income statement 90 days later than if we were under the lifo method of accounting as is the case with our larger industry competitors due to three non operating items we anticipate significantly lower reported earnings and earnings per share for the third quarter period ended february 28 2019 these items are the following no 1 an anticipated current tax rate of approximately 26 versus a benefit from certain tax items of 5 9 million last year no 2 while gains were realized in the prior year on sales of marketable securities we expect a different result this year due to the combination of declines in the equities market in december and the new accounting standard which requires unrealized gains and losses on equity securities to now be reflected in earnings we anticipate a year over year negative impact during this year s third quarter to be in the range of 5 million to 6 million and no 3 an adverse comparison to last year s third quarter when we reversed approximately 3 4 million of long term incentive compensation when it became clear that the targeted goals would not be reached taken together expectations of continuing raw material cost challenges and these non operating items are likely to result in third quarter eps in the range of 0 10 or 0 12 per share although we are in the early innings of our restructuring efforts we are making good progress which has us excited about the prospects for the future as we work through the plan over the next few quarters we will continue to adjust out associated charges to provide a clear picture of the initiative and the progress we are making with that i ll turn the call back over to frank frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you rusty i d like to do a brief review of our 2020 map to growth initiative starting with our 2020 map to growth time line the program was kicked off in the spring of 2018 in june of 2018 we reached a settlement agreement with elliott management we added two new directors we formed an operating improvement committee which met three times over the summer to assess the opportunity and program design a full report was made to the rpm board in early october and we communicated our 2020 map to growth initiative to our global leadership team in early november and then obviously had an investor communication on november 28 what have we accomplished from a manufacturing perspective including two plant closures in the second quarter of last year five announced plant closures in the first quarter an additional five announced plant closures in the second quarter of fiscal 19 we have announced and are in the process of completing the closure on 12 manufacturing plants this is also driving the closure of nine warehouses and nine related offices from a procurement perspective as of today we have had meetings with vendors who represent approximately 400 million of what we believe is 1 5 billion of an addressable spend to discuss pricing and terms by the end of february we expect to have met with or addressed from an in sourcing or strategic perspective approximately 1 billion of our addressable spend i d like to make a comment on the second quarter raw material costs with some specifics our top 10 raw materials second quarter of this fiscal year to the second quarter of the prior year were up 10 i m sorry 18 a couple of these specifics include silicones which year over year are up 61 and epoxy resins which are up 31 the second quarter sequentially versus the first quarter we see our top 10 materials down 1 without addressing any additional specifics the point is we have more timely and better data across purchasing categories and manufacturing cost and more hands than we ve ever had and that s also a direct result of the improvements of our operating initiatives with those comments we would now be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator ok thank you sir and from bank of america we have steve byrne please go ahead frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning steve steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i just wanted to see whether or not your projected cost savings from your map to growth program are going to be adequate to hit that 16 ebit margin target given it seems like you re in a little bit of a deeper hole in your margin right now is that is it still on track to hit that 16 margin by the end of fiscal 2021 frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer sure as rusty commented i think we feel pretty good about our longer term targets in the map to growth program and also as he mentioned we expect starting with our april call we d actually be able to provide some more detail we want to be able to do a rearview mirror lookback that provides detail for instance on manufacturing in sites once those have actually been completed it s the right way to do to keep our people focused on execution and also the right way to handle communication flow we ll be in a position to do the same thing in other categories and so far we re on track in every category that we re focusing on steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst just one high level question for you frank on this map to growth initiative your investor event down in baltimore was certainly useful at drilling into all of your businesses but one comment i have is that every one of them seems to be headquartered in a different city i just wanted to hear your views on the potential merits of integration that includes the commercial infrastructure and the all of the back office headquarters of all these businesses is that on the table as well frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer so as it relates to our structure from a sales and marketing perspective as we commented we re big believers in the entrepreneurial approach that s been successful for rpm i think the organic growth that we re generating in this quarter and this year is reflective of that and we do not see any benefit long term of consolidating sales force or marketing or product development activities on the flip side we are keenly focused on consolidating much of the g a and accounting and erp systems into the four groups that we ve outlined on november 28 and we re making good progress on that we ll have more details on that again in april i can tell you that we have been working with our internal team in terms of some new hires and some promotions and with alixpartners on the manufacturing and operations perspective and we are very much on target we re very happy with the progress there on the g a side we didn t seem to have the same enthusiasm in terms of the outside resources so we have talked to a number of other firms and we have engaged an additional firm to help us with the combination of consolidation in the g a area and also opportunities for outsourcing so we re continuing to advance the ball both on the original program and in ways that we can accelerate or enhance it steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator from bmo capital markets we have john mcnulty please go ahead frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yes good morning thanks for taking my question hey frank at the investor day you spoke on procurement and raw material saves and i think one of the baskets was just the commodity cycle recovering and essentially catching up to the raw materials whether the raws fell or the pricing went through and if i remember the basket was somewhere in the 65 million to 80 million range i guess it looked like that was scheduled for kind of a wave two wave three which was 2021 2022 but we ve seen commodity prices fall pretty dramatically here so i guess the question is if you kind of look at what your commodities are looking like right now in terms of raw materials how much of that do you think you may see a couple years earlier than originally expected frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer so the map to growth initiative highlighted approximately 75 million to 80 million of savings that we believe we can get from a different approach to procurement over wave one and wave two which is really between now and the end of may 31 2020 and there was a 65 million number which we highlighted as commodity cycle recovery and we re pretty agnostic as to how much it would be ultimately and when it would hit i guess what i would say to that is just to refer back to the comments i made a minute ago year over year we re still getting hit pretty significantly second quarter top 10 materials were up 18 i highlighted a couple of the extreme examples sequentially the top 10 materials are down 1 that s not going to as rusty highlighted in his outlook we re still going to be facing a year over year significant raw material increase relative to the third quarter last year and the third quarter we expect this year we are seeing some softening in certain categories there are still some other categories that are going up and the underlying dynamics whether it s oil prices or propylene or other things are certainly moving in the right direction does suggest the commodity cycle improvements certainly should be coming before what we had as wave three so we ought to benefit from those with the entire industry we re also working internally on data to be able to track the difference between the structural procurement benefit changes and what would be coming in relationship to commodity cycle improvements anyways john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it and then on the industrial side i know there is it s a seasonally light quarter for you in terms of what you re in right now but i guess can you give us an update as to what you may be seeing there and i know you had indicated i guess on the guidance for the full year in sales that one of the areas where there was some hope was on the energy markets and i guess with that market coming under some pressure i guess i m wondering what kind of demand trends you re seeing there if there s been any change at all frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes i think the biggest disappointment in our industrial business was weather related our tremco roofing business which has been very strong dryvit which is again all exterior cladding both had weak second quarter results a lot of that was weather related in terms of a very wet fall i think weather also negatively impacted as i said the kind of exterior related products of our consumer segment we think that s temporary the more challenging area for us in terms of revenue disappointment was international in particular europe which seems to be slowing down and i m not too sure that that is temporary but when you put all that together we had real solid organic growth in a lot of our construction categories in corrosion control coatings and floor coatings which obviously exceeded the industrial segment average based on the challenges that we saw weather in some categories and some international weakness we feel pretty good about that and we feel pretty good about the progress we re making between raw material cost increases and price as the subsequent quarters are executed john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great and then just one last question just on the home depot rollout i guess can you give us an update as to how that s progressing again i know it s a seasonally relatively weak period but be curious how that s moving along frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer sure consumer takeaway across most of the categories we re in has been relatively flat all year i think there s a lot of belief that some of that s been weather related we continue to pick up some market share in the interior wood stains and finishes category we are exceeding our expectations we re exceeding our customers expectations and in a couple regions we re well ahead of the brand that we replaced so that program is off to a great start as it relates to pricing across all of our categories as folks on the call know we had some major line reviews and some new category pickups all of which came with some price commitments that precluded us from pursuing appropriate price increases in certain categories until those line review wins or new category pickups were annualized that will happen this spring and those negotiations are under way john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from great lakes review we have jason rodgers please go ahead jason rodgers great lakes review analyst yes would you be able to quantify the price increase benefit you experienced in the quarter and the expectation going forward frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer 2 about 2 on the quarter and i think you ll see the same and a little bit growing in the coming quarters jason rodgers great lakes review analyst and i was interested in your progress with the erp consolidation and perhaps you can discuss the time line for implementation there frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes i don t think we ll have that completed until the end of our map to growth program so you re looking december of 2020 or even into the spring of 2021 so by the end of our 21 fiscal year we re making solid steady progress we chose the path we did because we did have four core systems that where we are consolidating to the people are very comfortable with those so in our construction products categories sap in consumer sap and then microsoft d 365 in specialty and baan ln in our performance coatings group so it s really slow progress i think the tailors will be smaller international operations by the end of december 2020 with what will represent somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 90 of our revenues jason rodgers great lakes review analyst all right that s very helpful and it might be too early to ask this but wondered if you were getting any early feedback on the daily performance standards you re implementing at the plants frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer absolutely we are aside from the plant closures that i talked about we are instituting the operating improvement and continuous improvement program across our plants in the second quarter we had three what we call fit events which are focused manufacturing events we are instituting metrics that are consistent across our businesses we are measuring month by month the performance to those metrics we will be in the next 12 of our largest plants in the current quarter we are marching through our plants and we are measuring and we are seeing progress that makes us comfortable that we will meet or exceed the operating improvement targets that we laid out on november 28 both as it relates to consolidation and as it relates to plant floor improvement the last thing i d mention is that one of the real benefits of what we re doing is we have access to data on the procurement side and the plant side in more leadership hands it s more timely and more accurate than we ve ever had and that s incredibly helpful jason rodgers great lakes review analyst all right if i could just squeeze in a numbers question if you have an estimate for capex for fiscal 19 as well as a targeted amount of share repurchase for fiscal 19 frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer so i think for fiscal 19 we ll be flat to slightly up over last year in terms of share repurchases i d be hesitant to put out a target but we certainly were a repurchase of our stock in the mid to low 60s and i would expect us to be a repurchase of our stock where it is today and we are much committed to the return of capital targets that we put forth in november 28 jason rodgers great lakes review analyst all right thanks very much frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from gabelli company we have rosemarie morbelli please go ahead rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you good morning everyone frank i was wondering if as you are going through your map project if you are seeing some kind of disruption on your operations which would result or have resulted in slower growth than you anticipated outside of the weather impact i m assuming that it has to be disruptive frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes i m not aware that we re seeing disruption on the sales front i think there s a couple areas where we re doing some reorganization for instance in europe where we got some work to do and some opportunities that were perhaps bigger than we realized so we ve had some leadership changes in certain areas and that can certainly be disruptive we re moving to get the right leaders in the right places so that we can be properly focused but in general i think the enthusiasm for this program is across rpm and we re continuing to see pretty solid revenue growth rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst you are feeling most of the impact and what are you doing to offset it any new steps versus those you have expressed on november 28 frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer i think the slowdown in europe is pretty universal we re seeing it across most all of our business categories so unlike what we feel is some weather related impact on revenues in the second quarter in the u s is temporary i would expect us to see relatively flat growth in europe for the balance of the year and beyond that again i think we ll be in a position as we get things executed and realize to talk in hindsight in more detail but we have a pretty intense focus in a number of areas including europe in terms of some g a consolidation and also the manufacturing and operations work that is happening across rpm rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst and if i may ask one last one as raw material costs are coming down do you think that you can still achieve your price increases frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer raw material prices are coming down as i said 1 in the second quarter versus the first quarter they re up 18 year over year and in certain categories like silicone which is a critical component for instance for our dap business consumer diy in our tremco business those raw materials are up 61 they are not softening there continues to be some capacity issues there so the raw material situation today is a real mixed bag there are some improvement in some packaging areas but in other packaging areas particularly related to steel and or rigid packaging you re continuing to see some price issues so it s a mixed bag of volatility and it really is category by category and so there are a number of areas and silicone is a key one where we had been dealing with multiple price increases across a 12 month period and we re continuing to try and manage that rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst ok thank you operator and we have frank mitsch on the line please go ahead frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning frank mitsch fermium research llc analyst hey good morning frank and first off congratulations on finding a franchise qb frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes thank you very much we re happy bronx fans in cleveland ohio frank mitsch fermium research llc analyst absolutely absolutely sorry frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer i m just going to say we welcome you to come visit again next year frank mitsch fermium research llc analyst i will definitely look at the schedule hey obviously the november 28 investor day i thought went very well and you guys laid out a pretty good map to growth it happened late in the quarter during late in the fiscal second quarter and obviously a bit of an earnings miss here i was wondering was there anything that happened late in the quarter or after the quarter closed that may have negatively impacted the results such that you guys came in lighter than where consensus was frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer no i ll tell you two things that i think one was a mistake in our part and the other was something that we didn t anticipate and maybe should have the mistake in our part was when we re looking at the volatility of this year relative to all of the changes that were coming and all of the related charges we decided not to provide guidance and in hindsight the second quarter consensus was up 17 or 18 and that s not it hasn t been in the cards for us or anyone else and it was not part of our internal plan the reason we decided to provide specific guidance for the third quarter was that very reason again i think that simple math would suggest that there was going to be a 10 million or 12 million turnaround in tax expense year over year and so a couple other items like that the second item was the accounting change in now a requirement that if you have a marketable securities portfolio apparently much like banks you have to mark to market every quarter the equity portion of that and it was a nonevent in the first quarter for us i think it was a 1 million pre tax gain 100 of the shortfall eps wise from last year to this year could be attributed to what was almost a 10 million reversal where we had 3 5 million of gains last year this is in our captive insurance portfolios and this year i think we took a 6 or so million hit and that will be a challenge that we communicate better in the third quarter it is a non operating item we went through this in 08 and 09 and had six quarters of impairments and then as most of you would know by the end of 12 or 13 we had recovered more than had been written off in impairments in terms of the market recovery just to give some color on that our captive insurance companies had been a very smart way for us to manage certain levels of insurance our total portfolio it s about 130 million 93 million of that is equity this mark to market has a component to what that is historically you would only record realized gains or losses in this case you mark to market but if it s actually not a realized gain or loss there s no tax consequences and so we ll hide that off and explain that and separate that from our market issues that item alone is the eps reason why we re below last year and so hopefully that answers your question i think it was in hindsight for a couple of reasons maybe a mistake not to provide guidance we certainly would ve guided people differently in the second quarter and i think looking at us looking at our peers i think that makes sense with the numbers out in the third quarter and the progress that we re making in our map to growth initiative we re making good progress and we actually feel good about what s coming and there s nothing that s happened in the second quarter or will happen in the third quarter that makes us change our projections as outlined in november 28 frank mitsch fermium research llc analyst that s extremely helpful and there was a lot of commentary regarding the negative weather impact and you d indicated that you thought that was kind of a temporary sort of impact so should we be thinking about kind of a recovery in that regard as a fiscal fourth quarter event when the spring comes around and we make up for some pent up demand is that how you re thing about that frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer there s a couple areas of possible upside if you will we ve been dealing with weather issues in our consumer segment for most of last year it s not been unique to us it s not been a very good painting year i suspect that the wet fall will highlight that for other folks in the exterior painting categories i think there s pent up demand in a lot of the consumer businesses and so if we have a reasonable spring you ll see that i think there s continued strong growth potential in the tremco roofing restoration coatings we ve got a good backlog there so it d be nice to see that upside time will tell but there s every indication in terms of our construction products our roofing products the dryvit systems and a lot of our consumer products that some of the negative impacts have been weather related and temporary frank mitsch fermium research llc analyst very helpful thanks so much frank frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from baird we have ghansham panjabi please go ahead frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst hi everyone good morning happy new year to you frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer happy new year ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst thanks frank i guess going back to frank mitsch s sort of question as well on industrial and thinking through the overseas market what exactly are you seeing in europe was europe actually down year over year in the quarter from a volume standpoint can you give us a sense as to how the other regions did and then just given some of the weakness in energy prices and your exposure there should we expect a sequential deceleration in industrial or do you think that would be offset with some of the recovery from weather frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer sure so excluding acquisitions europe was flat and in our industrial segment that was disappointing latin america continues to be challenged as well and so regionally those are the two most significant areas for us outside of north america north america continued to be pretty solid and as i highlighted earlier obviously there s some real strong elements of organic growth that helps drive organic growth through the whole segment up about 3 we don t see a lot of strength in europe right now and so i don t think there s any big disaster but it s not going to be a driver of improved performance in the second half of the year as far as we can tell other than the things that we would drive relative to our map to growth program ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst got it and then just my second question kind of going back to raw materials and pricing did price cost just purely focusing on price cost did that come in where you thought it would during the second quarter relative to your initial expectations and then what is reasonable from our vantage point to kind of think about year over year margin parity for your businesses on a consolidated basis frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer so i think we re making the headway in terms of raw material costs and price increases in our industrial segment and our specialty segment that s not been true in our consumer segment i mentioned silicone that s a big part of it but it s been a certain other packaging categories so our consumer segment is more tilted toward categories like silicone and others that have not eased up and also are more packaging intensive because there s more units but we re continuing to make good progress there and we would expect to make progress across the entirety of our consumer segment customer base by this spring and that as i mentioned earlier in part is in relationship to some line review wins we had last year which came along with some commitments on price that are now annualizing i think that we re starting to see raw materials ease and we re starting to see the benefits of our structural changes and we ll be in a better position in april to tell you what those are they will show up in our results somewhat later than they will in some of our larger competitors because of the difference between fifo and lifo accounting but we ll also be able to provide more data because we have better and more accurate data at our fingertips today certainly at my level than we ve had in the past ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst ok perfect thank you so much frank and best wishes for the year frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer ghansham thank you operator from rbc capital markets we have arun viswanathan please go ahead arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning guys just wanted to understand i guess on industrial i guess relative to your expectations did those results kind of come in where you guys expected them or was there some extra softness and i m also curious just on the margin front was there some extra cost that you potentially incurred that hurt those margins frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer i think the disappointment in our industrial was related to more in the revenue side some of the weather related items that we talked about as well as flat results in europe 50 of our industrial segment is outside of north america and we did not experience growth there and so that was a challenge for us we are making good progress in the margin side and i think that will show up in the coming quarters fx certainly fx also negatively impacted us both on translational and in certain places transactional perspective and again our largest exposure internationally is in our industrial segment arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and then just two quick follow ups so first off the tax rate just wanted to understand do you expect to see that 26 rate from here on my apologies if i missed that frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer that s correct in the third and fourth quarter that s about where we would see taxes arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst ok great and then secondly at the investor day you talked about kind of maintaining a level of sales growth that s required for that 540 basis points of margin improvement do you still see that as relatively achievable or was there potentially some greater slowing that would cause you to potentially adjust that view that growth maybe could be a little bit below where you thought it would be that and that would result in less margin improvement frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer for the things that we control we see that as relatively achievable and in fact in the quarter we did i think between organic growth and acquisitions we re in the 5 5 or 6 range foreign exchange negatively impacted that by two points who knows where that will go the dollar seems to be weakening as we speak today but the direction of the dollar and the stock market are anybody s guess in the coming months and quarters but we feel pretty good about our ability to generate through a combination of organic growth by keeping our nose to the grindstone and our sales and marketing people focused on the market and our customers as well as the regular stream of acquisition activity that we see as possible that those targets are very doable the foreign exchange swings plus or minus will be a variable that we don t control but i think over time we wouldn t expect them to be meaningful but time will tell arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst got it thank you frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from vertical research partners we have kevin mccarthy please go ahead frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning kevin kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good morning how are you frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good thank you kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst a couple of questions as you ve reinstated earnings guidance as i look at the range for the fiscal third quarter and irrespective of the level of the guidance i guess i m impressed that you have a very narrow range of just 0 02 from top to bottom can you comment on the level of your visibility at this point as you move through the map to growth execution and if it turns out several months from now that your earnings are materially better or materially worse than what you re laying out as guidance what are some of the key variables that might be harder to predict right now that could be a swing factor with regard to your near term earnings frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer so i think the great question the variables will be revenues and some of that people would be tired of this but some of that will be weather related so far we seem to be in pretty good shape there and certainly the foreign exchange will be a variable that we don t control so we ll see where that goes it seems to be settling down a little bit and then the third variable which again i mentioned i think we will figure out how to carve out so that it s obvious as to what the impact is but also separate it from our core operating results as this mark to market last year i think we had 3 5 million gains on a pre tax basis in the third quarter rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer more like 5 5 million frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer more like 5 5 million and this year we ll end up certainly with some level of millions of dollars of losses if the market stays where it is so there could be a material swing there that s a non operating item that we will be sure to specifically address those are the variables you separate that and i think the variables are really revenues and weather makes a difference in the third quarter particularly in our consumer segment if you get an early spring a lot of times we ll get strong shipments particularly after the january year end so a lot of our big accounts in february and a big february in consumer can make a big third quarter a weak february consumer means this all gets pushed into the fourth quarter so that s the biggest variable i would see in revenues and where it might come from and then the other s fx i think we have expenses pinned down very well and i think we re continuing to generate a growing level of restructuring savings that we re pretty confident in kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst that s really helpful and with regard to the weather impact have you quantified or attempted to quantify the aggregate impact in the fiscal second quarter and how that might have split between industrial and consumer frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer i don t have that off the top of my head kevin other than knowing that we had disappointing results in the three businesses i mentioned tremco roofing dryvit and some of our consumer product categories that are exterior use products and we believe those shortfalls to our internal plan were related to weather kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst and then last one if i may just coming back to guidance do you feel as though looking ahead to the may quarter that you would be in a position to compare positively on a year over year basis on the bottom line frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst very good thanks very much frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from morgan stanley we have vincent andrews please go ahead vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks i d actually just like to follow up on that fourth quarter question just in terms of and i appreciate the comments you had frank about guidance and obviously we were all including myself ahead of things for 2q and now probably 3q does that extend to 4q it would seem logical if we got 2q wrong and 3q wrong we d probably have 4q wrong as well so i m just kind of asking more specifically about your comfort with the actual consensus number for the fourth quarter frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes i don t think we re in a position to provide guidance for the fourth quarter now i think on the april call we will provide the same type of specific guidance then on the fourth quarter that we have provided in the third quarter and then i think we will be in a better position as we look into next year to provide some more reasonable guidance as i mentioned in hindsight it seems like the right thing to do given all the variabilities and all the restructuring charges that we would have and not knowing the timing of that but certainly in hindsight it did not help us to not be providing some high level of guidance and so i think it was as much a communication hiccup relative to the second quarter and third quarter certainly some of it is performance related but a lot of it s mapped around tax issues last year versus where we ll be this year in the third quarter and expectations on guidance that were never part of what was happening in our industry and what we saw for the year and that was our mistake in communications and we will improve vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst fair enough and i appreciate the candor on that just a couple of other follow ups the wet weather was that primarily a september issue with the hurricanes or was that actually an october and november issue as well frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer it was the wettest record on fall or fall on record or the second wettest fall on record and it was a great frustration relative to we ve mentioned tremco roofing a number of times we ve got good backlog and good order flow and a lot of projects that were delayed or put off or interrupted specifically and it was just a frustrating period of time the same is true for our dryvit business which is all exterior work and it s more anecdotal in terms of measuring what we thought would happen versus consumer takeaway in certain categories that again are more exterior related vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok and maybe just one last quick one if you could just tell us roughly what you think the fx headwind will be in the third quarter and fourth quarter that would be helpful frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes it s hard to say it was two percentage points of sales in q2 i would hope it would be a little bit less than that but i think that s probably a number at this point you can count on that s what i would stick in a model i d say that the dollar s starting to weaken a little bit relative to the fed easing off on further rate increases and so but 2 is probably what i would expect and depending on where things go maybe it won t be quite as negative vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok thanks very much appreciate all the comments frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from keybanc we have mike sison please go ahead mike sison keybanc capital markets analyst hey guys happy new year frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer happy new year mike thank you mike sison keybanc capital markets analyst frank when you think about the fourth quarter i know you don t want to give specific guidance but can you maybe talk about some of the year over year positives that you ll see as tailwinds for the fourth quarter in terms of earnings growth frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer sure so i think the fourth quarter will be the first period where some meaningful map to growth savings will start to be realized we announced five plant closures in this quarter and as i commented on earlier in some cases we have warn act requirements in other cases it s just an internal announcement that obviously once we ve announced something internally it can quickly go external so we feel comfortable in communicating those but in many instances the operations aren t ceased for 60 or 90 days and at that point you re starting to save the dollars the negotiations that we have been having with a lot of our key vendors in terms of volume consolidation and some improvements in pricing in terms have trigger dates of the end of january end of february obviously there s more work to do there but so we feel good about having some meaningful benefits in the fourth quarter i think secondly last year was a very disappointing quarter in our consumer segment for a number of reasons there was a lot of competitive activity and some different changes in the marketplace that all shook out positively for us in terms of market share gains as we got into the early summer months and so i think that will reflect positively on our results in the fourth quarter as well i think those are the principal categories that we see us driving what will be a year over year positive fourth quarter mike sison keybanc capital markets analyst great and then just one quick follow up you talked about acquisitions as still a core focus for rpm any update on the environment any areas that you think you re going to be particularly focused on in acquiring over the next couple of quarters frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer we completed in this last quarter another cleaning category product for rust oleum mold control and that s a pretty exciting category for rust oleum in terms of growth we completed this year a relatively small product line focused on railcar called strathmore with carboline and that s turning into a real nice acquisition there are smaller deals but particularly in the industrial side if we can start to mirror what we ve done in consumer we picked up a nice product line and some good technology that s focused on a particular area and we ve expanded what was a sales force of a dozen people into the pockets of a carboline sales force of 200 people and that s really driving revenues and so we re looking for more deals like that i don t expect our deal flow to be any bigger than what we communicated in november 28 which is somewhere in the 150 million to 200 million a year made up of multiple deals but the deal flow out there is still pretty solid and we re working hard to find more opportunities like that mike sison keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you operator from seaport global securities we have mike harrison please go ahead mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hey good morning frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike harrison seaport global securities analyst kind of sticking with the acquisition theme you did mention nudura is there but it looks like the contribution from nudura was pretty solid in the quarter i know that that s a complement to drive it but i m guessing it does not have the exterior the weather related impacts that drive it so can you just talk a little bit about the performance of nudura in the quarter and maybe help us understand the revenue potential relative to that 40 million annual contribution you mentioned when you acquired that business frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer sure that was a revenue base we re very excited about nudura when you look at the durability particularly as there are concerns around weather related events and if you look at coat changes in relationship to the energy efficiency of the insulated concrete form structure that nudura has we re big we re long nudura we re very bullish about it there are good synergy opportunities with dryvit and there are also good synergy opportunities with the tremco sealants part of our construction products group and as we get into what is typically our march growth and strategy the real challenge for us is to be is to think about how and how much and where we can be most effective in promoting nudura to a larger audience it is one of the building category elements of the future that we believe in and we just got to get out there and promote it and get it specified in greater areas in greater amounts but a very exciting opportunity and a great fit with multiple rpm product areas mike harrison seaport global securities analyst all right and then you mentioned increasing the advertising spend within the consumer business it seems like consumer had kind of the biggest margin shortfall at least relative to my expectations a lot of that was also raw material but just wondering how much the additional advertising spend was maybe weighing on the margin and consumer on a year over year basis frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes i don t know if it is a big difference it s up in the quarter about 2 million and rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer 200 000 frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer no 200 000 so what was up in the quarter only 200 000 year over year and it s up a couple million dollars on the year but it s a category that in light of a focus on cost improvement and restructuring that we re not cutting in fact in certain areas we re promoting and i think we have to do that particularly in light of what s been disappointing consumer takeaway a lot of it we believe is weather related but as we get into the spring as well we need to continuously lead in a lot of these categories to promote the use and work with our major customers to get people in the stores and get people moving in these categories so that s an area that we have deliberately not cut are focused on obviously rusty corrected me it was up 200 000 in the quarter so that s not a big number this quarter mike harrison seaport global securities analyst got it and then a quick one for rusty just in terms of the diluted share count around the end of the quarter i know you didn t redeem that convertible bond until the end of the quarter but it looks like for accounting purposes that convertible was excluded from the share count for the entire quarter is that correct rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer yes for the gaap set of financial statements we re on the two class method and the two class method has a lower share count because we re not including unvested equity awards in the share count and then on the non gaap set of numbers the as adjusted set of numbers with the as adjusted eps it s 0 52 we re using a higher share count because were using the treasury method for shares and that does include the shares from the convert we re going to see the benefit of the convertible redemption in future quarters but we did not get it so much in the second quarter because we redeemed it three days before quarter end mike harrison seaport global securities analyst so maybe a better way to ask the question is what was the diluted share count at the end of the quarter that we should be using for q3 rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer yes in terms of the share count for q3 it will be down about 3 3 million shares for the impact of the convertible so it would be down in the 133 million range for the quarter and then on an annualized basis we should pick up 0 03 to 0 04 mike harrison seaport global securities analyst ok thanks very much operator from northcoast research we have kevin hocevar please go ahead frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer good morning kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer good morning kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst on the pricing agreements that you ve discussions you ve had it sounds like you locked in pricing for february march time frame are those is that across all the segments is it focused it sounds like maybe in consumer to some degree just wondering if you could do some clarity on where the pricing s being realized frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer sure the pricing in our consumer and specialty products has been happening throughout the year we did have some price increases in our consumer businesses earlier in the year and across much of our customer base but in certain areas where we had significant competitive line reviews a year ago and or new product categories as part of our commitments we were locked in for a 12 month period and those lock in periods are expiring this spring kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst gotcha and just the tended 0 12 eps i just want to make sure is that a non gaap number that excludes all the map to growth and other restructuring charges frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes that is exclusive of the whatever the charges will be in the third quarter and again we ll highlight that in detail obviously when we report the quarter kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst ok great thank you very much frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator from jpmorgan we have jeff zekauskas please go ahead jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much your cash flow has improved for the six months by about 30 million but your deferred tax there was a positive change in deferred taxes of about 30 million for the six months year over year and there was also an 11 million positive swing in realized and unrealized marketable securities cash flow can you discuss what those are for the year are these permanent or impermanent and what s driving the changes in deferred taxes in particular rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer sure last year jeff you re seeing a big number on the deferred tax line on the cash flow a use of cash of 32 million and that s really an adjustment to the net income lineup above for some nontax impact of our what i would call our legal entity realignment project last year which allowed us to get some big tax benefits in the second quarter and our tax rate you might remember in the second quarter last year it was only 12 because of this project so that s impacted by that specific item where we basically were able to flip a large amount of our apb 23 reserve as a result of improved utilization of foreign tax credits that resulted from that your next question was on the marketable securities line and we are showing this year a change in that we have proceeds from sales of marketable securities this year of 35 million that was actually cash we ve been able to move from our captive insurance companies which frank mentioned before for use in our operations because our captives were a bit overcapitalized and as a result we were able to get a net positive cash flow if you look at the prior year on the marketable securities lines that s more normal activity each quarter as we rebalance our investment portfolio jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst so the tax rate that you re now talking about of 26 for the third quarter like in theory why shouldn t your tax rate be closer to 21 plus or minus a little bit and is that a more reasonable forecast for 2019 your tax rate i think was 28 in this quarter i don t understand why it s so high rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer yes the 21 is actually the u s statutory rate frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer it s a combination of jurisdictional mix and now for the first time ever with the u s tax rate meaningfully favorably better than most foreign operations the jurisdictional mix will likely quarter by quarter be higher because of the third of our business or so that is on outside of the united states so unlike past years for us and other companies where you would end up with actual tax rate somewhat below the u s statutory rate which was at least in the developed world the highest in the world now you re likely to see a higher tax rate rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer and also we have state taxes too included on top of the federal of 21 frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer but the biggest part of it s jurisdictional and now we tend to average up our tax rate because of our foreign income at higher tax rates than where the u s is so that s the benefit of tax reform that i think we re all enjoying jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst what are your highest tax rate jurisdictions frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer i can t answer that off the top of my head right now but i can tell you it s almost every country in which we do business outside of the united states in the developing world jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok great thank you so much operator from great lakes review we have a follow up from jason rodgers please go ahead jason rodgers great lakes review analyst appreciate you taking a follow up i just had a quick one for rusty if the diluted share count was 131 7 million in the second quarter and that did not include the 3 3 million share reduction from the convertible then why should the share count be around 133 million in the third rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer yes we don t know the third for sure because we could either use the two class method or the treasury method it depends on earnings we ve picked the one kristine that s most anti dilutive right so that would depend on what earnings are during the quarter so the third quarter is a bit uncertain just due to the nature of the season and we re at a low earnings point we re not sure which method exactly we ll be on but we can tell you for sure we ve redeemed those shares and there s 3 3 million shares that used to be in our diluted share count under the treasury method that aren t there jason rodgers great lakes review analyst ok thank you rusty gordon vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator from gabelli company we have a follow up from rosemarie morbelli please go ahead rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst thank you this is for rusty as long as there is so much volatility regarding the mark to market of the securities of your portfolio why not is it at all possible to take it out of the adjusted numbers so we look at operations on an apples to apples basis eliminating the volatility of that item frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer we will work with our auditors to address that in the third quarter and certainly that s what we aspire to it s a non operating item it will be pluses and minuses and so we need to work on how we would do that and then just make it a permanent adjustment and carve it out of our operating results rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst ok and if we look at the second quarter what was the impact of that item on a per share basis i m assuming that it has there is a tax impact on it and i have no idea what the rate is i am assuming it s not your corporate rate frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer it is 0 05 in the quarter that s why i mentioned that item alone was the difference between being flat year over year on the eps line and the aggravating part of that accounting reg is again in the past you would only recognize a gain or loss if they were realized as you manage your captive insurance companies to where you would have to liquidate to meet insurance needs and things like that or offset gains and losses now you mark to market but because they re not realized they re not tax deductible and so if you have an unrealized 5 million hit it s not actually tax deductible until you effectively sell those securities and have an actually realized loss so it s a really double whammy in terms of your bottom line so again we re going to work to figure out the appropriate way to address it and then carve it out of our results in future periods rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst so just making sure i get this properly instead of 0 52 then you would have reported 0 57 from operations adjusted in the second quarter frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer i think that s the simplistic way of looking at it i think that s right rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst yes i like simple and looking at the third quarter in that 0 10 to 0 12 do you have some kind of an impact from that particular item incorporated in those numbers frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer yes we have about a 5 million negative impact on a year over year basis in those items between the gains we realized in the prior year and an anticipated loss this year but we won t know the actual number until we close the quarter and whether the stock market between now and the end of the quarter is up 1 000 points or down 1 000 points or somewhere in between rosemarie morbelli gabelli company analyst ok thank you operator thank you we will now turn it back to frank sullivan for closing remarks frank sullivan chairman and chief executive officer thank you brandon thank you very much for your participation in our call today i d also like to thank the rpm associates around the world who are continuing to generate solid growth in a challenging environment most importantly we appreciate your questions and your commitment as we continue to execute our

as we start a new year it s time to polish the crystal ball with our 13th annual predictions for the economy share and property for the 12 months ahead we also come clean on how our predictions from this time last year actually panned out in reality harsh but fair we reckon if you re going to put yourself on the line there has to be some accountability an old economist mate of ours always says if you re going to forecast do it often so you can keep changing your mind or forecast so far into the future that when you get there people have forgotten what you ve said the sections in italics are what we predicted this time last year for 2018 it s fair to say the only people who seemed to have made money last year was the government with its river of tax gold and tight spending economy economic growth around 3 per cent unemployment below 5 5 per cent aussie dollar to stay above us70 cents if there was an interest rate hike it would be at very end of the year our predictions for the australian economy were pretty right as we entered our record breaking 28th consecutive year of positive economic growth our economic performance was highlighted by the prestigious london based the economist financial magazine with a 15 page cover story titled aussie rules what the rest of the world can learn from australia overall 2018 was another strong year which has resulted in the federal budget coming into surplus much earlier than expected but 2019 looks a lot more uncertain unemployment in 2018 remained below 5 5 per cent the red hot us economy is under pressure from four interest rate hikes a potential trade war with china and erratic policy decisions from the trump administration some market analysts are factoring in the possibility of a us recession in the next 18 months the ripple effect of a slowing us economy and trade war will be significant to global growth and australia will not be immune but we re in good shape to fight any global headwinds and also the slowdown in our property market the federal budget is in good shape employment is strong and trade balance solid we d expect no change in official interest rates for 2019 if there is a change it is more likely to be a cut in rates if the economy gets bad from those global influences economic growth of around 3 per cent slightly less than other market predictions still looks achievable which would be helped by

on november 23 three militants of the balochistan liberation army attacked the prc consulate in karachi the latest in a series of assaults by baloch militants on prc projects and personnel in pakistan global times november 24 baloch opposition to the china pakistan economic corridor cpec is a primary motivating factor for these attacks with many balochis alleging that cpec a flagship component of china s belt and road initiative bri exploits baloch resources while only benefiting the chinese and non baloch pakistanis express tribune december 17 2015 south asian governments are becoming increasingly discontent with bri projects in august pakistan s new government expressed interest in reviewing the cpec contracts that they perceive to be over priced unnecessary or excessively in the favor of prc companies dawn september 11 similar sentiments have been expressed by the new maldivian government which is reviewing bri contracts signed during the rule of former president abdulla yameen economic times november 26 such actions raise questions as to whether south asian states might scale down or even cancel bri projects a game changer for pakistan when prc president xi jinping unveiled plans for bri in 2013 it evoked great interest in many south asian countries as former ambassador in the sri lanka ministry of foreign affairs dr john gooneratne stated in an interview with the author bri holds out the prospect of helping to bridge the significant infrastructure financing gap increase connectivity link local markets to regional and global value chains and thereby increase trade and investment in the participating countries moreover unlike western governments and financial institutions whose loans require developing countries to meet conditions for good governance democracy and human rights beijing was willing to extend significant loans for infrastructure development without these conditions the island august 11 2017 attracted by the potential benefits of bri pakistan bangladesh sri lanka the maldives and nepal joined the ambitious prc led initiative during xi s visit to islamabad in april 2015 the prc and pakistan signed agreements to establish cpec the deal was especially appealing to pakistan as its poor security situation made attracting foreign investment difficult beijing pledged funds to cpec to the tune of 46 billion which was subsequently increased to 62 billion over a 15 year period dwarfing the 7 5 billion in aid the united states had extended over a five year period to pakistan in 2009 dawn april 22 2015 cpec envisioned linking the gwadar port in pakistan s balochistan province with kashgar in china s xinjiang province through a network of highways railways oil and gas pipelines and fiber optic cables with special economic zones and energy projects to be established along the way the projects were expected to create jobs and business opportunities for locals attract foreign investment enhance energy production and boost the pakistani economy pakistan observer august 16 2017 it was widely hailed in pakistan as a game changer daily times august 30 2016 loans for infrastructure in bangladesh sri lanka and maldives much like cpec bangladesh sri lanka and maldives also sought financial support for their respective infrastructure projects in the case of bangladesh the prc was willing to finance infrastructure projects that appealed to the priorities of the bangladeshi government thereby filling a void left by reluctant western financiers bnp paribas and the norwegian government s sovereign wealth fund for instance had refused to finance the rampal coal fired power plant at khulna for environmental reasons daily star june 26 2015 the world bank cancelled a 1 2 billion credit for the padma multipurpose bridge project citing high level corruption world bank june 29 2012 in contrast according to humayun kabir former ambassador and secretary in bangladesh s ministry of foreign affairs china s focus on and assistance to infrastructure development in bangladesh aligned well with the latter s needs and priorities this attracted bangladesh to join bri in order to benefit from its economic potential similarly post war sri lanka required significant funding for infrastructure building however as dr gooneratne explains sri lanka s usual western donors were reluctant to extend support given the mahinda rajapaksa government s reluctance to carry out an examination into how the war was fought and possible human rights violations this was not the case with the prc which not only shielded the rajapaksa regime from scrutiny at international human rights forums but also extended loans without conditions under bri the prc provided loans and built a deep sea port at hambantota an international airport at mattala and a 900 megawatt coal fired power plant at norocholai the colombo port city project among others as with sri lanka former maldives president abdulla yameen also turned to beijing for financial support beijing s support of yameen s authoritarian rule in the face of strong criticism from india and the west encouraged yameen to embrace bri prior to 2011 sino maldivian relations were negligible beijing did not even have an embassy in male however during yameen s presidency maldives joined bri and entered into a free trade agreement that was overwhelmingly in beijing s favor under bri the prc extended loans and expertise to maldives for several infrastructure projects including the sinamale bridge linking male to hulhule island and a massive housing project on hulhumale counter balancing india for landlocked nepal bri was an opportunity to improve infrastructure and connectivity with world markets and more importantly reduce its dependence on india nepal s need to become less dependent on india was underscored in 2015 16 when it was believed that india gave tacit consent to impose an economic blockade that paralyzed nepal causing enormous hardship to its people this became one of the driving motivations for nepal to reach out to the prc and sign on to bri in may 2017 under bri the prc is building energy and transport infrastructure foremost among these is a railway line linking kerung in the tibet autonomous region with kathmandu and the tourist towns of pokhara and lumbini in nepal this is expected to boost nepal s trade and tourism industries the wire november 22 the outliers three south asian countries india bhutan and afghanistan are not participants in bri india s opposition to bri stems primarily from the fact that cpec runs through gilgit baltistan disputed territory that is under pakistan s control but to which india lays claim india says that it cannot be involved in an initiative that violates india s sovereignty and territorial integrity ministry of external affairs india april 5 additionally india is concerned that bri has dramatically expanded the prc s presence in the region it maintains that bri has strategic motivations and that the prc is driving south asian countries into deep debt to increase its own leverage indian express may 15 2017 india has had limited success in persuading its neighbors to avoid involvement in bri only bhutan and afghanistan have maintained their distance from the initiative geopolitical rivalries have kept bhutan and afghanistan out of bri under pressure from india bhutan does not have official diplomatic or economic relations with the prc and has yet to get involved with bri however the prc is assiduously wooing bhutan and businessmen and youth in bhutan are increasingly supportive of establishing official ties with beijing and joining bri connectivity with global markets that bri promises makes it an attractive initiative for remote and landlocked bhutan china brief april 20 2017 like bhutan land locked afghanistan could benefit from bri s connectivity with distant markets indeed pakistan and the prc are keen to include afghanistan in cpec as this would contribute to the corridor s profitability however kabul has repeatedly declared that as long as pakistan denies it overland access to india it will not allow pakistan similar access to central asian countries although afghanistan has signed a memorandum of understanding on bri with china it has yet to become a full participant in the initiative outlook afghanistan august 16 increasing caution about bri involvement south asian countries are becoming increasingly cautious about involvement in bri and its implications for the region many governments are calling for renegotiation of bri contracts sri lanka s experience with debt has become the primary cautionary example in this regard by 2015 sri lanka reportedly owed 8 billion to the prc with the hambantota port failing to attract business and colombo unable to repay its loans sri lanka ended up handing over this port and 15 000 acres of land around it to the prc on a 99 year lease in addition to over commitment of governments to bri a lack of transparency in the deals has deepened public skepticism of the benefits of involvement in bri for south asian countries in the case of sri lanka it was the secretive manner in which deals were negotiated that drew public ire there were stories of underhand money dealings that dampened the enthusiasm of the public even pakistan the prc s closest ally and south asia s biggest proponent of bri is pushing back on the initiative in 2017 when the prc introduced more restrictive conditions for funding of the 14 billion diamer bhasha dam pakistan pulled the project from cpec s ambit as it felt that the conditions were not doable and against pakistan s interests express tribune november 15 2017 more recently pakistan s new government announced that it is cutting down on loans from the prc under cpec and has reduced 2 billion in loans for rail projects dawn october 2 in contrast to other bri participants bangladesh has been cautious from the start always a conservative borrower bangladesh s loans have remained within its capacity to pay back it has drawn lessons from sri lanka s experience and has been more conscious about the risks that could emerge from over commitment to bri projects moreover dhaka is not overly dependent on the prc for support as it has managed to attract investment from india japan and others as demonstrated by the payra port project this has enabled bangladesh to deal with the prc from a position of relative strength in 2016 dhaka turned down china s offer to develop a deep sea port at sonadia in favor of japan s proposal for a deep sea port just 25 km away at matarbari which was considered to be more beneficial to bangladesh china brief june 21 2016 looking ahead sri lanka pakistan and maldives may not be as overburdened by debt as they are today had they followed bangladesh s example of cautious borrowing selective involvement in projects and rejection of economically or strategically unviable initiatives unfortunately they accepted the prc s vision as their own and embraced bri without questioning whether it was in their own long term interests the defeat of bri friendly south asian leaders in elections has been widely described as setback for the prc such interpretations gained momentum when their successors in sri lanka pakistan and the maldives promised to review contracts with the prc however subsequent events indicate that while concern over debt burdens is rising in the region the future of bri projects in south asia has not dimmed in sri lanka contracts on hambantota port and colombo port city that were renegotiated and signed by the pro west ranil wickremesinghe government ended up being more favorable to the prc than the contracts originally signed by the pro prc rajapaksa the citizen november 25 in fact the government went on to sign even more agreements for bri projects pakistan s prime minister imran khan said he would request that beijing realign cpec s goals to his government s agenda but prc authorities reportedly brushed aside his proposals to re negotiate cpec deals ipp review november 29 burdened by crippling debt bri s south asian member states are too weak to re negotiate or cancel project terms there are high costs for withdrawing from these projects in addition although the governments of india and some western nations are highly critical of bri they lack the deep pockets that the prc has to fund these projects moreover the prc s bri partners in south asia are aware that economic development could suffer without the infrastructure improvements promised by bri however while south asian countries are less optimistic about bri than they were a few years ago and continue to raise concerns over the debt burden and contract terms this cannot be interpreted yet as a major setback for the prc s ambitions so far we have seen little concrete change come from pushback on bri initiatives in south asia at least the prc seems on course to realize its global ambitions through bri dr sudha ramachandran is an independent researcher and journalist based in bangalore india she has written extensively on south asian peace and conflict political and security issues for the diplomat asia times and geopolitics this article appeared originally at the jamestown foundation s china brief notes author s interview dr john

as controversial new leaders find their feet and crises continue here are the stories to look out for this year in the last 12 months latin america has seen a series of high stakes elections the international monetary fund imf deliver its biggest ever bailout package and venezuela s economic collapse explode into the most severe migration crisis in the region s history as nationalists take the reigns of the region s two largest economies and corruption scandals continue to dog politicians from mexico city to montevideo here are the stories to look out for in 2019 1 brazil s bolsonaro shakes things up january 1 saw jair bolsonaro brazil s first right wing president since the country s 1964 1985 military dictatorship assume office the controversial former military captain made a series of disparaging remarks about women lgbt people and black brazilians worrying many that social policies may be rolled back under his presidency the fears appeared well founded as bolsonaro issued a series of executive orders impinging on the rights of minorities as one of his first acts as president bolsonaro s first week in office has also seen the head of the country s environmental protection agency resign following criticism from the president and troops deployed to stop criminal attacks in the northern city of fortaleza his pledge to move brazil s embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem has also raised eyebrows in a country which is the world s largest exporter of halal meat supporters are hopeful however that bolsonaro can tackle rampant corruption and crack down on crime in brazil which saw a record 63 880 homicides in 2017 and bolsonaro himself stabbed on the campaign trail the appointment of a graduate of the university of chicago whose alumni reformed chile s economy under dictator augusto pinochet as economy minister has also raised investor hopes that bolsonaro s brazil will be good for business 2 a mexican maverick makes his mark andres manuel lopez obrador a leftist populist became mexico s new president in december but even before entering office amlo as he is known was making his influence felt and causing a headache for investors in october the then president elect said the future of a multibillion dollar airport project near mexico city would be decided in a public referendum less than one percent of the electorate took part in the four day vote which rejected the continuation of the project amlo has vowed to honour the results of the referendum putting his administration on a collision course with investors and causing the peso to plunge tackling the extreme violence that has plagued mexico for more than a decade is high on amlo s agenda with his predecessor enrique pena nieto receiving harsh criticism for his failure to address the gang and drugs related bloodshed 180627074650133 delivering on that front will be pretty hard for amlo in the coming year because state governments and local governments are in on it with a lot of the cartels and they benefit so it s going to be pretty hard for him to crack down on that without a complete purge of the political class of mexico s various levels of government max klaver senior analyst at foreign brief a geopolitical risk analysis website told al jazeera the new administration will also be judged on how it tackles migration during his campaign amlo promised to improve job prospects in mexico so that migration would be an option not a necessity and in a move which likely pleased his northern neighbour the mexican president made a deal with leaders from honduras guatemala and el salvador to create a fund to stem the flow of us bound migrants one of his first acts in office 3 venezuela plunges deeper into crisis hundreds of thousands of people fled venezuela s deepening economic crisis last year while widespread shortages of food and medicine made daily life a struggle for those who remained 180327150648624 venezuelans are losing their purchasing power on a daily basis and the lack of access to food has caused malnutrition venezuelan journalist nayrobis rodriguez told al jazeera with the imf predicting an inflation rate of 10 000 000 percent in 2019 and president nicolas maduro continuing to blame the economic crisis on an imperialist conspiracy the situation is likely to deteriorate even further in the next 12 months however as migrants and refugees stream into neighbouring countries the regional response is beginning to grow teeth in september seven countries presented a petition to the international criminal court icc to investigate maduro for crimes against humanity while colombia s ivan duque whose country has accepted the most venezuelans since the crisis began in 2015 continues to butt heads with the colombian president in an increasingly bitter war of words january 10 will see maduro begin his second six year term in office despite a dozen latin american countries and canada saying they will not recognise maduro s new mandate which was won in a vote largely boycotted by the opposition and deemed illegitimate by the international community 4 migration strains relations the us enters 2019 locked into a government shutdown centred on funding for president donald trump s wall on the border with mexico migration has taken centre stage in us politics in recent months as trump sought to sow fear over the thousands of central american migrants and refugees who made their way to the border to apply for asylum the question of where the migrants will wait out the asylum process has placed a strain on the us s relationship with mexico despite trump s tough stance on migration domestic instability and violence in several central american countries are likely to continue to force people to leave their homes in 2019 as the political and economic situations in a lot of central american countries worsen and as us policies towards a lot of those countries become a bit more draconian and catalyse the problems that cause migration in the first place i think it follows that migration will likely increase from those countries analyst max klaver said regional ties are also set to be increasingly strained by large numbers of people crossing into neighbouring countries to flee the crises in venezuela and nicaragua with public backlash expected to increase as public services in host countries struggle to cope with the influx of new arrivals 5 macri fights to survive argentina s economic crisis the argentine peso lost a third of its value in 2018 prompting protests against austerity measures and a staggering 57bn bailout package from the imf the largest ever given by the international body after such dramatic upheaval the economy is likely to be on voter s minds as they head to the polls in october s presidential election though embroiled in a myriad of ongoing corruption investigations including one involving billions of dollars in bribes for public works contracts former president cristina fernandez de kirchner remains popular with voters and is expected to be president mauricio macri s main competition come october nicolas saldias a researcher at the washington dc based wilson center focusing on argentine politics and economics said that the benefits of the imf package might not come quickly enough to convince voters to back macri the economy is doing very badly macri is dealing with the worst recession since at least 2009 and the country in 2019 will only be recovering it won t actually be growing saldias said if the economy begins to grow in the second half of the year that will give macri some goodwill if there s a strong enough recovery it will certainly help president macri if the economy s doing better he may be able to pull out a victory in the second round in november he told al jazeera 6 nicaragua s crackdown continues widespread protests rocked the presidency of daniel ortega in nicaragua in april quickly turning deadly as the government began a violent crackdown on dissent nicaragua is experiencing one of the worst human rights crisis in its recent history erika guevara rosas americas director at amnesty international told al jazeera at least 322 people have been killed since protests began mostly by agents of the state or pro government armed groups and more than 2 000 people have been injured according to amnesty thousands more have fled mostly to neighbouring costa rica ortega has said thieves and coup mongers are responsible for the unrest sending journalists and protesters to jail on terrorism charges 180928072838315 as the situation on the ground becomes increasingly dangerous government repression shows no signs of easing during the last weeks many well known human rights organisations have been shut down and their leaders persecuted by the government independent media outlets have been closed as well and journalists have been criminalised or forced to leave the country guevara rosas said given the lack of political will and the negligent denial by the government of the serious human rights violations occurring in the country it is expected that the situation will worsen with the suspension of human rights organisations and other civil society groups there are no monitoring mechanisms and other forms of accountability available to citizens in nicaragua 7 cuba braces for change in april 2018 miguel diaz canel bermudez became the first person outside the castro family to lead cuba since the country s revolution six decades ago 181111192818890 despite widespread use of the somoscontinuidad we are continuity hashtag by diaz canel and his ministers there have been various indications that change may be afoot on the communist run island in december alone the government reversed or delayed three controversial proposals after unprecedented public pushback in a country where for decades the government has issued most laws and regulations with little public debate cubans will get their say again in a public referendum on the new constitution scheduled for february 24 widely seen as a means of invigorating cuba s crumbling economy which recorded a meagre 1 2 percent growth in 2018 and has similar projections for next year the reforms if passed would be the most significant political change in cuba for more than four decades 180421105841278 however human rights organisations and analysts have raised questions about how much change is possible while the rigid one party system remains in place and many aspects of life on the island remain under state control it is similar to passing legislation in the us that everyone will own a house without the government having the financial means to provide it without major changes to the system cuba will remain a country struggling to develop said carlos seigle a professor of economics at rutgers university 8 a test for bolivia s morales evo morales has led bolivia since 2006 as its first indigenous president he is a political icon in the andean country celebrated for extending the enfranchisement of the majority indigenous population and improving the economy through partial nationalisation of the oil and gas sector however morales s reputation has taken a beating in recent years after he asked the supreme court to nullify the results of a 2016 referendum which rejected his bid to run for a fourth term the institution which is tightly bound to the presidency went a step further and scrapped term limits altogether for every political office in the country morales is now up for re election in october but the road ahead looks rocky as opposition is growing including among some of his supporters journalist and political analyst raul penaranda told al jazeera that by ignoring the referendum result and running again morales is undermining the democracy he championed during his early administrations and the constitution that he himself created what he has shown is that he does not believe in democracy and he does not believe in the popular vote penaranda said 9 international scandals corruption is never far from the headlines in latin america but 2018 was notable for the number of prominent figures who came under investigation as far reaching corruption probes around the region widened their nets more of the same is anticipated in the next 12 months as both bolsonaro and amlo dig in on campaign promises to quash corruption in their countries and ongoing investigations in peru argentina brazil and colombia are expected to reach their conclusions guatemala has already made headlines for expelling a un backed anti corruption commission which has been investigating president jimmy morales from the country in january if we re looking for silver linings i think it s been nice to see that there has been a very solid and inspiring mobilisation of citizen activism demanding justice and demanding accountability on behalf of their elected officials said analyst max klaver i expect that that s what we ll continue to see but these are issues that are really woven into the political fabric of a lot of these countries i think in the next year and beyond there will probably be more things will be uncovered and this likely goes deeper than it already is and it s pretty deep already he told al jazeera meanwhile in chile an unprecedented investigation into historic sexual abuse by the country s catholic church now the largest clerical sex abuse and cover up probe in latin american history will be turning up the heat leading up to the vatican s anti abuse summit scheduled for february 10 china extends its influence chinese investment in latin america and the caribbean has increased exponentially in the last decade or so with direct investment surging from less than 50bn in 2006 to almost 250bn in 2017 according to the brookings institute a washington dc based think tank us disengagement with the region including its withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership has made space for a new global power to invest in much needed infrastructure projects and china has stepped up to the plate offering the region a place in president xi jinping s trademark one belt one road initiative trump s continued and or increased antagonism towards latin american countries could push key economies especially mexico and colombia to seek stronger relations with china max nathanson global business manager for the governor of colorado and a former research fellow at american university s china latin america sustainable investments initiative told al jazeera china is now a leading commercial partner for several latin american countries including brazil argentina and chile but concerns are mounting over the possible diplomatic effect of increasing sino latin american relations in 2018 el salvador and the dominican republic cut ties with taiwan and established full relations with china the majority of taiwan s 17 remaining diplomatic allies are small cash strapped countries in latin america and the caribbean all of whom could come under increasing chinese influence in the year ahead 170514191145281 beijing also plays a key role in propping up maduro s government in venezuela through investment in its oil sector but as prices fluctuate and the country becomes more unstable this may change it appears that its commercial relationship with caracas has thus far been prioritised over human rights concerns but if the venezuelan oil ceases to be profitable china may change course nathanson said other stories to watch

foreign exchange headwinds our beauty segment continues to focus on appliances which benefited from new product introductions and online growth mr mininberg continued our adjusted operating margin for the quarter primarily reflects our strategic choices to increase incremental digital marketing spend and new product introductions for our leadership brands as expected this quarter we also started to

from leadership brands increased 4 9 to 343 4 million compared to 327 3 million these factors were partially offset by a decline in the personal care category and the discontinuation of certain brands

consolidated sg a as a percentage of sales increased by 1 9 percentage points to 28 0 of net sales compared to 26 1 the increase is primarily due to higher advertising expense increased freight costs increased share based compensation expense and higher product claim expense these factors were partially offset by the favorable comparative impact of foreign currency exchange and forward contract settlements the favorable comparative impact of restructuring charges in the same period last year and lower amortization expense consolidated operating income was 61 3 million or 14 2 of net sales compared to 67 3 million or 16 0 of net sales the decrease in consolidated operating margin primarily reflects higher advertising expense the impact of tariff increases higher freight expense and

comparative impact of restructuring charges of 1 1 million lower amortization expense and the favorable margin impact from leadership brand growth the effective tax rate was 6 9 compared to 8 2 for

2019 compared to third quarter fiscal 2018 housewares net sales increased by 11 4 or 14 7 million due to point of sale growth and incremental distribution with existing domestic brick and mortar customers an increase in overall online sales and new product introductions these factors were partially offset by lower club channel sales and a reduction in inventory by a key online retailer operating margin was 20 9 compared to 23 2 the 2 3 percentage point decrease was primarily due to higher advertising expense higher annual incentive compensation expense related to strong current year performance higher freight expense and higher rent expense related to previously announced new office space these factors were partially offset by the margin impact of more favorable product and channel mix and the favorable impact of increased operating leverage from net sales growth housewares adjusted operating income increased 2 7 to 32 6 million or 22 8 of segment net sales compared to 31 7 million or 24 7 of segment net sales health home net sales decreased 0 7 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of net foreign currency fluctuations of 1 1 million or 0 6 and a core business decline of 0 3 million or 0 2 the core business decline primarily reflects lower online sales and the unfavorable comparative impact from international distribution gains in the prior year period this was compounded by a deceleration of growth in china ecommerce and a corresponding buildup of inventory in the channel these factors were partially offset by incremental distribution and shelf space gains with existing domestic customers and strong seasonal category growth operating margin was 10 2 compared to 14 6 the decrease was primarily due to higher advertising expense increased promotional spending and trade support with retail customers tariff increases a less favorable product and channel mix and higher personnel expense these factors were partially offset by the favorable comparative

unfavorably impacted by net foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 0 6 million or 0 6 operating margin was 12 2 compared to 9 6 the increase is primarily due to the net favorable comparative

actions that have not been resolved with a key customer in two of our product categories and a deceleration of growth in china ecommerce with corresponding high inventory levels in the channel for one of our product categories and the impact that we believe trade tensions are having on both the u s and chinese consumers the company s net sales outlook continues to assume the severity of the cough

adjusted effective tax rate adjusted income adjusted diluted eps ebitda and adjusted ebitda non gaap measures that are discussed in the accompanying press release or in the preceding tables may be considered non gaap financial information as contemplated by sec regulation g rule 100 accordingly we are providing the preceding tables that reconcile these measures to their corresponding gaap based measures presented in our condensed consolidated statements of income in the accompanying tables to the press release the company believes that these non gaap measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations we believe that these non gaap financial measures in combination with the company s financial results calculated in accordance with gaap provide investors with additional perspective regarding the impact of certain charges on net income and earnings per share we also believe that these non gaap measures facilitate a more direct comparison of the company s performance with its competitors we further believe that including the excluded charges would not accurately reflect the underlying performance of the company s continuing operations for the period in which the charges are incurred even though such charges may be incurred and reflected in the company s gaap financial results in the near future additionally the non gaap measures are used by management for measuring and evaluating the company s performance the material limitation associated with the use of the non gaap measures is that the non gaap measures do not reflect the full economic impact of the company s activities these non gaap measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not an alternative to gaap financial information and may be calculated differently than non gaap financial information disclosed by other companies accordingly undue reliance should not be placed on non gaap information 2 leadership brand net sales consists of revenue from the oxo honeywell braun pur hydro flask vicks and hot tools brands 3 charges incurred in conjunction with the company s restructuring

china s foreign debt has been rising rapidly and that s becoming an increasingly big problem for the country and potentially the world officially china lists its outstanding external debt at 1 9 trillion for a 13 trillion economy that s not a major amount but focusing on the headline number significantly understates the underlying risks short term debt accounted for 62 percent of the total as of september according to official data meaning that 1 2 trillion will have to be rolled over this year just as worrying is the speed of increase total external debt has increased 14 percent in the past year and 35 percent since the beginning of 2017 external debt is no longer a trivial slice of china s foreign exchange reserves which stood at just over 3 trillion at the end of november little changed from two years earlier short term foreign debt increased to 39 percent of reserves in september from 26 percent in march 2016 the true picture may be more precarious china s external debt was estimated at between 3 trillion and 3 5 trillion by daiwa capital markets in an august report in other words total foreign liabilities could be understated by as much as 1 5 trillion after accounting for borrowing in financial centers such as hong kong new york and the caribbean islands that isn t included in the official tally circumstances aren t moving in china s favor the nation s companies rushed to borrow in dollars when there was a 3 percent to 5 percent spread between chinese and u s interest rates and the yuan was expected to strengthen borrowing offshore was cheaper and offered the additional bonus of likely currency gains now the spread in official short term yields has shrunk to near zero and the yuan has been depreciating for most of the past year refinancing debt in dollars has become harder and more risky beijing s policies have exacerbated the buildup of foreign debt to promote xi jinping s belt and road initiative the president s landmark foreign policy endeavor china has been borrowing dollars on international markets and lending around the world for everything from kenyan railways to pakistani business parks with this year and 2020 being the peak years for repayments china faces dollar funding pressure to repay their dollar debts chinese firms will either have to draw from the central bank s foreign exchange reserves a prospect beijing is unlikely to allow or buy dollars on international markets this creates a new set of problems there are only 617 billion yuan 90 billion of offshore renminbi deposits in hong kong available to buy dollars if china was to push firms to bring debt back onshore this would necessitate significant outflows that would push down the yuan s value against the dollar international dollar investors need to be wary of chinese linked investments local government financing vehicles and belt and road borrowers may seem quasi sovereign quality but any shift in the willingness to roll over dollar debt could create a funding crunch with the u s federal reserve raising rates and reducing its balance sheet chinese companies could face paying more for capital in dollars than in yuan bulls have long argued that china s financial risks are contained because of the country s low levels of external debt and large foreign exchange reserves that has changed china s external debt has been increasing by an average of 70 billion per quarter since the beginning of 2017 if it keeps rising beijing will have the unpalatable choice of burning through its reserves or letting the yuan fall both of which would carry additional risks china and the world need to think clearly about this growing dollar debt dependence any cessation of funding could have severe and unforeseen consequences source bloomberg

by lance roberts the tremor before the quake and the fed s 450 billion balance sheet reduction the combination of rate hikes and balance sheet reductions from the federal reserve in 2018 sucked up global u s dollar liquidity and put emerging markets under immense pressure in 2018 emerging market equities were 20 30 lower from february through october then the s p played catch up to the downside this combined with tariffs from the white house has placed global manufacturing in a significant slowdown that has begun to circle back into the united states after all over 60t of global gdp is outside the usa lawrence mcdonald fed cave athon driving stocks higher for now why did fed chairman jerome powell s comments on friday get such a ringing endorsement from the equity market the answer is simple the driver to market movement is not valuations rather it is the degree of the system s liquidity condition valuations generally don t matter much when liquidity is injected and expanding price earnings ratios don t end bull markets but when markets perceive a drying up in liquidity or central bankers pivot as in late 2018 markets suffer watch the money the problem is not rising interest rates in 2019 regardless of the fed s actions this year and i continue to believe there will be no fed fund hikes this year the bloated fed balance sheet will be running off as quantitative easing qe is reversed the relationship between liquidity and capital markets volatility is inversely related that is why in the first half of 2018 i called for a new regime of volatility which we have gotten in spades since late september 2018 and that is why i see a continuation of heightened volatility throughout this year tightened liquidity last week dennis gartman produced this chart of the declining monetary base my pal john mauldin after seeing the above chart asked dr lacey hunt to explain the ramifications here was his response there are two important equations that show the potential power of the monetary base mb m2 mb x m the money multiplier world dollar liquidity mb foreign official holdings of us treasury securities 1 means that that the base is not money but that it can be turned into money but only if little m cooperates the determinants of little m are known unlike those of the velocity of money currently mb is declining and m is countervailing to a slight degree but the drop in the base and the increased federal funds rate has resulted in sharp slowdown in m2 growth from a peak of 8 per annum to slightly less than 3 9 per annum now slower m2 growth resulted in a sharp slowdown in nominal gdp in the third quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter velocity of money appears to have declined and combined with slow m2 growth has resulted in an even lower rate of growth in nominal gdp this trend should continue well into 2019 thus the academic economist would say that the aggregate demand curve is shifting downward cutting the upward sloping aggregate supply curve at a lower rate of growth in nominal gdp with a reduced pace of growth in both real gdp and inflation 2 means that world dollar liquidity declines when the base falls unless it is countervailed by an increase in foreign official holdings of treasury securities both of these components constitute tier one capital and can be leveraged presently both components of world dollar are falling draining liquidity in global markets tangible signs of this include a sharp slowdown in m2 growth in japan the eurocurrency zone and china a drop in world stock and commodity prices as well as synchronized deceleration in major foreign economies chinese money growth recently fell to the lowest in four decades while japanese money growth was below the trough in two of the last three recessions equation 2 holds as long as the fed is de facto the world s central bank one other point excess reserves have declined far more sharply than the monetary base serving to severely restrict the us depository institutions excess reserves have dropped from a peak of 2 7 trillion to 1 6 trillion quantitative tightening cut excess reserves about approximately 400 billion while the first eight hikes in federal funds rate reduced excess reserves about 700 billion we don t have sufficient data post the ninth increase in the funds rate to yet measure its impact qt if sustained will reduced excess reserves 50 billion per month in 2019 or 600 billion for the year thus excess reserves would drop to slightly less than 1 trillion by the end of this year peter boockvar noted last week that in the fourth quarter of 2017 the combined asset purchases of the fed european central bank ecb and bank of japan boj were 100 billion per month the total dropped to zero in late 2018 and this quarter will turn negative to withdrawals of roughly 20 billion per month this is a lot of liquidity coming out of the financial system as worrisome is the extended nature of the worldwide economic recovery that is now petering out and the political turmoil on our shores the path of global economic growth has grown more ambiguous the data below underscore the weakening trajectory of worldwide growth china 52 4 to 49 4 germany 63 3 to 51 5 eurozone 60 6 to 51 4 canada 57 1 to 53 6 united states 61 3 to 54 1 recent data are worsening as an example germany s factory orders just announced fell by 5 the greatest amount in six years we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us source zero hedge meanwhile the ratio of corporate debt to gdp makes a new high a zero interest rate policy made debt a far cheaper source of capital than equity and corporations responded in kind by borrowing from banks and accelerating issuance of debt in the public market but as i have written debt loads in both the private and public sectors are untenable and pose substantive cycle risks credit markets have grown concerned with the economic slowdown and spreads have widened considerably in the last two months and then there is the political turmoil read the orange swan hastily crafted policy conflated with politics written on the back of a napkin and delivered by tweet is joining the other risks of declining liquidity and lower economic growth the disruption of the post world war ii world order by the current administration raises market and economic risks in an increasingly flat and interconnected world bottom line never make predictions especially about the future casey stengel i am not arguing whether jay powell s pivot on friday was right or wrong i am arguing that money moves markets leading up to late last week market participants had grown more bearish that helps to explain with the market on the verge of retesting december s lows on thursday why the markets rose with so much vigor in friday s trading session money flows move markets more than any other single independent determinant regardless of the fed s action or inaction on interest rates this year the liquidity risks are growing at the feet of a slowing global economy and amid political turmoil to use john mauldin s term we were living dangerously late last year and that condition likely will continue in 2019 as to the market consequences declining liquidity likely will serve as a governor to the upside and should provide a tailwind to the continued regime of volatility with so many market participants poorly positioned after thursday s schmeissing and with the growing pessimism in investor sentiment i sense some runway toward higher prices over the near term to me a pattern similar to 2011 seems possible by means of background in 2011 the spyders opened the year at 127 rallied to 135 dropped to 117 and closed the year at about the same price they started the year 2019 seen as 2011 a beginning of the year rally an overshoot above my 2400 2500 s p fair market value as the markets are relieved about the fed s more dovish narrative and that powell may not pressure liquidity as much as previously feared a first half retest of the prior lows as it becomes clear that the u s economy will deliver only 1 to 2 real gdp growth another liquidity rally taking us upward at year end where we started 2019 as the specter of qe4 moves closer to reality following a negative gdp print in the third quarter of 2019

asher price asherprice statesman com despite a decline in oil and gas prices texas economy is still growing and its revenue is increasing the state s top accountant said monday comptroller glenn hegar estimated that lawmakers returning to the capitol on tuesday will have as much as 119 1 billion in revenue available for general purpose spending in the 2020 21 budget that s an 8 1 percent increase from the amount available in the current two year budget progressive policy groups say the additional revenue should translate into greater spending on services for everything from cutting lines at driver s license offices to increased subsidies for college education conservatives have suggested the fatter revenues should mean lawmakers cut taxes budget watchers said the revenue estimate numbers tend to be bigger than expected opening the way to a robust legislative session in which a spectrum of factions rally around their causes to corner some of the cash hegar however sounded a note of warning despite this projected revenue growth the legislature will again face some difficult choices in balancing the budget he said listing education spending and property tax cuts as the most pressing and costly budget drivers the increased revenue is largely due to a booming economy that has led to big jumps in sales tax collections as a growing population of texans buy more of everything sales tax revenue makes up the largest source of general revenue related collections about 55 percent and hegar estimated that sales tax revenue will increase 9 5 percent during the coming biennium calling himself cautiously optimistic hegar said we re unlikely to see continued revenue growth at the unusually strong rates we ve seen in recent months oil prices have dropped sharply since october west texas crude was trading at 75 per barrel in early october and dropped below 50 by year s end together oil and natural gas production taxes make up about 9 percent of the state general revenue related tax collections financial markets have demonstrated increased volatility interest rates have been rising and u s trade policy remains uncertain and as the nation s leading export state the texas economy in particular is exposed to potential reductions in international trade his conclusion about a red hot texas economy one that added 365 000 jobs in 2018 we expect continued growth though at a more moderated rate closer to historic averages differing priorities the comptroller s revenue estimate deals only with money over which lawmakers have discretionary control the total amount of available revenue including federal funds that pass through the state and other dedicated revenue streams will be 265 6 billion for 2020 21 hegar s report said the texas house and texas senate are expected to propose budgets in about a week vance ginn senior economist at the conservative texas public policy foundation said he would like to see the legislature prioritize taxpayers in the budget process by using some of the increased revenue to lower property taxes but analysts with the progressive center for public policy priorities said the projected increased revenue gave hope for more money to meet a raft of education and health care needs among other things with costs associated with population growth alone increasing by 2 percent the increased revenue is good news for texans concerned about crowded school classrooms medicaid children s health insurance and retired teachers health insurance said eva deluna castro program director of the think tank s invest in texas team more revenue could even spell shorter wait times for drivers licenses she said the texas department of public safety has asked for hundreds of millions of dollars to improve operations at drivers license offices i hope tax cuts are off the table because we don t have excess money said dick lavine a senior fiscal analyst at the center for public policy priorities but gov greg abbott leaped on hegar s projections to suggest the legislature should look to slow property tax growth even with this strong economic growth texans expect their government to live within its means while funding its priorities he said this session i look forward to working with the legislature to fulfill these expectations by addressing many key issues including school finance reform and limiting the growth of property taxes no financial barriers there are many spending items the legislature must address said dale craymer president of the texas taxpayers and research association including medicaid cost and client growth state employee and teacher pension shortfalls retired teacher health insurance and shoring up the texas tomorrow fund the higher education prepaid tuition program the revenue estimate suggests the state will have sufficient money to address most and perhaps all of these items most certainly the numbers mean this will be a school finance session he said there is enough money in these numbers coupled with revenues from rising local property taxes that there are no financial barriers to addressing how we finance our schools given the demands on the treasury meaningful tax cuts will be difficult cuts that would easily be noticeable though some modest cuts here and there may get some consideration he said how the legislature will handle these and other budget related questions hegar spent part of monday hammering home that he thinks his office should be given more leeway to invest money in the state s so called rainy day fund recently pegged at a record of 12 5 billion will unfold over the next 140 days state rep drew darby r san angelo chairman of the house energy resources committee and a member of the ways and means committee told the american statesman that hegar s estimate supplies the legislature with some options to find solutions and fix problems
xrp the popular yet controversial token issued by the distributed ledger software company ripple has its first official bank endorsement euro exim bank in london the bank is set to announce tuesday that it has embraced xrp and ripple s xrapid software as an answer to the liquidity and visibility problems that arise in sending payments across the globe there s been a lot of talk around the markets about how blockchain technology can assist in trade finance said graham bright head of compliance and operations at the bank we re interested in moving forward and creating a platform for payments for our clients who are in over 80 countries at the moment making sure they have a smooth frictionless way of paying local people currently if a u s bank wants to send a payment to another country it has to keep money on deposit at a nostro account at a correspondent bank in that foreign country the funds in the account are used to settle the payment which is directed by a message sent over the swift network when a bank doesn t have a direct relationship with a bank in another country it uses correspondent banks as intermediaries through which the payment instruction hops ripple is seeking to upend this practice using ripple s xrapid software and xrp and following guidelines set by the software firm banks can send payments across borders without having to store money in accounts in foreign countries instead they can use xrp as a bridge across borders they can use their own local currency say u s dollars to buy xrp then they buy the currency of the foreign country with that xrp and use that to make the payment both parties trust the xrp ledger to cryptographically secure and record the transaction when you use xrp instead of having to pre park all your money in foreign accounts around the world you hold your funds locally under your control your stability your creditworthiness it s a much better position structurally said marcus treacher global head of strategic accounts at ripple you can move funds from your local account brazilian reals for example into the target account euros say in two minutes banks could keep less money locked up in offshore accounts and lower their currency volatility risk he said one ripple customer cuallix is a u s based payment company that sends payments to mexico before it began using ripple s xrapid and xrp model cuallix had to pre book funds in mexican pesos and hold them there days in advance with the fluctuations in value peso to dollar that is a high risk method treacher said now cuallix holds funds onshore in u s dollars why euro exim bank is all in euro exim bank became interested in ripple when some executives were invited to the company s swell conference in san francisco last october we realized the type of companies there were very forward thinking in the innovation they were putting in place bright said we saw the technology would let us easily and quickly originate payments without having bilateral relationships the bank also liked the idea of receiving an audit and record of everything happening on the network that visibility is so important bright said in contrast in an interview on jan 4 he noted that his bank had sent a payment instruction to another bank on dec 29 across the swift network and still didn t know where it was it was lost somewhere in the quagmire of a central organization and we have no visibility on where it is said bright who worked at swift for 20 years all the counterparty says is we ve not received your message another appealing feature is speed ripple says it can process 1 500 transactions per second swift s network is store and forward so transactions can take a day or more to execute in trade finance where large amounts of goods sit at ports while buyers wait for them being able to execute payments within a few minutes will make a big difference in some locations bright said several euro exim bank clients are almost desperate to make sure this can work he said many of the bank s clients need to pay for materials from foreign countries in local currencies and foreign exchange is often a challenge but converting xrp to naira in nigeria or xrp to the malaysian ringgit is easier he said and this method eliminates the need to have intermediary banks each one taking a cut and adding delay euro exim bank plans to start using xrp in cross border payments in the first quarter of this year it hopes to not only be the first bank to use xrp and xrapid in cross border payments but to help other banks take the same path xrp s legal questions it s a bold move given that there are legal questions around xrp even the question what is xrp is hard to answer in most initial coin offerings a company issues tokens that act like securities tiny pieces of the company that you can buy that grow in value as the company prospers utility tokens the right to use the products and services the company is building once they are completed or digital currencies decentralized digital assets that can be used to buy things xrp doesn t neatly fit any of these categories ripple s founders created 100 billion xrp in 2013 at that time the company was called opencoin ripple currently owns just over 60 of xrp and it releases 1 billion xrp a month for sale to grow the team business and ecosystem in december 2017 ripple locked 55 billion xrp into a series of escrows ripple would not say who else owns large chunks of xrp forbes reported last year that co founder and former ceo chris larsen who stepped down in november 2016 and is now executive chairman owns 5 19 billion xrp and has a 17 stake in the company this gave him a net worth at that time of 37 3 billion making him the 15th richest american the publication also said current ripple ceo brad garlinghouse owns a 6 3 stake in ripple and an unspecified number of xrp tokens co founder and former cto of ripple jed mccaleb originally owned 9 billion xrp he left the company in 2013 and in 2014 announced plans to sell off all his xrp after a legal tangle with ripple mccaleb reached an agreement in 2016 to give 2 billion xrp to charity and to put the rest of his 5 3 billion xrp in a custody account at ripple he is allowed to sell a small percentage of his holding each day the issue of who owns and controls ripple and xrp matters to some the swift version of the world may be slow but everybody s got a stake there s a feeling of ownership and control said lex sokolin global director of fintech strategy at autonomous research the issues around who owns ripple equity and who is in ripple s consortium versus who is the billionaire owning most xrp currency and why should they get to take what is essentially a capital markets rent on the financial services system are all questions it s quite complex and it s not all feel good bright however is not concerned about how much control ripple has over xrp in its current form it serves the purpose of the financial community far better he said it s not as open as a bitcoin or ethereum during the past year several xrp investors who took a hit when the price of xrp dropped in early 2018 have sued ripple saying that xrp is a security and the company violated state and federal law by failing to register xrp with the securities and exchange commission before selling it to retail investors ryan coffey a former wells fargo banker who filed a suit may 3 2018 bought 150 xrp in january 2018 at 2 60 and sold them at 1 70 two weeks later all 100 billion of the xrp in existence were created out of thin air by ripple labs at its inception in 2013 he said in his class action suit defendants have since earned massive profits by quietly selling off this xrp to the general public in what is essentially a never ending initial coin offering but ripple maintains that xrp is a commodity ripple holds xrp it s like holding coffee cocoa or copper treacher said we as a company are a very separate animal to the xrp digital asset that s the crux of why it s a commodity it s an asset class it s not a security to sokolin xrp is just the phantom imagination of a lot of people on the internet however he s not concerned about the lawsuits against xrp he reasons that with any investment there s bound to be a portion of people who will sue bright at euro exim bank considers xrp a digital currency that should be regulated by central banks regulation is welcome to bring it to the fore and to make sure it can be transacted like a regular currency he said the lawsuits have also pointed to statements made by ripple company officers including garlinghouse that have conflated xrp with its software and caused xrp to rise in price they say ripple s primary source of revenue is the periodic sale of xrp to investors that the price of xrp is directly tied to ripple s business and operations and that ripple controls the supply of xrp and the ledger on which it is based to some this appears antithetical to the idea of a decentralized currency and the underlying democratic concept of blockchain technology which is supposed to be open to all and controlled by none but asheesh birla senior vice president of product he oversees all of ripple s enterprise software products xcurrent xrapid and xvia counters that the xrp ledger is open and decentralized it uses a consensus mechanism in which 150 validator nodes work together to validate new ledger entries every two to three seconds bitcoin and ethereum use mining to confirm ledger updates according to birla ripple operates seven of the validator nodes and doesn t know who runs the other 143 anyone can run a validator birla said some of the exchanges that list xrp run a validator a lot of our customers have expressed interest in running an xrp validator validators also govern the road map for the xrp ledger he said ripple has consolidated all the existing xrp investor lawsuits which were filed in ripple s home state of california into one case to be tried in a federal court ripple also hired former sec chairman mary jo white and former sec official andrew ceresney to represent it in these suits ripple s trajectory one question that will direct ripple s future is whether or not banks have an incentive to lower the costs of cross border payments getting the international money movement pricing as close to zero as possible is just going to collapse the revenue of the banks in that business line sokolin said but there s also the question of how quickly ripple can build a network effect that could rival swift s ripple has had recent growth spurts last january it forged a partnership with moneygram through which the payment company will test the use of xrp and xrapid in october ripple made xrapid commercially available and announced that mercuryfx cuallix and catalyst corporate credit union had signed up for it in december two kuwait banks also signed on also in october a group of japanese banks launched a domestic payment app using ripple several exchanges began accepting xrp during the course of the year ripple now has more than 200 banks startups and payment companies in the u s brazil europe the middle east north africa and the far east in its ripplenet user network most using xcurrent software to make cross border payments the future of xrp may be uncertain but ripple s software is riding a tide of popularity at least outside the u s that is easy to see

opportunities in this country if you look at the corporate structure the biggest gap is the fact that it s under invested in canada mr bristow said in an interview late last week aurora cannabis inc

the following are prepared remarks by carlos ghosn ex chairman of nissan motor for his court appearance in tokyo on tuesday regarding allegations against him of aggravated breach of trust the statement was released by ghosn s lawyers in the united states i am grateful to finally have the opportunity to speak publicly i look forward to beginning the process of defending myself against the accusations that have been made against me first let me say that i have a genuine love and appreciation for nissan i believe strongly that in all of my efforts on behalf of the company i have acted honourably legally and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company with the sole purpose of supporting and strengthening nissan and helping to restore its place as one of japan s finest and most respected companies now i would like to address the allegations 1 the fx forward contracts when i first joined nissan and moved to japan almost 20 years ago i wanted to be paid in us dollars but was told that that was not possible and was given an employment contract that required me to be paid in japanese yen i have long been concerned about the volatility of the yen relative to the us dollar i am a us dollar based individual my children live in the us and i have strong ties to lebanon whose currency has a fixed exchange rate against the us dollar i wanted predictability in my income in order to help me take care of my family to deal with this issue i entered into foreign exchange contracts throughout my tenure at nissan beginning in 2002 two such contracts are at issue in this proceeding one was signed in 2006 when the nissan stock price was around 1 500 yen and the yen dollar rate was around 118 the other was signed in 2007 when the nissan stock price was around 1 400 yen and the yen dollar exchange rate was around 114 the 2008 2009 financial crisis caused nissan s shares to plummet to 400 yen in october 2008 and to 250 yen in february 2009 down more than 80 per cent from its peak and the yen dollar exchange rate dropped below 80 it was a perfect storm that no one predicted the entire banking system was frozen and the bank asked for an immediate increase in my collateral on the contracts which i could not satisfy on my own the media gathering in front of the tokyo detention center where carlos ghosn the ousted nissan motor chairman is being held in custody on december 21 2018 photo kyodo i was faced with two stark choices 1 resign from nissan so that i could receive my retirement allowance which i could then use to provide the necessary collateral but my moral commitment to nissan would not allow me to step down during that crucial time a captain doesn t jump ship in the middle of a storm 2 ask nissan to temporarily take on the collateral so long as it came to no cost to the company while i gathered collateral from my other sources i chose option 2 the fx contracts were then transferred back to me without nissan incurring any loss 2 khaled juffali khaled juffali has been a long time supporter and partner of nissan during a very difficult period khaled juffali company helped nissan solicit financing and helped nissan solve a complicated problem involving a local distributor indeed juffali helped nissan restructure struggling distributors throughout the gulf region enabling nissan to better compete with rivals like toyota which was outperforming nissan juffali also assisted nissan in negotiating the development of a manufacturing plant in saudi arabia organising high level meetings with saudi officials khaled juffali company was appropriately compensated an amount disclosed to and approved by the appropriate officers at nissan in exchange for these critical services that substantially benefited nissan a packed courtroom at the tokyo district court on tuesday january 8 2019 photo bloomberg 3 the fiel allegations four major companies sought to recruit me while i was ceo of nissan including ford by bill ford and general motors by steve rattner the then car czar under president barack obama even though their proposals were very attractive i could not in good conscience abandon nissan while we were in the midst of our turnaround nissan is an iconic japanese company that i care about deeply although i chose not to pursue the other opportunities i did keep a record of the market compensation for my role which those companies offered me if i had taken these jobs this was an internal benchmark that i kept for my own future reference it had no legal effect it was never shared with the directors and it never represented any kind of binding commitment in fact the various proposals for non compete and advisory services post retirement made by some members of the board did not reflect or reference my internal calculations underscoring their hypothetical non binding nature contrary to the accusations made by the prosecutors i never received any compensation from nissan that was not disclosed nor did i ever enter into any binding contract with nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed moreover i understood that any draft proposals for post retirement compensation were reviewed by internal and external lawyers showing i had no intent to violate the law for me the test is the death test if i died today could my heirs require nissan to pay anything other than my retirement allowance the answer is an unequivocal no photo taken from a kyodo news helicopter shows people lining up near the tokyo district court on january 8 2019 to take part in a ticket draw for the first hearing of former nissan motor s chairman carlos ghosn as many as 1 122 tickets were handed out for the 14 public seats available bloomberg reported photo kyodo 4 contribution to nissan i have dedicated two decades of my life to reviving nissan and building the alliance i worked toward these goals day and night on the earth and in the air standing shoulder to shoulder with hardworking nissan employees around the globe to create value the fruits of our labours have been extraordinary we transformed nissan moving it from a position of a debt of 2 trillion yen us 18 billion in 1999 to cash of 1 8 trillion yen at the end of 2006 from 2 5 million cars sold in 1999 at a significant loss to 5 8 million cars sold profitably in 2016 nissan s asset base tripled during the period people queue outside the tokyo district court to attend the hearing of former nissan chairman carlos ghosn on january 8 2019 as many as 1 122 tickets were handed out for the 14 public seats available bloomberg reported photo jiji press we saw the revival of icons like the fairlady z and nissan g tr nissan s industrial entry into wuhan china st petersburg russia chennai india and resende brazil the pioneering of a mass market for electric cars with the leaf the jump starting of autonomous cars the introduction of mitsubishi motors to the alliance and the alliance becoming the number one auto group in the world in 2017 producing more than 10 million cars annually infographics global carmakers and their venture partners in china we created directly and indirectly countless jobs in japan and re established nissan as a pillar of the japanese economy these accomplishments secured alongside the peerless team of nissan employees worldwide are the greatest joy of my life next to my family 5 conclusion your honour i am innocent of the accusations made against me i have always acted with integrity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in my several decade professional career i have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations thank you your honour for listening to me

a man walks past the day s losses of nikkei stock index left and of the dow jones industrial average right on an electronic stock board at a securities firm in tokyo monday dec 25 2018 president donald trump s attacks on the federal reserve spooked the stock market on christmas eve and efforts by his treasury secretary to calm investors fears only seemed to make matters worse contributing to another day of heavy losses on wall street yohei fukai kyodo news via ap you might say a person is fundamentally healthy so long as you cannot yet say what will cause his death likewise an economic recovery is healthy if it is not clear what will cause the next recession by this standard the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis though disappointingly slow has been healthy for most of the past decade this is now in serious doubt paul samuelson s famous quip that the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions cautions against overreacting to recent market moves but credit spreads have widened considerably commodity prices have softened and investors have started demanding higher yields for short term u s bonds than for those with longer terms unlike equity markets such yield curve inversions have not historically tended to produce false recession predictions the overall judgment of financial markets is that a recession is significantly more likely than not in the next two years real economic indicators for the world s largest economies china and the united states also suggest cause for concern almost every chinese indicator in the past few months has come in below expectations beijing now sees the need for stimulus measures if they are to credibly report the attainment of growth targets revisions of economic forecasts tend to run in the same direction for protracted periods as forecasters adjust to emerging realities this tendency is especially pronounced in china given the extreme political sensitivity of economic statistics in the united states inflation is again running below the federal reserve s 2 percent target and comparisons of the yields on ordinary and inflation adjusted bonds suggest investors expect this to continue for the next decade while jobs growth remains strong employment is usually a lagging statistic forward looking indicators of business and consumer sentiment suggest that growth is likely to slow perhaps the u s economy will enjoy a soft landing jobs growth would slow toward long run sustainable levels and productivity growth would accelerate enough to allow continued gross domestic product growth of 2 percent and increased wage growth without accelerating inflation but this would require both policy skill and great luck given that we are starting from very high debt levels and low unemployment a recession is the more likely outcome it is almost inconceivable that the global economy will remain healthy in the face of serious economic problems in both china and the united states even leaving aside their conflicts over trade and technology europe lacks economic energy and the uncertainties associated with brexit french protests german political transition and italian populism mean the continent is more likely to be a source of problems than a solution like generals fighting the last war too many policymakers are focused on yesterday s problems the global economy is much more likely to suffer from a downturn than from overheating in the next two years there is more likely to be too little credit flow than too much asset price deflation is more probable than a bubble and excess austerity is a bigger risk than profligacy advertisement the critical challenge for monetary and fiscal policy will be to maintain sufficient demand amid immense geopolitical uncertainty increasing protectionism high accumulated debt levels and structural and demographic factors leading to increased private saving and reduced private investment the fed should signal that it is determined to avoid a downturn which would assure another decade of below target inflation the people s bank of china and other central banks should also make clear that they recognize that avoiding another recession is the most important thing they can contribute to financial stability fiscal policymakers should also realize the very low real yield on government bonds is a signal that more debt can be absorbed it is not too soon to begin plans to launch large scale infrastructure projects if a downturn comes the largest economies should try to limit trade frictions and signal that they are committed to cooperating to support global growth by assuring adequate capital flows to emerging markets and avoiding a cycle of protectionism even if my recession fears are excessive a shift toward

good tuesday morning was this email forwarded to you sign up here could venture capitalists make student debt obsolete silicon valley is captivated by a new concept that could eliminate student debt andrew writes in his column students were saddled with 1 5 trillion in debt last year a record high an idea called income share agreements has been talked about for years as a way to alleviate that burden under this system tuition is free but students agree to pay back a percentage of their income for several years if they get good jobs after graduation lambda school an online learning start up founded in 2017 with the backing of y combinator has 30 million in funding today from venture capitalists to make the concept a reality andrew writes the investments will be used to turn lambda which has focused on subjects like coding and data science into a multidisciplinary school offering half year programs in professions where there is significant hiring demand like nursing and cybersecurity it s an expansion that could be a precursor to lambda becoming a full scale university the lambda model is being closely watched it s meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows and potentially lift their crippling debt load
dr patrick njoroge his performance at cbk has been above board and could earn him another term nairobi kenya the new year could see a facelift of leading veteran industry captains as their terms come to an end whether they will leave or have their terms renewed will depend on the specific institutions they work for and how they posture their success at the helm their political connections networks as well as and expediency could also weigh in as final determinants as to whether they will still hold the corner office in june the changes will test the central bank of kenya cbk leadership where both the governor dr patrick njoroge and his deputy sheila mmbijewe have come to the end of their four year tenure the wave of change may also sweep to the taxman s doorstep where the commissioner general john njiraini whose term had ended but got a rare extension the term of communication authority of kenya ca francis wangusi comes to an end in june this year more than a year after the die was cast for his exit when he survived by a breath of hair in january the rural electrification authority has also been in limbo since the expiry of its chairman simon gicharu in june this year last year the ethics and anti corruption commission s chief executive position fell vacant following the expiry of mr halakhe waqo s six year non renewable contract he is to be replaced by twalib abdallah mbarak in the corporate world safaricom chief executive bob collymore s extended tenure ends august 2019 after his contract was extended in 2017 for two years this also applies to kenya airways chief executive sebastian mikosz s contract is set to run out this year if the airline does not renew his contract for the cbk the first tenure has been tumultuous dr njoroge refused to give his opinion of what he thinks is his legacy and whether he will be viewed favourably by president uhuru kenyatta when his time comes at the helm of the bank of last resort there is no legacy here hapa ni kazi tu dr njoroge said in his last monetary policy committee mpc press briefing in 2018 his choice of quote is curiously drawn from tanzania s president john magufuli whose tagline and public press ups drew him popularity but has since turned authoritarian and abrasive could the same be said of kenya s cbk boss endeared for his international monetary fund background celibacy and lack of interest in worldly wealth psychological mark his first tenure can be gauged at face value where he has managed to keep the shilling below the psychological mark of 107 units against the dollar in october 2011 that gave shade to his predecessor prof njuguna ndungu s career dr njoroge has also been able to change the image on the currency albeit coins with notes printing cleared by the court of appeal expected to follow soon the governor has also kept inflation in check relatively and with the help of government subsidies managed to rope inflation down when it slipped to 11 7 per cent in may following the drought for the rogue industry the cbk governor approached it with the meekness of a monk unimpressed by bribery and the strong arm of the law this led to the closure of three lenders in tow imperial bank chase bank and dubai bank but does he regret the move three years down the line depositors have only been able to get a fraction of their money taking away the grace of historical record of brokering the first carve out a deal he promised hell and brimstone for the bandits who brought the lenders down instead they have proven tenacious in waiting him out there is a high chance of his return and possibly pursuing them through the myriad of court cases tied up like a yarn his currency stability has essentially allowed the government to continue borrowing without exposure to currency risk and has earned him an applause from president uhuru kenyatta thanks to your hard work and commitment our shilling has remained stable and competitive president uhuru kenyatta said during the launch of the new coinage while commenting on cbk s freedom president kenyatta insisted on operational independence but added that inherently the institution must cooperate with the executive however his deputy dr sheila mmbijewe may not be as lucky she has attained retirement age clocking 60 years the cbk deputy governor a kenyan was born on march 6 1958 in kampala uganda the london trained accountant stayed put because the bank of last resort is operating with only one deputy in disregard to provisions to have two deputies according to central bank of kenya act cap 491 section 13b 1 dr mmbijewe seen as a direct hand of the house on the hill in the money printing fortitude and powerful behind the scenes as an enforcer of the shilling stability may only be saved if mr kenyatta can convince parliament that she has special scarce skills retirement age is 60 in public service however one can work on contract with approval of the board and cabinet secretary after 60 if they have specialised scarce skills former public service commission chairperson margaret kobia now cabinet secretary for public service youth and gender affairs said in february 2016 kra boss john njiraini but perhaps the state official who has defied the age rule trounced his own board fought a nail biting court battle brushed shoulders with the ombudsman over involvement in politics and still managed to keep his job is mr njiraini even the auditor general edward ouko said the kra boss was in office illegally in his audit report as of june 30 2017 born in 1957 according to official records mr njiraini has already overstayed his welcome but soldiered on with blessings of the highest office the former institute of certified public accountants of kenya boss rose to the post of commissioner for domestic taxes and large taxpayers in 2006 when the kra commissioner general michael waweru bowed out in 2012 president uhuru kenyatta was then minister of finance in 2015 the board renewed mr njiraini s contract for a three year term which and was supposed to end on march 4 2018 this came three months after he hit the retirement age of 60 last in december 2017 then the intrigues started and the board gave him two months notice which was to see him leave by july 2018 in spite of a one year extension granted in march this attempt fell flat on its face after president kenyatta intervened and kicked out the board chaired by dr edward sambili and included evans kakai ms constance kandie rashid ali and abdi barre duale activist okiya omtatah also fell apart after the courts ruled that mr njiraini was on a fixed term contract which is permissible under section 80 2 of the psc act that was exempt from the age limit he had sidestepped the ombudsman s accusations of directly taking part in politics contrary to public officers ethics act when he attended a fundraising party of the friends of jubilee famed for raising sh15 million in record five minutes francis wangusi fought to remain at communications authority of kenya but while some state bosses found the privileges and benefits of their offices too sweet to leave one francis wangusi has had to fight on to even finish his term mr wangusi had headed the ca since 2012 he was re appointed the director general of the authority for a four year term effective august 22 2015 but early 2018 he was kicked out for the long serving boss wangusi had brushed shoulders with the powerful dined with some and stepped on the feet of some and when his day of reckoning came they came shooting in all directions while he was accused of malpractices in staff training and promotions at the telco regulator underlying issues cropped up airtel had won a sh2 billion license battle against ca and the national treasury and his tenure was also bogged by controversy for awarding jamii telecoms a tier two telecommunications operators of the faiba brand a license and coveted spectrum to operate another mobile phone service for just sh100 000 the fight that boiled over eventually roped in the tug between ca and the ict ministry headed by joseph mucheru and former broadcasting and telecoms principal secretary sammy itemere the battles including the fight over the funding of ajira digital programme the creation of the department of cyber security and e commerce and sh25 million to fund president kenyatta s swearing in ceremony were laid bare in court as the state aired its dirty linen in public he also linked his problems to the controversial competition study in the telecommunications industry a feat he has turned to as a definition of his legacy mr wangusi went to court and successfully quashed his suspension reaching an out of court settlement with the board that will see him live out his full term that expires in august this year in an exclusive interview with the standard following his surprise suspension mr wangusi said he would revisit the jamii telecom license issues before leaving office the ca has clarified saying the licence granted to jamii was a one year trial one and not an operating permit however the communications regulator granted the operator a year s extension with the licence now expiring in march 2019 meaning jamii telecom will now have to pay the sh2 billion spectrum fees if they are to roll out services another key item on mr wagusi s agenda on his last months in office and one that caused him untold headaches in his final years is the protracted report on dominance in the telecommunications and broadcasting sector ca commissioned uk firm analysys mason to carry out the multi million study that would drastically change the regulatory environment bringing market leader safaricom under fresh scrutiny by virtue of its market size the report was due for publishing and adoption last year it remains to be seen the final tricks mr wangusi has saved up his sleeve former safaricom boss michael joseph is also set to leave kenya airways after stewarding its board when the airline crossed the atlantic and landed in america together with the airline s polish boss mikosz kq has focused on cutting expenses including overheads and fleet ownership costs mikosz s term will also come up for review in 2019 according to the company s annual report

you might say a person is fundamentally healthy so long as you cannot yet say what will cause his death likewise an economic recovery is healthy if it is not clear what will cause the next recession by this standard the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis though disappointingly slow has been healthy for most of the past decade this is now in serious doubt paul samuelson s famous quip that the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions cautions against overreacting to recent market moves but credit spreads have widened considerably commodity prices have softened and investors have started demanding higher yields for short term u s bonds than for those with longer terms unlike equity markets such yield curve inversions have not historically tended to produce false recession predictions the overall judgment of financial markets is that a recession is significantly more likely than not in the next two years real economic indicators for the world s largest economies china and the united states also suggest cause for concern almost every chinese indicator in the past few months has come in below expectations beijing now sees the need for stimulus measures if they are to credibly report the attainment of growth targets revisions of economic forecasts tend to run in the same direction for protracted periods as forecasters adjust to emerging realities this tendency is especially pronounced in china given the extreme political sensitivity of economic statistics in the united states inflation is again running below the federal reserve s 2 percent target and comparisons of the yields on ordinary and inflation adjusted bonds suggest investors expect this to continue for the next decade while jobs growth remains strong employment is usually a lagging statistic forward looking indicators of business and consumer sentiment suggest that growth is likely to slow perhaps the u s economy will enjoy a soft landing jobs growth would slow toward long run sustainable levels and productivity growth would accelerate enough to allow continued gross domestic product growth of 2 percent and increased wage growth without accelerating inflation but this would require both policy skill and great luck given that we are starting from very high debt levels and low unemployment a recession is the more likely outcome it is almost inconceivable that the global economy will remain healthy in the face of serious economic problems in both china and the united states even leaving aside their conflicts over trade and technology europe lacks economic energy and the uncertainties associated with brexit french protests german political transition and italian populism mean the continent is more likely to be a source of problems than a solution like generals fighting the last war too many policymakers are focused on yesterday s problems the global economy is much more likely to suffer from a downturn than from overheating in the next two years there is more likely to be too little credit flow than too much asset price deflation is more probable than a bubble and excess austerity is a bigger risk than profligacy the critical challenge for monetary and fiscal policy will be to maintain sufficient demand amid immense geopolitical uncertainty increasing protectionism high accumulated debt levels and structural and demographic factors leading to increased private saving and reduced private investment the fed should signal that it is determined to avoid a downturn which would assure another decade of below target inflation the people s bank of china and other central banks should also make clear that they recognize that avoiding another recession is the most important thing they can contribute to financial stability fiscal policymakers should also realize the very low real yield on government bonds is a signal that more debt can be absorbed it is not too soon to begin plans to launch large scale infrastructure projects if a downturn comes the largest economies should try to limit trade frictions and signal that they are committed to cooperating to support global growth by assuring adequate capital flows to emerging markets and avoiding a cycle of protectionism even if my recession fears are excessive a shift toward emphasizing growth will contribute to bringing inflation up to target levels and can be reversed if i am proved right the costs of delay in the policy response could be catastrophic it is the irony of our moment that prudence requires the rejection of austerity summers is a professor at and past president of harvard university he was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to president barack obama from 2009 through 2010
andriy kravchenko 123rf stock photo it s easy to despair when reading dismal economic headlines listen to the full podcast on advisortogo powered by cibc if it s not the fed then it s trade wars it s brexit italy oil prices every day there appears to be some overhang that investors become convinced will end the economic cycle said paul roukis managing director and portfolio manager at rothschild asset management in new york during a december 2018 interview investors are also concerned about the two and 10 year u s treasury spread which fell to its lowest point in a decade 0 11 twice in december the spread closed at 0 17 on jan 3 based on past cycles would inspire talk of an economic slowdown and a moderation in inflationary pressures said roukis whose firm manages the renaissance u s equity value fund economists have found that when the spread goes negative and the yield curve inverts a recession usually follows roukis pointed out that in early october investors were concerned about the exact opposite rising inflation we ve gone from the concept that the fed is behind the curve to one where they ve already tightened too much in just a few short weeks he said time will tell if the pendulum swung too far roukis acknowledged there are two near term threats to the u s equity market but said both are manageable the first is inflation after years of accommodative policies by the fed interest rates are generally trending higher in the u s notwithstanding recent moves as we ve seen higher rates reintroduce friction into financial markets and the economy if the fed needs to hike beyond market expectations he says that would create headwinds fortunately the general inflationary backdrop remains benign which should be good for stocks he said in a perfect world measured rate hikes would continue in 2019 supported by strong domestic economic growth trends and controlled inflation since early december the fed seems to be adopting a more flexible approach to its tightening policies said roukis in follow up comments jan 4 he added that as of friday most signs particularly employment continue to point to a healthy economic backdrop for 2019 however there are tangible signs of an economic slowdown in certain overseas markets which bear watching investors found out friday that the u s added 312 000 jobs in december much higher than the average 217 000 per month for all of 2018 wages rose as well the cme fedwatch tool which is based on fed fund futures shows that a rate pause is most probable for 2019 however friday s positive job numbers led to some traders predicting a hike as early as the may meeting previously there was a small probability starting in june roukis s second threat to u s equities is what he calls trade friction trade is interconnected and it s complex supply chains were established over decades and built on the foundation of comparative advantage it s truly difficult to quantify what the impact will be if trade barriers get erected but a likely consequence could be higher inflation goods would likely cost more to the end consumer reasons stocks could rise corporate profits ultimately drive stock returns said roukis he said 2018 would likely be one of the strongest years on record for profit growth with expectations of around 25 from a historical perspective this level of growth is unusual from what most investors would assume is the mature part of the cycle such growth is more consistent with the early stages of recovery he added roukis said that growth was supported by about 8 revenue growth improved operating margins tax reform and capital management in particular share buybacks as such he attributed the late 2018 selloff to a readjustment of 2019 earnings growth expectations analyst estimates of profitability have moderated a bit that said for the s p 500 the consensus earnings per share is roughly in the mid 170s at this point the assumptions underlying the consensus are not herculean going forward revenue growth assumptions of 5 or so seem reasonable considering that foreign economies are slowing the u s dollar is strengthening and the u s housing market is weakening said roukis further 2019 expectations seem to assume very modest or stable operating margin numbers just given rising input costs related to wages and supply costs we ve seen some moderation in pressures in recent months which could help margins in coming quarters relative to expectations a final positive companies have cash in addition to raising dividends they re on target to repurchase over 700 billion in common stock in 2018 and that number likely increases in 2019 barring unusual circumstances that could boost eps by a few percentage points he said as such roukis said he s cautiously optimistic we re entering 2019 with reasonable earnings expectations by investors with decelerating growth trends appropriately implied in assumptions this article is part of the

columns staff writer daily commercial 2018 likely will be remembered for achieving solid economic growth a highly volatile stock market and an emerging trade war with china in 2019 we can expect slower growth continued volatility and china to resist significant market based reforms these and other factors combined with an environment of political uncertainty could create greater risks the u s economy is estimated to have grown by 3 percent in 2018 this rate is based on various components including strong retail and construction sectors and a real estate market that has slowed due to a housing shortage rising mortgage rates and high home prices which have kept some buyers on the curb and consumer spending which represents 70 percent of u s output is reflected in relatively strong but slightly decreasing consumer confidence says the conference board a u s think tank the labor market is another issue that has real impact the exceptionally low unemployment rate has been good for workers but it has contributed to a labor and skills deficit that s not good for businesses struggling to find them consequently there are more than 7 million non farm job openings that have not been filled according to the bureau of labor statistics many industries including manufacturing construction and trucking are experiencing the largest labor shortages in decades if companies can t find the employees and skills they need they can t grow resulting in downward pressure on economic growth but one of the biggest factors that will impact the u s economy in 2019 is international trade although the changes are minimal and likely to lead to higher priced automobiles the united states mexico canada agreement known as usmca if passed by congress essentially resulting in a modified nafta will help to reduce uncertainty and market volatility and the likelihood that the u s and european union can reach a favorable trade agreement in 2019 will be another step in the right direction but trying to get china to comply with all the demands made by president trump will be unlikely by march 1 the end of the 90 day trade truce agreed to by trump and chinese president xi at the g20 meeting in buenos aires on dec 1 and here s why for decades china has been subsidizing its state owned enterprises thereby giving then an unfair competitive advantage pressuring u s companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access and placing market restrictions on u s companies in addition enforcement of chinese intellectual property protection laws have been weak resulting in lost profits for american firms to adequately address many of these concerns as well as achieve higher levels of sustainable economic growth china needs to press ahead with many market based economic reforms it agreed to implement when it joined the world trade organization in december 2001 but the speed at which this might occur if at all could have positive or negative consequences for example beijing should eliminate subsidies from its 100 000 state owned enterprises many of which underperform and put a drag on its economy but to do so too quickly could cause unemployment and social unrest to rise something feared by the ruling communist party on the other hand reforms initiated slowly that in the long run would alleviate trade tensions may not satisfy the white house timetable how trump perceives china s offer in march and presents it to his base will determine if it is a win for the administration or a reason to ratchet up the trade war that could turn into a cold war and the latter would generate greater uncertainty and volatility the enemy of prosperity in turn american investors and consumers would be inclined to spend less putting downward pressure on u s economic growth the federal reserve and the wall street journal s economic forecasting survey predict the u s growth rate will decline to 2 3 percent in 2019 this is based on metrics we can see and analyze but it s the direction of u s china trade and relations political uncertainty volatility in the stock market or a combination of factors that could create new risks affecting the economy as a result 2019 will require american consumers households businesses and investors to operate very cautiously john manzella founder of the manzellareport com is an author and speaker on global business emerging risks and economic trends to contact john visit www johnmanzella com

by itself us qt would hit asset prices but not necessarily produce an output recession however the us has also raised short interest rates and flattened the yield curve as short rates have risen up to long rates that is combined with the end of budgetary stimulus in the us so us policy is now aggressively tightening if short rates rise above long rates on past history this threatens a us recession credit squeeze monetary policy is driving sharemarket falls not trade wars us government shutdowns brexit or oil prices these other factors increase market volatility given the backdrop of tightening monetary policy but they are not the fundamental drivers we may get rallies if individual problems are dealt with but if monetary policy keeps tightening there are further sharemarket falls ahead and the risk of recession rises the us market is no longer pricing in further rises in us interest rates despite the fed suggesting they are likely the fed has just backed off the claim that qt was on autopilot the fed still thinks further monetary tightening is likely but has made it data dependent to the relief of markets the chances of getting it wrong are high continued qt will push the us dollar higher and create problems for emerging countries that have borrowed in us dollars and thus face higher repayments in domestic currency as turkey argentina south africa and others have discovered advertisement australia is in a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on the conditions on which they will lend in response to regulatory changes and the banking royal commission australian interest rates generally have not risen but credit is harder to get and the forced switch from interest only housing loans to interest and principal repayments is having a major impact on households cash flow house prices have further to fall particularly if labor wins government and can get its proposed tax changes through the senate falling share and house prices here will hit consumption and slow economic growth this year consumption spending has been growing faster than incomes for some time household saving has collapsed as consumers were prepared to save less out of current income while their wealth was rising the reserve bank thinks wealth is not an important factor in driving consumption we will soon find out i expect domestic spending to slow in 2019 as households cut back and the key for australia will be whether china can restart its economy fast enough to boost our exports and cushion the slowdown in our economy china relaxed policy through 2018 and is now keen to come to a deal on trade with the united states to avoid an extended slowdown a pick up in china is vital if australia is to avoid real problems running into 2020 as our domestic spending and the world economy slows so it is a time for investor caution and deft policy we are in uncharted waters as global qe turns into qt it could well get ugly if falling asset prices and slower global output growth turn politics nasty there are a lot of elections globally in the next two years where voters could turn to the extremes if economic conditions deteriorate sharply dr ed shann is an independent economist
