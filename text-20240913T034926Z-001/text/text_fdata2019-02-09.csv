heritage and universal values references today modern transportation telecommunications and digital networks have shrunk geographies and eliminated boundaries that had stood for thousands of years the world has become smaller and the number of interactions and exchanges between countries is unprecedented this strengthening of global collaboration is a natural result of technological development the expansion of production and migration this kind of globalization is the result of a natural historical process however there is another kind of globalization and it is the result of communist ideologies hijacking the natural process in order to undermine humanity we will address this second form beginning with the renaissance human history entered a period of dramatic change in the late eighteenth century the industrial revolution greatly increased productivity which spurred social upheaval as well as profound shifts in philosophy and spirituality as technology advanced materialist and atheistic ideas became prominent increasing numbers of people rejected traditional morality and belief in the divine against this historical backdrop the specter of communism has turned globalization into a powerful tool for its goal of separating people from their traditional cultures and faiths while globalization provides opportunities for international cooperation and understanding the breakdown of boundaries between nations and economies allows the specter to combine the worst aspects of both the communist and non communist systems pursuing broad political and cultural operations to further its agenda around the world the globalized economic and financial system facilitates this process making it even harder for individual communities and nations to resist the communist specter s onslaught this book has stressed that communism is not merely a theory but an evil specter it is alive and in pursuing its ultimate goal to destroy humankind it is capable of nearly any kind of mutation that helps it sustain and expand itself since the 1990s globalization ostensibly has been about furthering democracy the market economy and free trade and has therefore met with opposition from a number of left wing groups and figures but these individuals don t realize that it is actually the communist specter operating on another plane communism s aim isn t to use globalization to create a better world but to take over the world by imposing an ideology of globalist control on all the world s nations globalism has made astounding progress on a variety of fronts particularly in the economic political and cultural spheres as an ideological force globalism has many faces and manifests in diverse even superficially contradictory forms often eliciting nebulous feelings of a world free from war poverty discrimination or exploitation but in practice the methods proposed to achieve these things are essentially similar to the utopian lies of communist revolution though each nation has its own culture and history their diverse traditions contain universal moral values common to all of humankind national sovereignty and the cultural traditions of each ethnic group play an important role in national heritage and self determination and offer collective protection in the face of various threats from natural disasters to military invasions additionally an ethnic group s national legends and religious faith help the entire people maintain a sense of identity and protect them from falling for the specter s evil designs while globalists often claim to stand for the cultures of all ethnicities in recent years it has become increasingly apparent that this ideology actually serves to strengthen leftist causes instead of supporting traditional culture which is rooted in faith and virtue globalist talking points tend to mirror the left s political correctness social justice value neutrality and absolute egalitarianism establishing a world government starting with increased supranational bodies and regulation is the main end goal of globalism the formation of a global super government would bring communism within striking distance of achieving its goals to eliminate private property rights sovereign states distinctive races and the traditional culture of each nation 1 globalism and communism karl marx did not mention the concept of globalism in his writings but instead used the term world history which has similar connotations in the communist manifesto marx and co author friedrich engels claimed that the global expansion of capitalism would inevitably produce a huge proletariat working class in the industrialized nations and that a proletarian revolution soon would sweep the globe overthrowing capitalism and achieving the paradise of communism marx and engels also wrote the proletariat can thus only exist world historically just as communism its activity can only have a world historical existence that is to say the realization of communism depends on the proletariat taking joint action around the world the communist revolution must be a global movement later vladimir lenin modified marx s doctrine and proposed that the world revolution could be initiated in russia despite the predominantly rural character of its society at the time in 1919 the soviet communists established the communist international in moscow with branches spread throughout more than sixty countries lenin said that the goal of the communist international was to establish a world soviet republic confuse disorganize and destroy the forces of capitalism around the world bring all nations together into a single world system of economy force the advanced countries to pour prolonged financial aid into the underdeveloped countries divide the world into regional groups as a transitional stage toward total world government populations will more readily abandon their national loyalties to a vague regional loyalty than they will for a world authority later the regionals can be brought all the way into a single world dictatorship of the proletariat william z foster the former national chairman of the communist party usa wrote a communist world will be a unified organized world the economic system will be one great organization based upon the principle of planning now dawning in the ussr the american soviet government will be an important section in this world government joseph stalin the soviet leader who succeeded lenin was known for the temporary policy of socialism in one country but proposed several goals of the communist global revolution in his book marxism and the national question american thinker g edward griffin summarized stalin s points as follows william z foster the former national chairman of the communist party usa wrote a communist world will be a unified organized world the economic system will be one great organization based upon the principle of planning now dawning in the ussr the american soviet government will be an important section in this world government from the actions of marx lenin stalin and foster to the community of human destiny proposed by the leadership of communist china it may be seen that communists are not satisfied with wielding power in just a few countries communism in all its forms is bent on world domination the proletarian world revolution failed to take place in the form marx envisioned what he thought were desperate and dying capitalist societies were instead prosperous and flourishing thanks to the institutions of private ownership and rule of law with the collapse of the soviet and eastern european communist camp and the adoption of market principles by the chinese communist party it appeared that the free world had triumphed over communism but the communist specter hides behind various doctrines and movements as it corrodes infiltrates and expands communist elements into every corner of the world socialism the primary stage of communism has been gaining currency internationally piggybacking on the destabilizing aspects brought about by globalization and globalist factors after world war ii the left wing forces in european countries continued to grow the socialist international which advocated democratic socialism included political parties from more than one hundred countries these parties were in power in various countries and spread across most of europe driving policies of generous welfare high taxation and increased state ownership globalization has hollowed out us industry shrunk the middle class caused incomes to stagnate polarized the rich and the poor and driven rifts in society this has greatly aided the growth in popularity of the left and socialism in the united states and shifted the global political spectrum sharply left in the last decade or so left wing forces foster anti globalization sentiment pinning the blame for the world s ills on capitalism and advocating socialist policies after the cold war anti traditional trends infiltrated the development of economic globalization with the goal of undermining the sovereignty of each country s economic foundations human greed once contained and managed within communities was internationalized and thus became a powerful global force in the last few decades western financial powers shifted wealth accumulated by society over several hundred years to quickly build up the economy of mainland china following the ccp s market reforms the ccp used these investments to prop up its regime while binding foreign businesses and leaders to its corrupt system as the head of the communist forces in the world today the ccp aims to build up a socialist economic superpower while fortifying left wing and communist parties around the world its totalitarian system upended the rules of normal trade and it intends to use the enrichment it gained from democratic free markets to co opt and subvert them from within the ccp s economic strength has also spurred on its political and military ambitions as it attempts to export its authoritarian communist model throughout the world looking at the ccp s globalized strategy from the perspective of marx lenin and stalin today s world has many of the conditions necessary for communist revolution 2 economic globalization economic globalization refers to the integration of chains of global capital production and trade that began in the 1940s and 1950s matured in the 1970s and 1980s and became a global norm in the 1990s international agencies and corporations were the driving forces as they demanded the loosening of regulation and controls to allow the free flow of capital and goods on the surface economic globalization was promoted by western countries to spread capitalism around the world unfortunately however globalization has become a vehicle for the communist specter in particular globalization has resulted in western countries providing financial support to the chinese regime creating a mutual dependency between the capitalist market economy and the ccp s socialist totalitarian economy in exchange for economic benefits the west sacrifices its conscience and universal values while the communist regime expands its control by way of economic coercion a the destabilizing effects of globalization large international organizations treaties and regulations have been formed in the process of globalization particularly the globalization of national economies on the surface this appears to be about the expansion of capitalism and the free market but in fact the trend works toward a unified system of economic control one that is able to issue orders to determine the fate of enterprises in many countries after this international financial order was established the trend of developed countries giving long term economic aid to developing countries was also formed in line with stalin s third goal mentioned previously in terms of handing out financial aid international financial organizations such as the world bank usually implement macroeconomic interventionism which is not only authoritarian but also undermines the free market it also ignores the social cultural and historical conditions of the recipient country the result is diminished freedom and national sovereignty as well as greater centralized economic control american scholar james bovard wrote that the world bank has greatly promoted the nationalization of third world economies and has increased political and bureaucratic control over the lives of the poorest of the poor economic globalization has also contributed to the development of a homogeneous global culture leading to broad uniformity in consumer trends and unified mechanisms of production and consumption many small businesses and those associated with local ethnic groups have simply been wiped out by the wave of globalization more and more people have lost the environment or incentives to freely engage in commerce within their own borders as advances in communications and travel made the world more interconnected it seemed as if globalization would deliver financial prosperity and democratic values to the entire global village in many cases the opposite has occurred developing countries become part of a global production chain which leads to the weakening of their economic sovereignty and in some cases to state failure some countries become burdened with debt and the need to meet repayments fundamentally rupturing the foundation of free capitalist economics in those countries globalization weakens developing countries in other ways as well in the early 2000s jamaica opened its markets and began importing large quantities of cheap milk this made milk more affordable for more people but it also led local dairy farmers to go bankrupt as they couldn t compete amid the flood of cheap imports mexico used to have numerous light industrial manufacturing plants but after beijing gained admittance to the world trade organization wto most of those jobs moved to china which could outcompete mexico in sheer industrial capacity and labor costs during the 1997 asian financial crisis thailand opened its weak financial system to international investment which brought temporary prosperity but when foreign investment left thailand s economy ground to a halt its neighboring countries were also negatively impacted in many developing countries with abundant natural resources foreign investment has poured in but very little economic gain has been generated for locals globalization claims to bring democracy to developing nations but in reality it has empowered corrupt officials while the general public has been left to starve as professor dani rodrik of harvard s john f kennedy school of government stated globalization presents a trilemma we cannot simultaneously pursue democracy national determination and economic globalization this is the fatal flaw of globalization and is a trait easily exploited by communism the benefits and opportunities brought about by globalization have often been limited to a small number of elites in many countries globalization has worsened inequality with seemingly no long term solutions available b how globalization facilitates the spread of communist ideology the communist ideology of egalitarianism and the ethos of struggle have ridden around the world on the back of globalization it eroded national sovereignty exacerbated regional turmoil and heightened the archetypal marxist conflicts between the oppressor and the oppressed that leftists use as ideological weapons to fight against the free market private property and other aspects of the old society the polarization of the rich and the poor created by globalization generates a self perpetuating cycle in western countries the enormous outflow of jobs and entire industries turned the lower and middle classes into victims of globalization in the united states the massive outflow of capital and technology to the people s republic of china prc caused millions of manufacturing job losses leading to the loss of industries and a rise in unemployment from 2000 to 2011 sixty five thousand factories were closed and 5 7 million or 33 percent of manufacturing jobs were lost the gap between rich and poor has been widening in the united states for decades over the past thirty years the growth of the average wage adjusted for inflation has been slowing bringing about the emergence of the working poor those who work or seek jobs for twenty seven weeks of the year but whose income is below the official poverty level in 2016 7 6 million americans were counted among the working poor this polarization provides fertile ground for communist and left wing movements economic problems impact every aspect of society but the demand for a solution based on a perceived unfair distribution of income has led to a surge of socialist ideology and of activism for social justice meanwhile the expansion of social welfare benefits has in turn created more poor families generating a vicious cycle of decreased productivity and individual reliance on the state since 2000 leftist ideology has grown increasingly influential in the united states with youth shifting increasingly to the left on social economic and political issues by the 2016 election a rising demand for socialism was evident along with increasing political polarization to a great extent the impact of globalization lay behind these shifts at the same time the greater the economic and social strife western democratic societies appeared to be suffering from the more triumphant the force of communism appeared on the world stage without compunction the communist specter plays both sides of an issue to achieve its aims thus along with the advance of globalization came anti globalization campaigns marked first by the large scale violent protests in late 1999 in seattle against the wto ministerial conference three large scale international conferences in 2001 the summit of the americas meeting in québec canada the european union summit in gothenburg sweden and the group of eight economic summit in genoa italy were also beset by such demonstrations worldwide anti globalization campaigns have drawn participants from a variety of backgrounds a vast majority of them have been left wing opponents of capitalism writ large including labor unions and environmental organizations as well as victims of globalization and the underprivileged as a result the public whether supporters or opponents of globalization have ended up inadvertently serving the goals of communism c western capitalism nourishing the chinese communist party when assessing the successes of globalization scholars often cite the prc which rapidly came to the fore as the world s second largest economy many predicted that china would ultimately replace the united states as the world s largest economy whereas mexico for example established low end manufacturing as its model the prc set out to obtain the most cutting edge technology from the west and then replace its competitors to that end companies from developed countries were required to set up joint ventures with chinese companies in order to sell into the china market which the ccp then used to extract key technologies the party adopted numerous methods from forcing technology transfers to outright stealing via hacking after obtaining this advanced technology the prc pressed its advantage to dump low priced products on the world market with the help of export rebates and subsidies mainland china defeated competitors with below market prices and disrupted the order of free markets while most developing countries opened their domestic markets the ccp created multiple trade barriers to foreign firms operating in or trading with china however the ccp profited enormously by taking advantage of the wto s rules upon admission in 2001 and simultaneously took advantage of the global market to dump chinese products abroad the party failed to open key industries including telecommunications banking and energy which in turn enabled mainland china to take advantage of the global economy while reneging on its commitments bought off by economic profits the western world turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to the egregious human rights abuses the ccp was committing and the international community continued to confer generous favor on the regime in the midst of globalization the powerful chinese communist regime together with a morally corrupt chinese society has struck a blow to the market economy and trade regulations in the west the prc has ignored the rules and reaped all the advantages of globalization in a sense globalization has been like a blood transfusion for the communist party allowing a fading communist state to spring back into action behind the manipulation of globalization is the hidden purpose of propping up the ccp through the reallocation of wealth globalization has been a process of saving the ccp and giving it renewed political legitimacy while the party strengthened its socialist muscles with capitalist nutrients the west fell into relative decline further giving the ccp confidence in its communist totalitarianism and global ambitions mainland china s rise also greatly excited numerous socialists and members of the left worldwide while its economy has grown the prc has intensified efforts to infiltrate global economic organizations including the wto the international monetary fund the world bank the un industrial development organization and others when assigned to important positions in these organizations chinese officials persuade them to cooperate with the regime in order to endorse the party s schemes and defend its policies the ccp regime uses international economic organizations to carry out its own economic agenda and corporatist model if its ambitions aren t halted the economic and political consequences awaiting the world will be disastrous 3 political globalization political aspects of globalization include increased cooperation among states the emergence of international bodies and the formulation of international agendas and treaties following the emergence of such international institutions as well as rules and regulations that transcend national borders these organizations have developed into bases of international power weakening national sovereignty and eroding the cultural social and moral foundations of individual nations in the name of promoting world peace and international understanding globalist institutions aim to consolidate power for the gradual advancement of the communist program the communist specter promotes and uses international organizations to bolster the strength of leftist factors promoting the marxist philosophy of struggle and communist regimes twisted definitions of human rights and freedom globalism promotes socialist ideas on a global scale including attempts to redistribute wealth and form a world government to eventually bring all of humanity under totalitarian rule a expanding communist political power through the un the united nations the largest international organization was established after world war ii to strengthen cooperation and coordination among countries as a supranational entity the un has been used by communist forces in their goal of weakening and abolishing nation states from its establishment the un was compromised by the soviet led communist bloc and it has served as a tool to advance the interests of communist regimes when the un was founded and its charter drafted the soviet union was one of the sponsoring countries and a permanent member of the security council playing a decisive role the secretary general of the 1945 un conference on international organization was alger hiss a us state department official and important adviser to president franklin d roosevelt less than five years later hiss was convicted of perjury in connection with the charge of being a soviet spy the un charter and conventions contain back doors that are beneficial to communist regimes which likely has a great deal to do with hiss s involvement these conventions have been used to directly or indirectly promote communist ideas and expand communist power the heads of many important un agencies are communists or fellow travelers a number of secretaries general have been socialists and marxists for example the first trygve lie was a norwegian socialist who initially received strong support from the soviet union his most important task was to advocate for bringing the prc into the united nations his successor dag hammarskjöld of sweden was a socialist and a sympathizer for a global communist revolution hammarskjöld often fawned over high ranking ccp official zhou enlai the third secretary general u thant of burma also known as myanmar was a marxist who believed that lenin s ideals were consistent with the un charter the sixth secretary general boutros boutros ghali of egypt began his political career in the regime of gamal abdel nasser and was formerly the vice president of the socialist international considering this it s easy to understand why the heads of communist regimes regularly receive the highest courtesy from the united nations the highest mission of the un is to maintain world peace and security its peacekeeping forces are overseen by the under secretary general for political and peacebuilding affairs of the fourteen individuals who held this position from 1946 to 1992 thirteen were soviet citizens though the soviet union used safeguarding world peace as its slogan the regime never relinquished its attempt to expand communist power and it had no interest in contributing to world peace its real aim was to hijack the un using it as a pro socialist organization to advance the communist movement communist influence was so entrenched in the un that the organization acted as a veritable front group for the soviet union fbi director j edgar hoover stated in 1963 that communist diplomats assigned to the un represent the backbone of russian intelligence operations in this country even after the collapse of the soviet bloc the communist legacy remained widespread in the un the wall street journal reported in 1991 on the eve of the soviet collapse many of those working within the secretariat or at missions in its vicinity argue that communism left a legacy within the un bureaucracy it works like a scorpion s stinger says one un professional the scorpion east bloc socialism dies but the stinger remains poisonous and strikes new victims westerners who worked at the un found themselves surrounded by what many have called a communist mafia today the ccp uses the un as a propaganda platform for example top un officials including the secretary general have promoted the ccp s one belt one road obor a global infrastructure and investment initiative as a way to tackle poverty in the developing world in reality the initiative is a means for the ccp to expand its international hegemony obor has left many countries in debt crises pakistan for example requested a 6 billion bailout from the international monetary fund because of the country s debt resulting from obor loans others have been forced to cede control of critical infrastructure to the prc sri lanka had to lease its strategic port of hambantota to beijing for ninety nine years to pay off its debt moreover the initiative enables the ccp to exert control over the politics and economies of participating countries while undermining human rights and democracy in those countries b subverting the un s humanitarian ideals another of the united nations objectives is to improve human rights and promote freedom this is a universal principle but the ccp together with other corrupt regimes denies the universality of human rights the communist party claims that human rights are the internal affairs of each country using this as an excuse for its monstrous repression of religious freedom ethnic minorities and dissidents the ccp even praises itself as a defender of human rights claiming that it had lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and taking credit for the hard work and ingenuity of the chinese people the ccp has used the un as a platform to attack the democratic values of the west relying on its alliances with developing nations to subvert the efforts of free nations to promote universal values due to manipulation by communist factors the un has not only done little to improve human rights but also become a tool used by communist regimes to whitewash their poor human rights records dore gold former israeli ambassador to the un asserted the un is not a benign but ineffective world body it has actually accelerated and spread global chaos gold outlined numerous examples including the un s value neutrality and the immorality of moral equivalence and moral relativism all of which are left wing concepts intended to negate universal moral values the organization s general corruption the fact that undemocratic countries are allowed to hold the majority of votes and the degree of control given to communist regimes he called the un an abject failure writing that it was dominated by anti western forces dictatorships state sponsors of terrorism and america s worst enemies for example countries with poor human rights records are allowed to become member states of the human rights council utterly compromising the worth of the council s human rights reviews furthermore the prc has bought off many developing countries ensuring that all criticism of the communist regime s human rights policies has been shelved the un s tyranny of the majority has made it a tool for communist regimes to repeatedly block efforts by free countries to promote liberty and human rights this has prompted the united states to withdraw from the human rights council which was hijacked by authoritarian states the so called international conventions adopted have done nothing to bind totalitarian countries which simply mouth the slogans and catchphrases while doing nothing to implement them the un charter is very similar to the soviet constitution and in direct opposition to the us constitution the charter s purpose is not to protect the rights of people but to serve the interests of political leaders likewise the soviet constitution superficially gave the citizens some rights but in fact many specific laws were stipulated as within the scope of the law which allowed the soviet regime to arbitrarily deprive citizens of their rights according to its interpretations of within the scope of the law the un charter and its various contracts and conventions define people s rights in the same equivocal way for example in the international covenant on civil and political rights statements like everyone has the right are attached to provisions such as the above mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those which are provided by law this is not just an arbitrary or coincidental choice of blueprint but a back door built in on purpose by communist forces as griffin wrote in fact every single right outlined in the united nations covenant on human rights may be legally denied if in the opinion of the politicians it is necessary to protect national security or public order or public safety or public health or public morals or the rights freedoms or reputations of others most wars and national crimes are committed in the name of one of these it is difficult for free countries to arbitrarily deprive citizens of their freedom yet communist regimes can openly take advantage of loopholes in the un s human rights code c promoting communist political ideas worldwide the communist specter through its agents repeatedly raises global problems and claims that these problems can be solved only through international collaboration and global power structures its true goal is to establish a world government consequently various countries are restricted and regulated more and more by a growing number of international treaties thus weakening their national sovereignty many groups support international power structures of this sort and although such groups are not necessarily communist their claims are consistent with communist goals that is to eventually abolish individual nations and establish a world government in chapter sixteen we detailed how communism uses the claim of protecting the environment to advance its agenda environmentalism has gone hand in hand with the drive to weaken national sovereignty and promote supranational political power a media personality said on earth day 1970 humanity needs a world order the fully sovereign nation is incapable of dealing with the poisoning of the environment the management of the planet therefore whether we are talking about the need to prevent war or the need to prevent ultimate damage to the conditions of life requires a world government the humanist manifesto ii of 1973 also declared we have reached a turning point in human history where the best option is to transcend the limits of national sovereignty and to move toward the building of a world community thus we look to the development of a system of world law and a world order based upon transnational federal government in fact the establishment of the un environment programme came about precisely because a group that advocated for a global confederacy in 1972 considered the environmental issue to be a world issue and therefore called for the development of global solutions and the establishment of a global environmental protection agency its first director was maurice strong a canadian with strong socialist leanings at the 1992 un earth summit in rio de janeiro also known as the un conference on environment and development 178 governments voted to adopt agenda 21 this eight hundred page blueprint includes content on the environment women s rights medical care and so on an influential environmental researcher who became an official of the un environment programme said national sovereignty the power of a country to control events within its territory has lost much of its meaning in today s world where borders are routinely breached by pollution international trade financial flows and refugees nations are in effect ceding portions of their sovereignty to the international community and beginning to create a new system of international environmental governance as a means of solving otherwise unmanageable problems superficially many arguments for a world government seem reasonable but their true purpose is to spread communism and dominate the world communist regimes often publicly decry interference in other countries affairs while actively participating in the various international organizations promoting the concept of global governance boutros ghali initiated rapid advances in the un s march toward world government during his term as secretary general from 1992 to 1996 he called for the formation of a permanent un army and pressed for the right to collect taxes the united states opposed allowing him to serve a second term and one can only imagine how much more powerful the un would be today if not for that intervention in 2002 secretary general kofi annan said in an age of interdependence global citizenship is a crucial pillar of progress robert chandler a former us air force colonel and white house strategist believed that annan s so called progress threatened national sovereignty and opened the way for a global civil society under the governance of a massive faceless international bureaucracy which would relegate individuals to the status of worker ants in a socialist authoritarian universe un programs like teaching toward a culture of peace were actually organized and overseen by ultra leftists whom chandler believed were intent on destroying national sovereignty the 1958 book the naked communist outlined the forty five goals of communists one of which states promote the u n as the only hope for mankind if its charter is rewritten demand that it be set up as one world government with its own independent armed forces a world government cannot be established in the short term thus communists and globalists use various issues to establish international institutions in various fields then promote the unity of these institutions and continue to advocate for dependence on the un d world government and totalitarianism there is nothing wrong with envisioning a better world or future seeking to establish a world government to solve all of mankind s problems however is no different from the misguided dictatorship of the proletariat or central planning promoted by communism advocating for a world government strengthening the role of the un portraying the un as a panacea for solving all problems in today s world all of this is part of an attempt to play god and arrange the future of humankind were such a regime established it would inevitably descend into communist style totalitarianism to attract countries to join it a world government would invariably offer tantalizing benefits promises of welfare and a blueprint of a global utopia for humankind however an unavoidable issue faced by a world government is how to actually implement its policies be they political military economic or other to push through its policies on a global scale such a government couldn t take the form of a free republic like that of the united states by necessity it would be a totalitarian regime like that of the soviet union or the prc this centralization would elevate the power of the government to an unmatched level and its control over society would be unprecedented at this stage such a world government wouldn t bother with achieving consensus among its member countries or heed any commitments made to them instead it would solely focus on the forceful implementation of its policies in the world today there exist great differences among countries many countries have neither orthodox faiths nor free societies not to mention respect for human rights or high moral standards if countries were to combine to form a world government that government would have to adopt the lowest standard among them eliminating any requirements relating to faith and belief morality and human rights in other words countries would be given a free pass on these issues as the concept of so called neutrality in religion morality and human rights would be used to unite them a world government would inevitably promote a mainstream culture in order to unify the world despite the fact that each country has its own cultural traditions and religious beliefs of the experts scholars and government officials who actively advocate a world government the majority are atheists or those who hold progressive views on religious faith clearly a world government would have atheism as its core value an inevitable consequence given that communism is the force behind a world government furthermore because cultural and linguistic differences between peoples would impede global authority proponents of world government often oppose concepts like patriotism or localism which are essential for the well being of nation states the government of a country or region whose people do not have a shared faith and culture could rely only on totalitarian rule to stay in power and the result would be the loss of individual freedom to maintain its rule a world government would forcibly and violently implement ideological re education to prevent fragmentation or independence movements by member countries a world government would greatly strengthen its military and police forces and tighten its control over freedom of speech and the media in the end a world government could only be realized as a totalitarian project featuring the same enslavement abuse and degradation of its subjects seen under communist regimes today and throughout history but instead of being confined to a single country this totalitarianism would extend to the entire world leaving the communist specter practically unopposed in its plan to corrupt human traditional culture eradicate belief in the divine and finally destroy humanity itself 4 cultural globalization a means of corrupting humanity as cultural exchanges and capital flows expand throughout the world the various deviant cultural forms that communism has established over the past century such as modern art literature and thought deviant entertainment and lifestyles and consumerism are transmitted globally during this process the traditions of various ethnic groups are interrupted and severed from their original meaning resulting in hollow degenerate lifestyles geared toward consumption and profit breaking down morality and society wherever they are spread willi münzenberg the german communist activist and one of the founders of the frankfurt school said organise the intellectuals and use them to make western civilization stink only then after they have corrupted all its values and made life impossible can we impose the dictatorship of the proletariat indeed as described in previous chapters of this book the heritage of western civilization has been replaced by deviated modern pop culture and its spiritual values have been largely overturned by variants of marxism globalization and globalism bring this degeneracy to all corners of the earth globally the united states leads in the political economic and military arenas its unique position in these fields carries over to american popular culture which has been readily accepted and adopted by other countries and regions after infiltrating and corrupting family life politics the economy law arts the media and popular culture across all aspects of daily life in the united states communism made use of cultural globalization to export this corrupted culture seen as the newest most desirable trends from america this culture spread across the entire world through hollywood movies even the inhabitants of china s far flung conservative inland villages learned that single motherhood extramarital affairs and sexual liberation were all normal aspects of life in the advanced west rock n roll became extremely popular across the world from ecuador in south america to malaysia in southeast asia to fiji in the pacific islands in education the ideology underpinning the common core curriculum created by cultural marxists was almost instantaneously reflected in taiwan s secondary school textbooks in the blink of an eye the occupy wall street movement in new york was shown on television screens in the remotest mountain hamlets of india cultural globalization is the hurricane that blows the deviant culture of the west and the party culture of communist totalitarian regimes throughout the entire world relentlessly sweeping away the traditional values that have guided humanity for thousands of years a destroying the world s cultural traditions every ethnic culture has unique characteristics and carries the deep influences of its own special history despite the differences between ethnic customs they all observe the same divinely bestowed universal values in their traditions after the industrial revolution technological development brought about convenience and simultaneously tradition was labeled by progressives as backward measuring everything based on its modernness novelty and progress or whether it has commercial value is now standard communism promotes values that seem noble but in reality are aimed at having humankind abandon traditional values replacing them with homogeneous and deteriorated modern values instead today s so called common values formed by cultural exchange in the process of globalization aren t from any particular tradition they are modern values the elements and values that are adopted by globalism must by necessity deviate from tradition they include only the crassest elements of existing cultural heritage as well as the aspects that can be commercialized notions about the common destiny of humankind and our common future are the results of such deviated values the lowest standard that is recognized during cultural globalization manifests in consumer culture product design and marketing driven by economic interests are entirely centered on appealing to consumers base instincts the aim is to control humankind by seducing indulging and satisfying people s superficial desires this global consumerist culture is used to corrupt tradition in multiple ways first the unique characteristics and meaning behind a product as originated from its ethnic culture are removed in other words tradition is taken away from products through deculturalization or standardization the more alienated a group of people is from their cultural heritage and faith the more susceptible they become to such a simplified consumerist culture over time through globalization this population s customs and identity devolve to only the low level necessary to maintain a cheap commercial culture bereft of meaning and morality second the globalized media industry and its monopolies have enabled communist elements to easily make use of the degenerated ideas behind products they advertise the superficial cultural aspects of products and introduce marxist ideology while promoting them the hybridization of cultures through globalization thus becomes another channel for promoting communist ideology third a global culture makes consumerism the mainstream culture of society commercials films television shows and social media constantly bombard consumers with the idea that they are not living a real life if they don t consume or own certain products or seek to be entertained in particular ways communism uses different means and entertainment to prompt people to pursue the satisfaction of their base desires as people indulge these desires they move away from the spiritual plane causing them to deviate from their long held divine beliefs and traditional values within a few short generations as communism quickly spreads its deteriorated ideology amid the backdrop of globalization it utilizes the herd mentality with frequent exposure to news media social media commercials television shows and films people are bombarded with various anti traditional ideas and narratives this creates an illusion that such deteriorated trends represent a global consensus people gradually become numb to the damage wrought by these ideologies as twisted behaviors come to be seen as fashionable and people are urged to take pride in them substance abuse sexual liberation degenerate music abstract art and much more are all spread in this fashion modern art is degenerate and violates all traditional definitions of aesthetics some people may have known this from the very start but after modern artworks are constantly exhibited in major metropolitan areas and sold at high prices and when the media frequently reports on dark and strange works normal people begin to believe that they re the ones who ve fallen out of touch with fashion and that it s their taste in art that needs to be updated gaslighted by this trend people learn to deny their innate sense of what constitutes beauty and accept the hideous aesthetics of deteriorated art all manner of degenerate culture masked as western culture is currently being spread to every corner of the world hollywood in particular has been a major carrier of various narratives that stem from cultural marxism the special characteristics of the movie industry allow it to make people subconsciously accept its values as described in chapter thirteen film has the power to depict compelling atmospheres narratives and personalities immersing audiences in the director s viewpoint hollywood movies play an enormous role in shaping audiences values and worldview in this book we have also discussed how cultural marxism has taken over western education see chapter twelve and in turn exposed foreign students studying in western countries to various leftist ideologies when they return to their countries they spread these ideologies which are seen as attractive because western countries are more technologically advanced and economically developed thus invasive modern trends encounter little resistance as they spread and destroy the local traditional culture these modern globalist values have also become ubiquitous and mainstream via the corporate culture of multinational corporations their promotion of sexual liberation has seriously corroded the moral values of traditional society in 2016 a large global chain retailer announced that their store dressing rooms and restrooms would be friendly to transgender people meaning that men could enter women s restrooms or locker rooms at will if they self identified as women the american family association said the policy was harmful to women and children and called on consumers to boycott the company to date the association s pledge to boycott the store chain has received more than 1 5 million signatures boycotts have become unrealistic however as more and more companies across society have adopted such policies communism is able to utilize the herd mentality because many people do not have a strong will once humankind deviates from divinely imparted traditions everything becomes relative and changes over time the situation becomes ripe for exploitation under the conditions of globalization mutual respect and tolerance of different national cultures have become mainstream communism has used this to distort the concept of tolerance and make value neutrality a global consensus thereby advocating deviant ideas b the un s role in spreading degenerate values article 13 of the un convention on the rights of the child states the child shall have the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to seek receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds regardless of frontiers either orally in writing or in print in the form of art or through any other media of the child s choice some scholars have asked if parents do not allow their children to wear t shirts with satanic symbolism does it constitute a violation of children s rights do children have the right to choose how they speak to their parents children may lack judgment if they commit acts of violence or violate ethical norms can parents discipline them these worries are not unwarranted in 2017 ontario canada passed a law prohibiting parents from denying their children s wishes in regard to gender expression i e children could select their own genders parents who don t accept their child s chosen gender identity may be considered to be engaging in child abuse and their children could be taken away by the state in 1990 the world health organization announced that homosexuality was not a mental illness which greatly elevated and spurred on the lgbt movement worldwide south africa was the first country to introduce a new convention at the un human rights council that required that the recognition of sexual orientation and gender identity be used as an indicator of upholding human rights the convention the first that directly targeted sexual orientation and gender identity was ultimately adopted in reality the convention normalizes what used to be considered deviant ideas by attributing to them the same importance as natural rights communism thus uses globalization to distort and destroy traditional culture and moral values in an all encompassing fashion this includes the use of developed countries global enterprises and international institutions people are immersed in the superficial convenience of a globalized lifestyle but they are not aware of the rapid transformations occurring at the level of ideology and consciousness in just a few decades these completely new ideas have engulfed many parts of the world wherever these ideas go the culture changes and even the oldest and most closed countries are unable to escape if this trend continues civilization itself will be lost traditional culture is the root of human existence and an important safeguard for human beings to maintain moral standards it is the key for people to return to the righteous path and be saved by their creator in the process of globalization traditional culture has been twisted and ruined by the arrangements of the communist specter the long term moral crisis human civilization faces is unprecedented 5 upholding national heritage and universal values different nationalities and countries have existed for millennia although they inhabit different regions have different social forms and political systems use different languages and have different cultural and psychological qualities all share common universal values these universal values are the core of traditional culture for all ethnic groups around the world especially after the end of the cold war communism s representatives in both the east and the west began using international political economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation to expand and control globalization globalist institutions promote degenerate values in virtually every country on earth aiding the communist specter s systematic destruction of universal values traditional culture and faith in the divine by using globalization in conjunction with other historical processes over the last few centuries the communist specter has greatly expanded its power in the human world in the first half of the twentieth century communists took power in russia and china slaughtering the cultural elites and destroying the traditional culture of these two vast nations after world war ii the communist camp infiltrated and controlled international organizations such as the un abused democratic procedures to allow the majority to conquer the minority and used money to win over small countries in an attempt to use the un s supranational power to spread its political system worldwide in the little more than a century since the emergence of communism on the global stage these transnational political and economic forces have come to wield formidable power imperiling sovereign nations everywhere with the agenda of establishing a world government only with the return of tradition can people restore their national identity and sovereignty and create a harmonious international environment governed by upright universal values this will allow humankind to banish the communist specter and live under the protection and grace of the divine read next chapter eighteen updated march 28 2021 read the series here how the specter of communism

originally posted at china financial markets many americans are worried about the seemingly inexorable rise in u s debt whether government debt household debt or business debt they are right to be concerned rapidly rising debt is a problem not just in the united states but in many other countries too including china parts of europe and most of the developing world in today s environment it seems reasonable levels of economic growth cannot be achieved unless boosted by even faster growth in debt with so much debt in the world and with debt levels rising so quickly people tend to think that economists have studied this issue deeply and fully understand it but there continues to be a great deal of confusion about debt and about whether and why excessive debt levels can harm growth prospects to try to address these issues this blog post is divided into two parts the first part discusses debt and some of the conditions under which it affects the prospects for economic growth the second part argues that at least two of the reasons that debt has been rising inexorably in the united states for several years are the country s rising income inequality and its persistent trade deficit surprising as it may seem at first glance these two conditions operate the same way they distort the level and structure of american savings as long as income inequality remains high and the united states runs large deficits the resulting savings distortions will continue to mean that u s debt levels have to rise to prevent the economy from slowing and unemployment from rising why debt matters what are productive and nonproductive debt to begin with broadly speaking debt can be divided into two types self liquidating debt is used to fund investment projects that increase economic productivity enough after including all associated positive and negative externalities to service the debt fully in such cases an increase in debt is used to create an equal or greater increase in assets while this usually leaves the overall economy better off there could still be an argument about whether it is best to fund a particular project with debt versus equity about the best or least risky way of structuring the borrowing and about how the debt and its subsequent repayment affects income distribution all other debt funds household consumption nonproductive government activities such as military spending welfare programs and other kinds of consumption on behalf of households and nonproductive investment by either the government or businesses in some cases this debt can have a positive impact on economic welfare such as when debt is used to smooth out consumption over a person s life cycle in other cases it can be positive or negative for economic well being or for overall economic growth depending on how it affects the way income is distributed indeed this is one of its least understood but most important functions self liquidating debt adds to the total debt in the economy but rather than heighten the economy s debt burden it usually reduces the burden by increasing the wealth or productive capacity created by the project by more than the cost of the project the most common form this debt takes is business investment or government investment in infrastructure i say that this type of debt usually reduces a country s debt burden rather than saying it always does because this may not be the case if the debt is badly structured if for instance debt servicing costs are severely mismatched relative to a project s net increase in production such a project can raise uncertainty in ways that adversely affect the rest of the economy but except in cases of very badly structured highly inverted debt self liquidating debt is ultimately sustainable because it allows economic actors to service the rise in debt by more than the associated debt servicing costs in principle this means that the debt can be repaid fully out of the additional value created leaving everyone better off in the aggregate that said it is possible in some instances that certain sectors of the economy would benefit disproportionately and other sectors would be worse off with the winners exceeding the losers debt that is not self liquidating increases the total debt in the economy and because it doesn t improve debt servicing capacity usually adds to the economy s debt burden again i say usually rather than always because in some cases this second kind of debt leaves the economy s debt burden no worse off if the debt is used for consumption smoothing for instance in other cases such debt can even reduce the debt burden if the debt redistributes wealth in ways that increase the economy s wealth producing capacity 1 debt that isn t self liquidating is necessarily serviced only through implicit or explicit transfers from one economic sector to another in such cases the borrower can service the debt by appropriating income from other projects including taxes if the borrower is the government if the borrower defaults on the other hand the debt servicing cost is transferred to the creditors there are other ways that governments in particular can service such debt by effectively transferring the cost the debt can be eroded by inflation in which case the debt servicing cost is effectively forced onto those who are long monetary assets mainly households that save in the form of bonds bank deposits and other interest sensitive assets if wages are forced down to make it easier for businesses or governments to service their debts the debt servicing cost is forced onto workers if government debt is serviced by expropriation the debt servicing cost is forced onto the rich or onto foreigners one way or another in other words this kind of debt is serviced by explicitly assigning or implicitly allocating the costs by way of a transfer of wealth is excessive debt bad for the economy unfortunately few economists seem able to explain coherently why a heavy debt burden can be harmful to the economy this statement may seem surprising but ask any economist why an economy would suffer from having too much debt and he or she almost always responds that too much debt is a problem because it might cause a debt crisis or undermine confidence in the economy not only that but how much debt is considered too much seems to be an even harder question to answer 2 but this is clearly a circular argument excessive debt wouldn t cause a debt crisis unless it undermined economic growth for some other reason saying that too much debt is harmful for an economy because it might cause a crisis is at best a kind of truism as intelligible as saying that too much debt is harmful for an economy because it might be harmful for the economy what is more this sentiment isn t even correct as a truism admittedly countries with too much debt can certainly suffer debt crises and these events are unquestionably harmful but as british economist john stuart mill explained in an 1867 paper for the manchester statistical society panics do not destroy capital they merely reveal the extent to which it has been previously destroyed by its betrayal into hopelessly unproductive works while a crisis can magnify an existing problem the point mills makes is that a crisis mostly recognizes the harm that has already been done yet paradoxically too much debt doesn t always lead to a crisis historical precedents clearly demonstrate that what sets off a debt crisis is not excessive debt but rather severe balance sheet mismatches for that reason countries with too much debt don t suffer debt crises if they can successfully manage these balance sheet mismatches through a forced restructuring of liabilities china s balance sheets for example may seem horribly mismatched on paper but i have long argued that china is unlikely to suffer a debt crisis even though chinese debt has been excessively high for years and has been rising rapidly as long as the country s banking system is largely closed and its regulators continue to be powerful and highly credible with a closed banking system and powerful regulators beijing can restructure liabilities at will contrary to conventional wisdom however even if a country can avoid a crisis this doesn t mean that it will manage to avoid paying the costs of having too much debt in fact the cost may be worse excessively indebted countries that do not suffer debt crises seem inevitably to end up suffering from lost decades of economic stagnation these periods in the medium to long term have much more harmful economic effects than debt crises do although such stagnation can be much less politically harmful and sometimes less socially harmful debt crises in other words are simply one way that excessive debt can be resolved while they are usually more costly in political and social terms they tend to be less costly in economic terms what are the actual costs of excessive debt so why is excessive debt a bad thing i am addressing this topic in a future book to put it briefly there are at least five reasons why too much debt eventually causes economic growth to drop sharply through either a debt crisis or lost decades of economic stagnation first an increase in debt that does not generate additional debt servicing capacity isn t sustainable however while such debt does not generate real wealth creation or productive capacity or debt servicing capacity which ultimately amount to the same thing it does generate economic activity and the illusion of wealth creation because there are limits to a country s debt capacity once the economy has reached those limits debt creation and the associated economic activity both must decline to the degree that a country relies on an accelerating debt burden to generate economic activity and gdp growth in other words once it reaches debt capacity limits and credit creation slows so does the country s gdp growth and economic activity second and more importantly an excessively indebted economy creates uncertainty about how debt servicing costs are to be allocated in the future as a consequence all economic agents must change their behavior in ways that undermine economic activity and increase balance sheet fragility see endnote 2 this process which is analogous to financial distress costs in corporate finance theory is heavily self reinforcing some countries china is probably the leading example have a high debt burden that is the result of the systematic misallocation of investment into nonproductive projects in these countries it is rare for these investment misallocations or the associated debt to be correctly written down if such a country did correctly write down bad debt it would not be able to report the high gdp growth numbers that it typically does as a result there is a systematic overstatement of gdp growth and of reported assets wealth is overstated by the failure to write down bad debt once debt can no longer rise quickly enough to roll over existing bad debt the debt is directly or indirectly amortized and the overstatement of wealth is explicitly assigned or implicitly allocated to a specific economic sector this causes the growth of gdp and economic activity to understate the real growth in wealth creation by the same amount by which it was previously overstated insofar as the excess debt is owed to foreigners its servicing costs represent a real transfer of resources outside the economy to the extent that the excess debt is domestic its servicing costs usually represent a real transfer of resources from economic sectors that are more likely to use these resources for consumption or investment to sectors that are much less likely to use these resources for consumption or investment in such cases the intra country transfer of resources represented by debt servicing will reduce aggregate demand in the economy and consequently slow economic activity does debt affect demand except for economies in which all resources including labor and capital are fully utilized and for economies that have no slack unutilized resources and labor increases in debt can boost current domestic demand although not always sustainably when households borrow for example they usually do so either to buy homes or to increase consumption i am not sure how much of home buying in the united states spurs new construction and how much represents sales of existing homes but in the latter case the borrowing creates no new demand for the economy except to the extent that the seller uses the proceeds of a home sale to increase consumption of course insofar as borrowing for consumption directly increases aggregate demand by increasing consumption today the repayment of such borrowing reduces consumption tomorrow this is another area that seems to confuse economists enormously standard economic theory states that borrowing simply transfers spending from the lender to the borrower and that repaying debt reverses these transfers in such instances no new demand is created by borrowing nor is it extinguished by repaying but this is only true for an economy that is fully utilizing its labor capital and other resources and in which investment is constrained by high costs of capital in such cases borrowers must bid up the cost of capital to gain access to savings and in so doing they prevent someone else from employing these resources this is when borrowing has no net impact on total demand it simply transfers spending from one part of the economy to another and the only thing that matters for the health of the economy is how efficient any particular use of savings might be and what impact that use has on long term growth but for an economy with substantial slack whose investors are reluctant to engage in new investment because of insufficient demand borrowing does create additional demand while future repayment usually reverses this added demand among the three types of borrowing household government and business household borrowing is not self liquidating and directly increases the country s debt burden this is because aggregate debt rises with no increase in the country s debt servicing capacity or productive capacity except to the extent that the borrowing encourages businesses to invest in manufacturing capacity increases in government debt similarly do not result in equivalent increases in debt servicing or productive capacity except insofar as government borrowing is used to fund investment in productive infrastructure if used to fund consumption household transfers military spending and so on government debt can boost current domestic demand without boosting debt servicing capacity or productive capacity an increase in domestic demand that must later be reversed 3 increases in business debt on the other hand do usually fund productive investment so these increases usually boost debt servicing or productive capacity when businesses borrow capital however for stock buybacks to pay down other debt to cover losses or for nonproductive investment projects usually subsidized by governments this debt functions just like household borrowing for consumption in the sense that it is not self liquidating how american savings are distorted two reasons for rising u s debt i have no way of calculating the extent to which recent increases in u s debt have funded productive or nonproductive activity but a substantial portion of increases in american debt over the past several years is probably almost certainly unsustainable and not self liquidating this is because rising debt is needed to keep growth in economic activity high enough to prevent a rise in unemployment economists don t generally distinguish between growth in economic activity which is mostly what gdp measures and growth in economic wealth or in wealth producing capacity they tend simply to equate the two i discuss this issue in a january 2019 blog post while the two may be equal over the long run however over shorter periods they are not necessarily equal given that the former can exceed the latter especially as a consequence of an unsustainable increase in debt i will not pretend to offer a complete analysis of debt in the u s economy here but there are at least two reasons that the united states has no choice but to encourage an increase in debt to prevent a rise in unemployment the first reason is the u s role in the global balance of payments system and the second one is high levels of u s income inequality although these two factors seem like two different things they work in the same way and for the same reasons why trade deficits actually matter i have explained many times before including here and here that the united states runs trade deficits mainly because the rest of the world exports its excess savings there standard trade theory suggests that under normal conditions the united states should run persistent trade surpluses as i will explain in my next blog post but because of distortions in income distribution in the rest of the world developed economies suffer from excess savings and insufficient demand the way this works is straightforward although it may seem counterintuitive at first there are two ways to boost international competitiveness which in a highly globalized world can lead automatically to higher growth the high road is to boost domestic productivity typically by investing in needed infrastructure education and technology the low road is to reduce relative wages something that can be done directly or indirectly the direct approach is to lower wages or wage growth as for example germany did during and after the hartz reforms of 2003 2005 an indirect way of achieving the same effect is for a country to hold down the value of its currency by doing things like imposing explicit or hidden tariffs subsidizing production factors at the expense of households or increasing household transfers to other sectors of the economy the low road is of course easier to embark on quickly and it effectively entails reducing the household share of what a country produces directly or indirectly in other words households receive less total compensation for producing a given amount the problem with this low road approach is that it reduces total demand as households receive a lower share of gdp they consume a lower share unless there is a commensurate rise in investment the result is that a country is less likely to be able to absorb everything it produces in a closed economy or one in which international trade and capital flows are limited by high frictional costs a country that produces more than it can absorb domestically must allow unwanted inventory to pile up until once debt limits are reached it must close down production facilities and fire workers in a highly globalized world however where the frictional costs of international trade and capital flows are extremely low or even nonexistent it is much easier for such a country to export both the excess production and the excess savings this is the problem policies that increase international competitiveness by lowering the household share of gdp reduce total demand within such countries but these policies also allow these countries to gain a larger share of foreign demand this is the tradeoff that makes this arrangement work for the surplus country while domestic demand shrinks the surplus country more than makes up for it by increasing its share of what is left at the expense of its trade partners whether this state of affairs benefits or harms the global economy depends primarily on where the excess savings are exported if they are exported to a developing country whose domestic investment needs are constrained by insufficient domestic savings they can cause a boost in productive investment that increases the recipient country s domestic demand in such cases the net effect on the world is usually positive if the increase in investment in the recipient country is greater than the reduction in consumption in the exporting country the world is better off although there may still be legitimate disputes about distribution effects but if the excess savings are exported to an advanced economy whose domestic investment needs are not constrained by an inability to access domestic savings these savings do not result in an increase in investment so the world is left with lower demand as i will explain below see where might this argument be wrong when excess savings flow into the united states these savings do not cause investment to rise this is a classic case of beggar thy neighbor policies in which one country benefits at the greater expense of its trade partners much of the world s excess savings flow to rich countries where these funds are not needed rather than to developing countries that can use them productively it is typically the countries with the most open most flexible and best governed financial markets that end up on the receiving end mainly the so called anglo saxon economies and especially the united states the united states runs capital account surpluses in other words not because it is capital short but because the world has excess savings and the united states is the leading safe haven into which to hoard these savings some observers might object to this interpretation after all they might say doesn t the united states have a low savings rate well below its investment rate and doesn t that prove that the united states needs foreign savings not necessarily while this was the case in the nineteenth century when the united states imported capital because it lacked sufficient domestic savings to fund its investment needs it is no longer true in the twenty first century rather than assuming as most economists still do that the united states imports foreign savings because u s savings are too low it is vital to recognize that u s savings are low because the united states imports foreign savings this is because a country with a capital account surplus must by definition run a current account deficit and because investment in that country must also by definition exceed savings most economists see this tautology and mistakenly assume an automatic direction of causality in which foreign capital inflows drive u s investment above the level of u s savings the main reason for this assumption it turns out is because if inflows don t drive up investment they must drive down savings and people have a difficult time understanding how foreign capital inflows can drive down savings but as i will show later see what drives down savings there is nothing mysterious or unlikely about this process why income inequality matters it may seem surprising at first that income inequality has the same economic impact as forced imports of foreign capital by itself income inequality tends to force up the savings rate simply because rich households save more than ordinary or poor households put differently if 100 is transferred from an ordinary american household which consumes perhaps 80 percent of its income and saves 20 percent to a rich household which consumes around 15 percent of its income and saves 85 percent the initial impact of the transfer is to reduce consumption by 65 and increase desired savings by the same amount but that is not the end of the story in any economic system savings can only rise if investment rises if the united states cannot invest the additional savings for reasons which i will discuss below again see where might this argument be wrong if rising income inequality causes u s savings in one part of the economy the rich household that benefitted from the increase in savings to rise this must also cause savings in some other part of the economy to decline again the point is fairly simple total savings cannot rise unless these savings are invested if savings in one part of the economy rise because of a transfer of wealth from poorer households to richer households and if this does not cause investment to rise this very transfer must then repress savings in another part of the economy notice how similar this is to the way the trade deficit works rising savings in one part of the world are exported to the united states and cause savings in the united states to decline in either case if investment doesn t rise savings cannot rise so an increase in savings in one sector or country must cause a reduction of savings in another what drives down savings there are many ways that the import of foreign savings or the additional savings of the rich can drive down savings in the overall economy net capital inflows may strengthen the dollar to a level far higher than it would otherwise be currency appreciation by increasing the value of household income at the expense of the tradable goods sector forces down a country s savings rate in effect increasing the household share of gdp and with it usually the consumption share u s unemployment may be higher than it otherwise would be because of cheap foreign imports that help create the u s current account deficit or because income inequality drives down consumer demand and with it perhaps investment unemployed workers have a negative savings rate as they consume out of their savings so rising unemployment would drive down the savings rate if that happens unemployment would require more government borrowing to fund larger fiscal transfers most of which would cause consumption to rise and savings to decline to reduce unemployment the u s federal reserve might expand credit and the money supply encouraging additional borrowing the capital inflows or looser monetary policy may inflate the prices of real estate stocks and other american assets even setting off asset bubbles a recurring response historically speaking to substantial capital inflows higher asset prices can make americans feel richer creating a wealth effect that drives up consumption the consequent boost in real estate prices could set off additional real estate development some of which might be economically justified and some that might not be technically this would not be a reduction in savings but rather an increase in investment but it would have the same net impact on the capital account to the extent that some real estate development turns out to be economically unjustified in future periods it may be written down with the losses representing a reduction in the total stock of savings u s banks and shadow banks flush with liquidity and needing to create loans may lower lending standards and give loans to households that would otherwise be perceived as too risky as long as there is a normal distribution of risk taking and optimism among american households and this is the case in every country whenever banks lower their consumer lending standards there are households who take out loans and spend the proceeds on additional consumption driving down savings credit card companies and consumer finance companies with abundant liquidity may make consumer credit more widely available and at cheaper rates than they otherwise would notice that these numerous methods of driving down the savings rate can be summarized as one of two either unemployment rises or debt rises because washington is likely to respond to a rise in unemployment by increasing the fiscal deficit or loosening credit conditions in the end the result of rising income inequality and trade deficits is almost always that debt rises faster than it otherwise would that shouldn t be surprising another way of looking at it is that both trade deficits and high income inequality reduce domestic demand so returning the economy to its expected growth rate requires a new source of demand and this new source is almost always generated by debt by the way this explains in part why economists are generally unable to find a correlation between the trade deficit and unemployment or between income inequality and unemployment rather than cause unemployment to rise these conditions can simply force an increase in debt where might this argument be wrong this is a purely logical argument so it would be wrong only if any of the underlying assumptions are wrong the main such assumption is whether investment is not constrained by savings the standard argument is that investment is always constrained by savings and that forcing up savings is positive for investment because even in economies with abundant savings and low interest rates it lowers the cost of funding however marginally if businesses can borrow at a lower rate than before the argument goes there always will be some productive investment opportunity that only becomes profitable at this new lower borrowing cost this outcome must lead to more investment which should lead to more growth over the long run this is the basic argument behind supply side economics and the implicit justification for president donald trump s recent tax cuts most economists agree that investment levels in the united states are low probably too low and that the united states would grow faster over the long term if businesses could be encouraged to invest more given that one of the most efficient ways to boost investment is presumably to make more capital available to businesses at lower costs tax cuts for the rich would theoretically benefit the rest of the country eventually as the additional wealth generated by higher investment trickled down can policies that result in greater income inequality nonetheless leave a country better off it turns out that the answer again depends on the availability of savings in the economy in a capital scare environment like a typical developing economy policies that force up the domestic savings rate can result in a substantial one for one increase in domestic investment for every unit reduction in consumption in such a case total demand is unchanged since lower consumption is matched by higher investment the economy grows as quickly as ever in the short run while getting wealthier in the long run however this isn t necessarily the case in a capital rich environment like most advanced economies today in recent years the financial system has been awash with liquidity interest rates have been at all time lows and u s corporations have been sitting on hoards of cash that they seem unable to put to productive use in such cases most economists would agree that every unit reduction in consumption is likely to be matched by a smaller increase in investment so in the short run total demand would decline this means that supply side policies can reduce short term growth in the united states because these policies cause a drop in total demand assuming that lower consumption is only partially matched by higher investment nonetheless as long as at least part of the reduction in consumption is matched by an increase in productive investment it is still possible to argue that the country would be better off in the long run because investment increases productive capacity in such cases the rich benefit immediately from tax cuts for the rich while the rest of society benefits eventually but counterintuitively for most economists it might be a mistake to assume that insofar as supply side policies increase the availability of capital and lower its cost conditions that force up the desired savings rate must always lead to additional investment there are conditions under which such policies may actually lead to less investment and this outcome is especially likely today in most advanced economies all it requires is that broadly speaking all or most investment falls into one of two categories the first category consists of projects whose value is not sensitive to marginal changes in demand perhaps because they bring about very evident and significant increases in productivity or because the economy suffers from significant underinvestment the second category consists of projects whose value ultimately varies as a function of changes in demand in the former case these projects often in infrastructure are typically and for obvious reasons more likely to be found in developing countries in which capital is scarce than in today s advanced economies in the early 1980s for example china reportedly had only a handful of commercial airports a country as big as china urgently needed far more than it had so it could be argued that whether china was expected to grow at 10 percent annually 5 percent or even zero percent it nonetheless needed additional airport capacity in that case the need to invest is not sensitive to the expected growth in demand at some point however once china has filled the obvious airport gap whether or not the country needs to build more airports depends on its growth prospects a rapidly growing china will need more additional airport capacity than a slow growing china in which case investment in airports would fall into the second category which consists of projects whose profitability is sensitive to demand conditions by dividing investment into these two categories it becomes clear that policies that aim to force up desired savings and constrain consumption can have two contradictory effects on total investment forcing up savings increases investments that aren t sensitive to marginal changes in demand by making more capital available at lower costs constraining consumption however reduces investments that are sensitive to marginal changes in demand by lowering the demand that drives the profitability of such investments what matters is simple arithmetic the relative size of these two categories in economies where only some investment is sensitive to demand fluctuations and most investment isn t most developing economies conditions like income inequality that boost the savings rate can lift total investment and by extension long term growth but in economies where the profitability of most investments is a function of changes in demand income inequality can result in less total desired investment rather than more greater capital availability at lower interest rates may cause certain additional marginal investments to be made but the resulting increase in investment can easily be overwhelmed by a reduction in investment set off by slower consumption growth put differently if u s companies are reluctant to invest not because the cost of capital is high but rather because expected profitability is low they are unlikely to respond to the trade off between cheaper capital and lower demand by investing more with less consumption businesses that manufacture consumer goods are more likely to close down factories or postpone investment plans the claim that higher desired savings can lead to less investment may at first sound outlandish and marriner eccles 1890 1977 a former chairman of the federal reserve board struggled to make just this point in the 1930s this seems to be what happened in germany after the hartz reforms as well as income was transferred from german workers to german businesses in the form of soaring profits income inequality in germany worsened as expected german savings rose but unexpectedly investment actually declined perhaps in partial response to the increase in savings the same seems to have happened in the united states following last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut by the trump administration as an article this week in reuters reminds us the white house had predicted that the massive fiscal stimulus package marked by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent would boost business spending and job growth the tax cuts came into effect in january 2018 but rather than cause an increase in business investment the tax cuts seem to have had no impact or even a slightly negative one which shouldn t come as a surprise if american businesses already had access to as much capital as they needed the national association of business economics nabe quarterly business conditions poll published on monday found that while some companies reported accelerating investments because of lower corporate taxes 84 percent of respondents said they had not changed plans that compares to 81 percent in the previous survey published in october the nabe survey also suggested a further slowdown in business spending after moderating sharply in the third quarter of 2018 the survey s measure of capital spending fell in january to its lowest level since july 2017 expectations for capital spending for the next three months also weakened what can be done given these facts the expected effects of income inequality and capital account surpluses and the accompanying trade deficits on the u s economy all depend almost exclusively on what people assume about investment if policies or conditions that increase savings cause u s investment to rise then income inequality and capital account surpluses trade deficits can be positive for american growth if not these effects will necessarily either increase u s unemployment or more likely u s debt so assuming that income inequality and capital account surpluses trade deficits are not positive for american growth what can the united states do to mitigate these effects limit foreign capital inflows the united states must reduce its trade deficit with the world but not by addressing the trade deficit directly through import tariffs or quotas remember that because the u s trade deficit is the automatic consequence of the u s capital account surplus as long as the country is forced to import foreign capital it will run a trade deficit meaning that debt must rise if the country is to avoid a rise in unemployment import tariffs or quotas will only reduce the u s trade deficit to the extent that they reduce foreign capital inflows and it is not at all clear that they will do so in fact they are at least as likely to increase inflows instead the united states must address foreign capital inflows directly perhaps by taxing them reverse income inequality there are many ways in which the united states can reverse income inequality washington could make the income tax code more progressive for example strengthen the country s social safety net raise minimum wages or increase infrastructure spending 4 force up productive investment domestically if the us decides that it cannot choose but to tolerate high levels of income inequality and run large capital account surpluses it can at least decide to match the resulting increase in savings availability with higher investment especially by boosting funding for infrastructure in this way keeping unemployment from rising doesn t require that debt rise otherwise debt must continue to rise to prevent savings to adjust in the form of high unemployment aside from this blog i write a monthly newsletter that covers some of the same topics those who are interested in receiving the newsletter should write to me at chinfinpettisyahoocom subject request 20to 20receive 20newsletter stating affiliation notes 1 because this may seem surprising to many it is probably worth specifying how the wealth redistribution impact of debt can leave an economy better off even when the debt is nonproductive first debt leaves an economy better off in cases in which productive investment is constrained by low savings if it takes purchasing power from sectors of the economy that save a very low share of their income or from sectors that save in nonproductive ways by hoarding gold foreign currency or other assets and gives that purchasing power to sectors that save a high share of their income in productive ways second debt leaves an economy better off in cases in which demand is low and savings excessive if it redistributes wealth from sectors of the economy that save a high share of their income to sectors that consume a high share of their income of course in these cases the debt itself matters only because of its role in income redistribution which i address in the next paragraph and which in principle can be managed more efficiently in other ways even if these other ways are sometimes politically harder to implement 2 as i will explain more in a future book a country has excessive debt when there is enough uncertainty about how future debt servicing costs will be allocated to cause economic agents to change their behavior in ways that adversely affect the economy in such a scenario the rich would take money out of the country for example while business owners would disinvest and investors would speculate on short term investments meanwhile workers would organize and become more militant the middle class would save by hoarding nonproductive assets like gold collectibles or foreign currency and policymakers would shorten their time horizons 3 some economists argue that government debt need not ever be repaid and that it can simply be monetized or inflated away but of course that doesn t mean that the debt isn t repaid it simply means that the repayment takes the form of a hidden tax on monetary savings rather than an explicit tax 4 throughout history income inequality also has been reversed in ways that destroy wealth rather than redistribute it such as war revolution or massive debt defaults either at home or abroad historically very high levels of income inequality in the united states and elsewhere in the world have always eventually been partly reversed either in positive ways or negative ways rather than discuss whether or not reversing income inequality is desirable perhaps it would be better to recognize that it will almost certainly happen eventually anyway it is therefore more important to discuss how it should be done
08 02 2019 chartalism and marxism proponents of modern monetary theory serve to mislead and divert the labour movement argues michael roberts modern monetary theory mmt has become flavour of the time among many left economic views in recent years the new leftwing democrat alexandria ocasio cortez is apparently a supporter and a leading mmt exponent recently discussed the theory and its policy implications with labour s john mcdonnell 1 mmt has some traction on the left as it appears to offer theoretical support for policies of fiscal spending funded by central bank money and the running up of budget deficits and public debt without fear of crises and thus backing policies of government spending on infrastructure projects job creation and industry in direct contrast to neoliberal mainstream policies of austerity and minimal government intervention so in this article i shall offer my view on the worth of mmt and its policy implications for the labour movement first i will attempt to bring out the similarities and differences with marx s monetary theory mmt has its base in the ideas of what is called chartalism georg friedrich knapp a german economist coined the term in his state theory of money which was published in german in 1905 and translated into english in 1924 the name derives from the latin charta in the sense of a token or ticket chartalism argues that money originated with state attempts to direct economic activity rather than as a spontaneous solution to the problems with barter or as a means with which to tokenise debt it argues that generalised commodity exchange historically only came into being after the state was able to create the need to use its sovereign currency by imposing taxes on the population for the chartalist the ability of money to act as a unit of account for credit debt depends fundamentally on trust in the power of the sovereign to impose their will on the population the use of money as a unit of account for debts credits predates the emergence of an economy based around the generalised exchange of commodities so chartalism argues that money first arose as a unit of account out of debt and not out of exchange keynes was very much a fan of chartalism but it is clearly opposed to marx s view that money is analytically inconceivable without understanding commodity exchange can the chartalist mmt and marxist theory of money be made compatible or complementary or is one of them wrong my short answers would be 1 money predates capitalism but not because of the state 2 yes the state can create money but it does not control its price so confidence in its money can disappear and 3 a strict chartalist position is not compatible with marxist money theory but mmt has complementary features let me now try to expand on those arguments modern monetary theory and the marxist theory of money are complementary in that both are endogenous theories of money they both reject the quantity theory of money namely that inflation or deflation is dependent on the decisions of central banks to pump in credit money or not on the contrary it is the demand for money that drives the supply ie banks make loans and as a result deposits and debt are created to fund the loans not vice versa in that sense both mmt and marxist theory recognise that money is not a veil over the real economy but that the modern capitalist economy is a monetary one through and through both marx and the mmt exponents agree that the so called quantity theory of money as expounded in the past by chicago economist milton friedman and others which dominated the policy of governments in the early 1980s is wrong governments and central banks cannot ameliorate the booms and slumps in capitalism by trying to control the money supply the dismal record of the current quantitative easing qe programmes adopted by major central banks to try and boost the economy confirms that central bank balance sheets have rocketed since the crisis in 2008 but bank credit growth has not and neither has real gdp growth but the marxist theory of money makes an important distinction from the mmt capitalism is a monetary economy capitalists start with money capital to invest in production and commodity capital which in turn through the expending of labour power and its exploitation eventually delivers new value that is realised in more money capital thus the demand for money capital drives the demand for credit banks create money or credit as part of this process of capitalist accumulation but not as something that makes finance capital separate from capitalist production mmt chartalists argue that the demand for money is driven by the animal spirits of individual agents keynesian or by the state needing credit chartalist in contrast the marxist theory of money reckons that the demand for money and thus its price is ultimately set by the pace of accumulation of capital and capitalist consumption theory and history that raises the underlying issue between mmt and marxism marx s theory of money is specific to capitalism as a mode of production while mmt and chartalism is ahistorical for marx under capitalism money is the representation of value and thus of surplus value in m c p c m m can exchange with c because m represents c and m represents c money could not make exchange possible if exchangeability were not already inherent in commodity production if it were not a representation of socially necessary abstract labour and thus of value in that sense money does not arise in exchange but instead is the monetary representation of exchange value melt or socially necessary labour time snlt marx s theory analyses the functions of money in a capitalist commodity economy it is a historically specific theory not a general theory of money throughout history nor a theory of money in pre capitalist economies so if it is true that money arose first in history as a unit of account for taxes and debt payments as the chartalists and keynes argue that would not contradict marx s theory of money in capitalism anyway i have considerable doubts that historically state debt was the reason for the appearance of money david graeber the anarchist anthropologist appears to argue this in his book 5000 years of debt but it does not wash well with me marx argues that money emerges naturally as commodity production is generalised the state merely validates the money form it does not invent it indeed i think graeber s quote from locke summarises the argument well locke insisted that one can no more make a small piece of silver by relabelling it a shilling than one can make a short man taller by declaring there are now 15 inches in a foot p340 in the classic statement of chartalism knapp argued that states have historically nominated the unit of account and by demanding that taxes be paid in a particular form ensured that this form would circulate as means of payment every taxpayer would have to get their hands on enough of the arbitrarily defined money and so would be embroiled in monetary exchange joseph schumpeter refuted this approach when he said had knapp merely asserted that the state may declare an object or warrant or token bearing a sign to be lawful money and that a proclamation to this effect that a certain pay token or ticket will be accepted in discharge of taxes must go a long way toward imparting some value to that pay token or ticket he would have asserted a truth but a platitudinous one had he asserted that such action of the state will determine the value of that pay token or ticket he would have asserted an interesting but false proposition 2 in other words chartalism is either obvious and right or interesting and wrong out of thin air marx argued that money in capitalism has three main functions as a measure of value as a means of exchange and money as money which includes debt payments the function of measure of value follows from marx s labour theory of value and this is the main difference with the chartalists mmt who so far as i can tell have no theory of value at all and thus no theory of surplus value in effect for mmt exponents value is ignored for the primacy of money in social and economic relations take this explanation by one supporter of mmt of its relation to marx s value theory money is not a mere expression or representation of aggregate private value creation instead mmt supposes that money s fiscal backbone and macro economic cascade together actualise a shared material horizon of production and distribution like marxism mmt grounds value in the construction and maintenance of a collective material reality it accordingly rejects neoclassical utility theory which roots value in the play of individual preferences only in contrast to marxism mmt argues that the production of value is conditioned by money s abstract fiscal capacity and the hierarchy of mediation it supports mmt hardly dismisses the pull of physical gravitation on human reality rather it implicitly deprioritises gravity s causality in political and economic processes showing how the ideal conditions the real via money s distributed pyramidal structure 3 if you can work through this scholastic jargon i think you can take this to mean that mmt differs from marx s theory of money by saying that money is not tied to any law of value that drags it into place like gravity but has the freedom to expand and indeed change value itself money is the primary causal force on value not vice versa in my view this is nonsense it echoes the ideas of french socialist pierre proudhon in the 1840s who argued that what was wrong with capitalism was the monetary system itself not the exploitation of labour and the capitalist mode of production here is what marx had to say about proudhon s view in his chapter on money in the grundrisse can the existing relations of production and the relations of distribution which correspond to them be revolutionised by a change in the instrument of circulation for marx the doctrine that proposes tricks of circulation as a way of on the one hand avoiding the violent character of these social changes and on the other of making these changes appear not to be a presupposition but gradual result of these transformations in circulation would be a fundamental error and misunderstanding of the reality of capitalism in other words separating money from value and indeed making money the primary force for change in capitalism fails to recognise the reality of social relations under capitalism and production for profit without a theory of value the mmters enter a fictitious economic world where the state can issue debt and have it converted into credits on the state account by a central bank at will and with no limit or repercussions in the real world of productive capital for marx money makes money through the exploitation of labour in the capitalist production process the new value created is embodied in commodities for sale the value realised is represented by an amount of money for marx money is a commodity like gold or silver whose value could be exchanged with other commodities so the price or value of gold anchored the monetary value of all commodities but if the value or price of gold changed because of a change in the labour time for gold production then so did the value of money as priced in other commodities a sharp fall in gold s production time and thus a fall in its value would lead to a sharp rise in the prices of other commodities eg spain s gold from latin america in the 16th century and vice versa the next stage in the nature of money was the use of paper or fiat currencies fixed to the price of gold the gold exchange standard and then finally to the stage of fiat currencies or credit money but contrary to the view of mmt or the chartalists this does not change the role or nature of money in a capitalist economy its value is still tied to the snlt in capitalist accumulation in other words commodity money has contains value while non commodity money represents reflects value and because of this both can measure the value of any other commodities and express it in price form modern states are clearly crucial to the reproduction of money and the system in which it circulates but their power over money is quite limited and as schumpeter said and marx would have said the limits are clearest in determining the value of money the mint can print any numbers on its bills and coins but cannot decide what those numbers refer to that is determined by countless price setting decisions by mainly private firms reacting strategically to the structure of costs and demand they face in competition with other firms this makes the value of state backed money unstable actually this is acknowledged by the chartalist theory according to it the main mechanism by which the state provides value to fiat money is by imposing tax liabilities on its citizenry and proclaiming that it will accept only a certain thing whatever that may be as money to settle those tax liabilities but randall wray one of most active writers in this tradition admits that if the tax system breaks down the value of money would quickly fall toward zero 4 indeed when the creditworthiness of the state is seriously questioned the value of national currencies collapses and demand shifts to real commodities such as gold as a genuine hoard for storing value the gold price skyrocketed with the start of the current financial crisis in 2007 and another large scale rise was propelled in early 2010 when the debt crisis of the southern euro countries aggravated the situation policy conclusions i often hear various mmters saying that money can be created out of nothing 5 bank money does not exist as a result of economic activity they argue instead bank money creates economic activity the money for a bank loan does not exist until we the customers apply for credit 6 the short reply to this slogan is yes the state can create money but it cannot set its price or value the price of money will eventually be decided by the movement of capital as fixed by socially necessary labour time if a central bank prints money or deposits credits with the state accounts that gives the state the money it needs to launch programmes for jobs infrastructure etc without taxation or the issuing of bonds this is the policy conclusion of the mmt it is the way out of the capitalist crisis caused by a slump in private sector production the mmt and chartalists propose that private sector investment be replaced or added to by government investment paid for by the creation of money out of thin air but this money will lose its value if it does not bear any relation to value created by the productive sectors of the capitalist economy which determine the snlt and still dominate the economy instead the result will be rising prices and or falling profitability that will eventually choke off production in the private sector unless the mmt proponents are then prepared to move to a marxist policy conclusion namely the appropriation of the finance sector and the commanding heights of the productive sector through public ownership and a plan of production thus curbing or ending the law of value in the economy the policy of government spending through unlimited money creation will fail as far as i can tell mmt exponents studiously avoid and ignore such a policy conclusion perhaps because like proudhon they misunderstand the reality of capitalism preferring tricks of circulation or perhaps because they actually oppose the abolition of the capitalist mode of production of course none of this has been tested in real life as mmt policy has never been implemented nor for that matter has marxist policy in a modern economy so we do not know if inflation would explode from creating money indefinitely to fund investment programmes mmt people say monetising the deficit would be ended once full employment is reached but that begs the question of whether the private sector in an economy can be subjected to the fine manipulation of central bank and state policy history has shown that it is not and there is no way governments can control the capitalist production process and prices of production in such a finely managed way even leading mmt man bill mitchell is aware of this risk as he put it in his blog think about an economy that is returning from a recession and growing strongly budget deficits could still be expanding in this situation which would make them obviously pro cyclical but we would still conclude the fiscal strategy was sound because the growth in net public spending was driving growth and the economy towards full employment even when non government spending growth is positive budget deficits are appropriate if they are supporting the move towards full employment however once the economy reached full employment it would be inappropriate for the government to push nominal aggregate demand more by expanding discretionary spending as it would risk inflation my emphasis 7 it seems that mmt eventually just boils down to offering a theory to justify unrestricted government spending to sustain and or restore full employment that is its task no other this is why it attracts support in the left of the labour movement but this apparent virtue of mmt hides its much greater vice as an obstacle for real change mmt says nothing about why there are convulsions in capitalist accumulation except that the state can reduce or avoid cycles of boom and slump by a judicious use of government spending within a capitalist dominated accumulation process 8 so it has no policy for radical change in the social structure the marxist explanation is the most comprehensive as it integrates money and credit into the capitalist mode of production but also shows that money is not the decisive flaw and that sorting out finance is not enough thus it can explain why the keynesian solutions do not work either to sustain economic prosperity tricks let me refer you to an excellent short account of the history of money by argentine marxist economist rolando astarita 9 astarita has also analysed mmt in several posts on his blog and i shall draw on some of his arguments suffice it to say that to argue that money only arose because the role of the state in pre capitalist economies is not borne out by the facts nevertheless mmt starts with the conviction that it is the state not capitalist commodity relations that establishes the value of money leading mmter randall wray argues the money takes its value not from merchandise but rather from the will of the state to accept it for payment chartalist founder knapp says money is a creature of the law the denomination of means of payment according to the new units of value is a free act of the authority of the state and in modern monetary systems the proclamation is always supreme thus the modern monetary system is an administrative phenomenon and nothing more keynes also backed this chartalist view in his treatise on money keynes says the chartalist or state money was reached when the state assumed the right to declare which account money is to be considered money at a given moment so the money of account especially that in which debts prices and general purchasing power are expressed is the basic concept of the theory of money i do not think it is correct to say that mmt bastardises keynes however on the contrary mmt and keynes are in agreement that money is a product of state creation as the state decides the unit of account for all transactions but deciding the unit of account eg whether dollars or euros is not the same as deciding its value for transactions ie as a measure or store of value mmt supposedly supports the endogenous money approach namely that money is created by the decisions of entrepreneurs to invest or households to spend and from the loans that the banks grant them for that purpose so banks make loans and so create money as issued by the state money is deposited by the receivers of loans and then they pay taxes back to the state according to mmt loans are created by banks and then deposits are destroyed by taxation in that order at a simple level mmt merely describes the way things work with banking and money and this is what many mmters argue all we are doing is saying like it is but mmt goes further it argues that the state creates money in order to receive it for the payment of taxes the state can force taxes out of citizens and can decide the nature of the legal tender that serves for money so money is a product of the state thus mmt has a circuit of money that goes state money others non state entities taxes state money the state injects money into the private sector and that money is then reabsorbed with the collection of taxes according to mmt contrary to what most of us simpletons think issuing money and collecting taxes are not alternatives but actions that merely occur at different times in the same circuit so if a government runs a fiscal deficit and spends more than it receives in taxes the non state sector has a surplus which it can use to invest spend and employ more the state deficit can thus be financed by creating more money taxes are not needed to finance state spending but to generate demand for money to pay taxes but the mmt circuit fails to show what happens with the money that capitalists and households have in mmt m in value can be increased to m purely by state diktat for marx m can only be increased to m if capitalist production takes place to increase value in commodities that are sold for more money this stage is ignored by mmt the mtt circuit starts from the state to the non state sectors and back to the state but this is the wrong way round causally the capitalist circuit starts with the money capitalist and through accumulation and exploitation of labour back to the money capitalist who then pays the state in taxes etc mmt ignores this but it shows that money is not exogenous to capitalist economic activity its value is not controlled by the state mmt creates the illusion that this whole process starts and ends with the government when it really starts within the capitalist sector including the banking system taxes cannot destroy money because taxes logically occur after some level of spending on private output occurs taxes are incurred when the private sector spends and governments decide to use those taxes to mobilise some resources for the state private incomes and spending on resources precede taxes another chartalist pavlina tcher neva writes chartalists argue that since money is a public monopoly the government has at its disposal a direct way to determine its value remember that for knapp the payments with currency measure a certain number of units of value for example if the state required that in order to obtain a high powered money unit a person must provide one hour of work then the money would be worth exactly one hour of work as a monopoly issuer of the currency the state can determine what the currency will be worth by establishing the terms in which the high powered money is obtained 10 tcherneva s policy of state exogenous pricing is pretty similar to the views of 19th century utopian socialist john gray who reckoned that by issuing bonds that were exogenously priced to represent working time so economies could deliver growth and full employment11 a view that marx criticised where mmt differs from keynesian type fiscal deficit spending is that its proponents see government deficits as permanent in order to drive the economy up and achieve full employment of resources in this way the state becomes the employer of last resort indeed the mmt exponents claim that unemployment can indeed be solved within capitalism so there is no need to change the social formations based on private capital all that is needed is for politicians and economists to recognise that state spending financed by money creation can sustain full employment mmt proponent tcherneva writes chartalists propose a policy of full employment in which the state exogenously establishes an important price for the economy which in turn serves as an anchor for all other prices this proposal is based on the recognition that the state does not face operational financial constraints that unemployment is a result of restricting the issuance of currency and that the state can exercise an exogenous pricing ironic this policy conclusion is rather ironic it leads to a view that full employment can be achieved by the exogenous issuance of currency at a fixed price and yet mmt is prominent in its rejection of the monetarist argument that an exogenous increase in the quantity of money will lead to a boost in economic activity it seems that mmt also has an exogenous theory of money as cullen roche an orthodox keynesian put it mmt tries to reinvent the wheel and argue that it is the government s fault and implicitly the rest of society s fault that you can t find a job mmt gets the causality backwards here by starting with the state and working out roche goes on the proper causality is that private resources necessarily precede taxes without a highly productive revenue generating private sector there is nothing special about the assets created by a government and it is literally impossible for these assets to remain valuable we create equity when we produce real goods and services or increase the market value of our assets relative to their liabilities via productive output it is completely illogical and beyond silly to argue that one can just print equity from thin air government debt is logically a liability of the society that creates it in the aggregate government debt is a liability that must be financed by the productive output of that society 12 some deny that mmt exponents reckon that money can be created out of thin air this is a distortion of mmt they say apparently the real argument of mmt is that government spending can finance itself by raising economic activity and thus more taxes well british tax expert economist richard murphy is definitely a supporter of mmt he expounded that mmt first says governments can make money out of thin air at will mmt then says all government spending is in fact funded by money created in this way created by central banks on the government s behalf mmt logically argues as a consequence that there is no such thing as tax and spend when considering the activity of the government in the economy there can only be spend and tax 13 similarly stephanie kelton is currently the most followed mmt economist she argues that governments can expand spending to whatever level necessary to achieve full use of productive resources in an economy by state money because such spending is self financing money only has value if there is value in production to back it government spending cannot create that value indeed some government spending can destroy value armaments etc productive value is what gives money credibility a productive private sector generates the domestic product and income that gives government liabilities credibility in the first place when that credibility is not there then trust in the state s currency can disappear fast as we see in venezuela or zimbabwe and even turkey right now to quote cullen roche again productive output must by necessity precede taxes in this sense it is proper to say that productive output drives money and if productive output collapses then there is no quantity of men with guns that can force people to pay taxes so the important point here is that a government is indeed constrained in its spending it is constrained by the quantity and quality of its private sector s productive output and the quantity and quality of income that the private sector can create is the amount of income that constrains the government s ability to spend 14 this is keynesian terminology but if we alter the words income or output to value we can get the point in marxist terms marx s theory of money concurs with the endogenous approach in so far that it is the capitalist sector that creates the demand for money to act as a means of exchange and a store of value banks make loans and create deposits not vice versa indeed marx s theory of money is more consistently endogenous than mmt because it recognises the primacy of the capitalist accumulation process with banks and markets in deciding the value of money not any exogenous role of the state as astarita puts it the fundamental difference between the marxist approach to money and the chartalist approach revolves around this single point in marx s conception money can only be understood as a social relation in the chartalist approach it is an artifice in which essential social determinations are missing it sweeps under the carpet the centrality of productive work and the exploitation of work the true basis on which capitalist society is based 15 the state cannot establish at will the value of the money that is issued for the very simple reason that in a capitalist economy it is not dominant and all powerful capitalist companies banks and institutions rule and they make decisions on the basis of profit and profitability as a result they endogenously drive the value of commodities and money marx s law of value says value is anchored around the socially necessary labour time involved in the overall production of commodities goods and services ie by the average productivity of labour the technologies and intensity of work the state cannot overcome or ignore this reality michael roberts blogs at notes 1 see 2 j schumpeter history of economic analysis london 1954 3 4 5 www themeister co uk economics

venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths fake news as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about regime change because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its backyard but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empire s evil hands in venezuela their but claims that venezuela specifically presidents chavez and now maduro are not blameless in their economic chaos this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitant because they have no clue whom to support in this antagonistic us attempt for regime change for example one alternative news article starts it is true that some of venezuela s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian government s socialist command economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european union bingo with such a low blow beginning the uninformed reader is already primed to discount much of the interference by washington and its minions some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicolás maduro a dictator when in fact there is hardly any country farther away from a dictatorship than venezuela in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 venezuela had another 25 fully democratic elections of which 6 took place in the last year and a half they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator and instead they support the real illegitimate never elected us cia trained and appointed juan guaidó former president carter once said of all the elections he and his institute observed the ones in venezuela were by far the most transparent and democratic ones by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries despite this evidence washington paid and corrupted anglozionist msm are screaming and spreading lies election fraud and nicolás maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine he has to go such lies are repeated ad nauseam in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry the same zionists who control the media also control the western money machines i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies that s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found that 86 of all venezuelans including from the opposition want no interference by the us and her puppet allies but want to remain a sovereign state deciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped the western propaganda machine which is the western controlled media in venezuela they control 90 of the news in venezuela but he didn t and doesn t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the media even if the media are really nothing more than abject western lie machine presstitutes mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down which any dictator of which there are now many in latin america take your pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala honduras would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about régime change the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup d état was defeated the revolution will not be televised but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts because venezuela imports close to 90 of her food and medication still today and most of it from the us both chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuela s dollar dependency last week washington confiscated about us 23 billion of venezuela s reserve money in us banks blocked them from use by the legitimate maduro government and instead handed them to their us appointed puppet never elected president juan guaidó he is now able to use venezuela s money in his us eu and lima group supported shadow government will he dare i don t think so however he has already invited us petrol companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever hear of juan guaidó before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise the bank of england withheld 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan reserve gold refusing to respond to the maduro government s request to return the gold to caracas both cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft because that s what it is what the us is doing stealing other countries money that was deposited in good faith in their banks in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for humanitarian aid as the un suggested prompted by the us this so called humanitarian aid has everywhere in the world only served to infiltrate foreign and destabilizing elements into countries just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary system s suicide coffin it sends an ever clearer signal to the rest of the world to those that haven t noticed yet the anglozionist empire cannot i repeat cannot be trusted ever and the european union is intrinsically and vassalically linked to the washington rogue state not to be trusted either there is virtually no circumstance under which a country s assets in western foreign lands as bank deposits or foreign investments are safe it will prompt a move away from the dollar system away from the western also entirely privately owned swft international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted indeed the russia and china and much of the sco shanghai organization cooperation members are no longer dealing in us dollars but in their own currencies we are talking about half the world s population broke free from the dollar hegemony europe has started a half assed attempt to circumvent the dollar and swift system for dealing with iran europe s special purpose vehicle or spv is called instex short for instrument in support of trade exchanges it is a project of germany france and the uk suspiciously chaired by the latter to be endorsed by all 28 eu members it aims in a first instance at shipping humanitarian aid to iran similarly to venezuela iran s foreign minister javad zarif after learning about the details considered the conditions of instex as insulting and rejected any dealings with europe under this system iran he said does not need humanitarian aid not from europe not from anybody in the meantime what was to be expected has already happened the trump administration issued a stern warning of sanctions to the eu if they would attempt to deal with iran outside of the dollar system europe is likely caving in as they always do back in venezuela the ned national endowment for democracy the extended arm of the cia has for the last two decades trained funded and infiltrated traitor agents into venezuela with the goal to assist the opposition to foment unrest to carry out assassinations and other false flags and to simply create chaos and unrest however some of these agents are also lodged in venezuela s financial institutions as the fifth column where they sabotage often with threats any economic policies that could rescue venezuela from its economic predicament in june 2017 i was privileged to be a member of an economic advisory team to mr maduro during three days of intense discussions with government a number of potential short medium and long term solutions emerged they were well received by mr maduro and his economic team what became of these recommendations well maybe there are strong foreign directed forces at play to prevent their implementation clearly any accusation that the maduro government may bear the blame for some of the economic chaos have to be vigorously rejected mr maduro has very little space to maneuver the economy other than what he is already doing his actions are severely limited by the ever stronger squeeze by western claws with or without venezuela s new crypto currency the oil based petro the venezuelan economy including a major proportion of her imports is strongly linked to the us dollar with military threats and sanctions left and right there is little that the government can do in the immediate future to become autonomous yes russia and especially china will most likely help with balance of payment support loans with investments in the oil industry to ease venezuela s us dollar debt burden and vamp up oil production and in the medium and longer run they may also help boost venezuela s agricultural sector towards 100 food self sufficiency what is the real reason you may ask behind trump s intense coup d état attempt aka bolton pompeo and elliott abrams the regime change envoy or the diabolical troika s killer mission is it oil and other natural riches like gold coltan diamonds and many more rare minerals venezuela with some 301 000 mmbbl billions of barrels of known reserves has about 12 more hydrocarbon reserves than saudi arabia shipping from the gulf to texas refineries takes 40 45 days and the risk of passing through the iran controlled strait of hormuz delivering oil from venezuela to texas takes some 2 4 days is it that venezuela committed a mortal sin when circumventing the petro dollar when trading her hydrocarbons notably with china and russia in other currencies like the gold convertible yuan remember saddam hussein and muamar gadhafi attempted similar dollar escaping actions and look what it brought them the us dollar hegemony depends very much on oil and gas trade in us dollars as per an agreement of the seventies between the us and saudi arabia head of opec is it that washington cannot tolerate any socialist or socialist leaning country in its backyard cuba and nicaragua beware is venezuela a crucial stepping stone to fully dominate latin america and her resources and hence a step closer to full power dominance of the world or all of the above i believe it s all of the above with a strong accent on venezuela s abandoning the us dollar as hydrocarbon trading currency putting the dollar hegemony even more at risk once the dollar ceases to be the main reserve currency the us economy will slowly collapse what it is already doing twenty years ago the us dollar dominated world reserve coffers with about 90 today that proportion has sunk to less than 60 the dollar is rapidly being replaced by other currencies notably the chinese yuan now let s cut to the chase it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in the us by cia as venezuela s new interim president confiscating venezuela s reserve assets in new york and london stopping importing petrol from venezuela and punishing anybody who imports venezuelan oil except of course russia and china the might of the us stops short of interfering in these non dollar deals with these and more ridiculous actions and military threats washington is actually not only isolating itself but is accelerating the fall of the us economy ever more countries are seeking alternative ways of doing business with currencies and monetary systems other than the dollar based fraudulent swift and eventually they will succeed all they need to do is joining the china russia sco system of transfer in their local currencies and the currencies of the eastern sco block and dedollarization is moving a step further ahead dedollarization is the key to the end of the us dollar hegemony of the us economic supremacy the arrogant trump plus the impunity of the unfettered diabolical and outright dumb bolton pompeo abrams approach of military threats and intimidations may just make venezuela the straw that breaks the empire s back

impact of each line item was calculated using avista corp s statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent see item h below for further discussion of our effective tax rate b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to the following a decrease in electric revenue related to the federal income tax law changes the above decrease was partially offset by increases in retail electric rates due to general rate increases in idaho and washington customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue during 2018 and the pre tax benefit under the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington decreased from a 1 0 million pre tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2017 to a 0 5 million pre tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2018 the pre tax benefit increased from 4 6 million for the full year 2017 to 6 1 million for the full year 2018 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to the following a decrease in natural gas revenue related to the federal income tax law changes the above decrease was partially offset by general rate increases in washington idaho and oregon and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in 2018 d other operating expenses decreased for the fourth quarter of 2018 but increased for the full year 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily due to decreases in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance costs primarily related to the timing of expenses for the full year 2018 there were increases in generation and distribution operating costs e transaction costs were 1 1 million pre tax for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 6 million pre tax for the fourth quarter of 2017 transaction costs for the full year 2018 were 3 7 million pre tax compared to 14 6 million pre tax for the full year 2017 the transaction costs decreased for the fourth quarter and full year because 2018 consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2017 included consulting banking fees legal fees and employee time none of the transaction costs are being passed through to customers f depreciation and amortization increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 due to additional outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017 h during the fourth quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was 15 8 percent compared to 53 1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and it was 16 0 percent for the full year 2018 compared to 41 7 percent for 2017 the effective tax rate decreased during 2018 primarily due to federal income tax law changes which were enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 which lowered the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent additionally during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the federal tax law changes we revalued deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal income tax rate which resulted in a 10 2 million adjustment to income tax expense in 2017 of this income tax expense amount 7 5 million related to avista utilities and 2 7 million related to our other businesses reflected in j below i ael p earnings decreased slightly for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous expenses as well as a decrease in sales volumes to residential and commercial customers primarily during the fourth quarter of 2018 j losses at our other businesses decreased during 2018 as 2017 included a one time tax expense in the fourth quarter from revaluing deferred taxes to the new tax rate of 21 percent as a result of federal income tax law changes this was partially offset by increased expenses associated with a renovation project in 2018 impairment losses and an increase in equity method losses on our investments non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents our operating revenues resource costs and resulting utility margin pre tax and after tax for the fourth quarter

196 198 045 661 151 a income taxes were calculated using avista corp s statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent liquidity and capital resources 2018 liquidity transactions we have a 400 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 as of dec 31 2018 we had 199 million of available liquidity under this committed line of credit we also had 25 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 during 2018 we issued 375 million of long term debt in the form of first mortgage bonds 2019 liquidity expectations in january 2019 we received the 103 million termination fee from hydro one for the purpose of reimbursing our transaction costs including the related income taxes of 51 million incurred from 2017 to 2019 the balance of the termination fee will be used for general corporate purposes and reduces our need for external financing after consideration of the net termination fee received from hydro one in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures avista utilities capital expenditures were 419 million for 2018 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to be about 405 million for 2019 ael p s capital expenditures were 6 million for 2018 and we expect ael p s capital expenditures to be approximately 9 million for 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory that will showcase the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is initiating its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs due in part to the on going regulatory proceedings for the hydro one transaction we elected not to file any general rate cases during 2018 so the commissions could focus on the merger proceedings while we received a base rate increase effective january 1 2019 in idaho which was related to a rate plan approved by the idaho public utilities commission in 2017 we have not received base rate relief in oregon since november 1 2017 and have not received base rate relief in washington since may 1 2018 during 2017 and 2018 we continued to invest in our utility infrastructure to maintain and enhance our system however only limited portions of these costs are reflected in our current rates to customers as such we will experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 due to the delay in general rate case filings and our continued investment in utility infrastructure we plan to file general rate cases in washington idaho and oregon during the first half of 2019 with requested effective dates in early 2020 to begin remedying the regulatory lag going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 and then our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 this assumes timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2019 earnings guidance range encompasses unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2019 guidance range includes regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 105 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 5 percent in 2019 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 2 72 to 2 86 per diluted share for 2019 this includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 90 percent customer 10 percent company sharing band which is expected to add approximately 0 07 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the year for 2019 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 09 to 0 13 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year we expect the other businesses to be between a loss of 0 03 and a loss of 0 01 per diluted share which includes costs associated with exploring strategic opportunities our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions dispositions until the effects are known and certain note we will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on feb 8 2019 at 10 30 a m et to discuss this news release the call will be available at 888 771

not blockchain gene s follow 11 min read feb 9 2019 listen share just a little over 10 years ago on january 3rd 2009 satoshi nakamoto created the genesis block of bitcoin this was the beginning of a story which promised to uproot the world create the new economy and relegate existing banks to the sidelines the 10 year anniversary is a good milestone to reflect on the promise mosaic the first internet browser was created in 1993 and signified the beginning of the consumer internet 10 years later we had giants like yahoo google amazon ebay yahoo s capitalization was 20b in 2003 google was a big deal and just a year away from the 23b ipo where are all the yahoos and googles of blockchain today technically blockchain is a distributed ledger a distributed database of cryptographically signed transactions in more common terms it s like a ledger or an accounting book which is maintained by multiple independent accountants instead of a single one multiple independent agents agree on common terms of record keeping each one makes records independently then they compare the books and decide which sequence of records is the correct one today we re still in the centralized world of a single agent keeping track of all the transactions the reason why blockchain has failed to change it is the higher cost of doing business the new way in the centralized world there is just one agent and one book the agent adds the record to the book and that s it let s say the cost of this operation is 1 in the decentralized world there are many agents each with a personal book if there are 1000 agents then each one adds the record to the book paying 1 collectively they pay 1000 but that s not all the records are now made but they may differ between the agents the agents collectively have to reconcile them the problem gets complicated because some of the agents may cheat by failing to add records or by adding wrong ones blockchain makes finding the agreement possible when less than half of the agents cheat the extra cost or reconciliation is hard to quantify but in our example it s expected to be greater than 1000 thus the total cost of a distributed transaction is some thousands of dollars vs just 1 for a centralized one more formally if the cost of a single transaction is equal to one then the same transaction will cost n x n if carried out by n agents every agent does the transaction once 1 n n then all the agents have to reconcile the records some non negative function x dependent on n consequently a distributed transaction always and with no exceptions is more expensive than a centralized one n x n 1 this is the fundamental reason why blockchain has found no mainstream applications why blockchain there are three broad categories of blockchain applications today i illegal transactions illegal trades by definition are not protected by the law it s reasonable to expect that the law will also try to prosecute participants of an illegal transaction consequently illegal transactions with a trusted third party are dangerous and expensive the trusted third party takes hard to calculate risks and demands exorbitant premium for it cryptocurrencies solve this problem by eliminating the single point of excessive risk all parties share the risk more or less equally even though the distributed transaction is still technically more expensive than a centralized one the business cost of risk offsets the difference this category contains the likes of the silk road money laundering tax evasion circumvention of currency controls the largest case of illegal cryptocurrency use today is moving capital out of china prc instituted stringent currency controls it s exceedingly difficult to move money out of china cryptocurrencies solve the problem 1 first people buy electricity and crypto mining equipment domestically paying in local currency yuan 2 then they use the equipment to create the cryptocoins called mining 3 finally they sell the coins in the states or eu effectively converting yuans to dollars and euros interestingly this use case makes sense even if mining costs exceed the value of produced cryptocurrency the difference is just the price of moving the capital ii legal transactions ineffective or illegal business blockchain is invariably more expensive than a centralized transaction with a trusted third party nonetheless it s frequently used despite the ineffectiveness in this case the ineffectiveness is compensated in other ways initial coin offerings icos are in this category these are the crypto currency version of the stock market initial public offerings ipos the business models of ico companies are usually bogus in those rare cases when the model is workable it s still less efficient than it could have been without the blockchain on the other hand if the company were to choose a traditional ipo instead of an ico the inefficient or outright fraudulent business model would likely become obvious the ipo would cost a lot more because of regulatory requirements aimed at protecting the investors would bring a lot less money or even fail and the owners would have to release some control of the company because they were to sell the company shares to summarize an ico costs a lot less than an ipo brings more money has no regulatory oversight and does not dilute ownership wins for the company owners on all counts why does it bring more money first and foremost it s speculative frenzy desire to make money fast to gamble and win it s hodl it s the same reason ponzi schemes are so popular some people just want a shortcut to riches blockchain is hyped beyond belief people want to catch the train to wealth or so they see it as a perfect example a british company did nothing but added the word blockchain to its name and saw its shares surge 394 the second reason is the lack or regulatory oversight which enables investments from people who have no business of making such risky bets there are known cases of people taking home equity loans and maxing out credit cards to buy bitcoin the third reason is money laundering and yes this category contains your favorite ico if you have one the distinction between an ico and a ponzi scheme is often weak to none this category also contains all the attempts by companies like ibm maersk ing to build blockchain solutions blockchain is the future we are the thought leaders we must be on the forefront of blockchain revolution ibm lists over 300 blockchain solutions on their website their only problem is that all of them are less efficient than the centralized alternatives can one use an ipad to hammer nails sure it s just cheaper and more convenient with a hammer this is fomo fear of missing out nothing useful will come out of these projects anything they can do with the blockchain others can do easier cheaper without it blockchain is a handicap not an advantage you must be wrong you could say these are large respectable companies i m sure they know where to invest not necessarily a large company often has a large gap between the people making the investment decision and the people understanding the problem the former don t always listen to the latter the people doing the work may be happy to just take the money and shut up even if they know that the project they work on will fail the executive leadership may realize that the blockchain is useless and still have a team assigned to it because the shareholders expect them to or due to an off chance that there is something there pascal s wager iii selling picks and shovels during the california gold rush of the 1840s and 1850s the most money was made by selling shovels and other mining tools rather than by mining gold this history is repeating money is made by crypto exchanges including the cases of we are so sorry we got hacked and lost all your money suckers nvidia makers of mining equipment etc this business is reasonable except for the mentioned cases of outright fraud but derivative from categories i and ii above what about smart contracts when parties enter an agreement they codify their rights and responsibilities in the contract if one party refuses to honor the terms the other party may use some enforcement mechanism to compel the execution the enforcement could be in the form of legal system for lawful contracts or it could be the thugs in case of illegal dealing in other words if one refuses to honor the contract his property freedom and ultimately life could be threatened by men with guns be that the police or the mob smart contracts are expected to offer some form of enforcement too otherwise they have no value in reality they offer protection only if the entire transaction happens on the blockchain and even then the protection is very weak smart contract loses enforcement power as soon as the value is moved off blockchain even worse enforcement is mostly impossible even when the value is retained on the blockchain let s say alice entered a smart contract with bob under the contract alice made a loan to bob in the amount of 1 eth with the interest rate of 10 per month in the end of the month the smart contract automatically deducts 1 1 eth from bob s wallet and deposits it to alice s wallet the trouble starts when the contract fails to execute because bob s wallet has no money in it what are alice s options alice may go to court but then what s the use of the smart contract a dumb contract on a napkin would work better alice may have asked bob to deposit the money in an escrow account but why would bob take the loan if he can t use the the money alice may try to roll back all bob s transactions to return the 1 eth unfortunately bob spent all the money on a space station in adam online why would adam online return the money if it fulfilled the obligations ok let s assume that bob spent the money on an ico and all the tokens and cryptocurrency are still on the blockchain shall alice try to roll back the 1 million transactions in which bob s coins have participated and we are not even discussing the interest in the amount of 0 1 eth money is expected to be fungible meaning 100 is 100 regardless of its history cryptocurrency stops being fungible if smart contracts are allowed to roll back subsequent transactions one has to consider all the contracts which the particular coin has participated in potentially considering the entire history of smart contracts on the blockchain for every transaction given that the smart contract becomes unenforceable if the value is moved off of blockchain someone somewhere used a coin to buy a pizza the whole thing becomes unusable in practice smart contracts are used only for token sales during and post ico it s useful in the ico because one side of the transaction takes no risk at all the tokens sold in the ico have zero incremental value to the seller the contract is fulfilled once this zero value goods is exchanged for the non zero value goods consequently the risk of non delivery of tokens or the risk of tokens having less value than expected is negligible after all if you are selling grains of sand for 1 each you are unlikely to fail at delivering the sand to the buyer right but fiat money is just paper not really government issued fiat money has a distinct feature which no cryptocurrency possesses government money has the final consumer states usually collect taxes taxes are almost always nominated in local currency that means local currency must be purchased at least for tax payments taxes create demand for the currency and as long as the state collects taxes the currency value cannot go to absolute zero talking about us dollars usa collects roughly 25 of the gdp in taxes all us workers spend 25 of their workday supporting the dollar nothing comparable exists in the cryptocurrency world the number of currencies is limited by the number of sovereign states on earth give or take a few the number of cryptocurrencies is unlimited each human on earth may have a personal cryptocurrency each bacteria living in the gut of each person on earth may have a personal cryptocurrency each atom comprising each bacteria living in the gut of each person on earth may have a personal cryptocurrency the supply of cryptocurrencies is literally unlimited while the demand is limited by the economic activity in the long term the demand is constrained to category i illegal transactions unlimited supply limited demand miscellania did you forget your password to online banking no biggie call the bank and have it restored in the worst case you have to go to the bank and show your id did you forget the password to your crypto wallet no biggie call the actually no it s kind of a biggie your cryptomoney is gone forever no recourse you gave your buddy john 1000 writing a few words on a napkin as a contract if john does not return the money you go to court win and impound john s 1998 chevy impala see above what happens if you give john 10 eth with a smart contract did you remember to kiss your money goodbye how much is it going to cost you to send 100k to uganda if you send 30 btc it s going to cost you just 10 well not really indeed if you just send 30 btc from one wallet to another you will pay 10 for the transaction but if you want to spend the money you have to convert btc to ugandan shilling first and that s going to cost you a lot more than transferring the money by non blockchain means lightning network will solve all problems it may solve some but you won t like the solution remember the formula n x n 1 lightning network solves the inefficiency by reducing the n in other words it makes the transaction cheaper by making the system less distributed then wouldn t it make sense to take the next logical step and reduce the inefficiency to the maximum extent possible by leaving just one agent the centralized system wins what to expect from the blockchain in the future the most common use case of blockchain cryptocurrencies is not likely to disappear but is going to be used almost exclusively for conducting illegal transactions i e category i bitcoin value won t go to zero but the number of transactions will be lower than today and the btc will be less valuable particularly if demand for capital transfer out of china diminishes due to changes in economy there the cost of mining will consistently exceed the value of produced coins nonetheless the mining will continue because the users will see the excessive cost of mining just as a cost of doing business the frequency of 51 attacks will grow they won t succeed in actually stealing the money because converting crypto to fiat will become more difficult but they will create enough of a nuisance to erode the value of cryptocurrencies further it cannot be ruled out that someone will find a truly distributed use case for blockchain something outside of the three categories described here for instance tron foundation recently bought bittorrent inc actually called rainberry inc there are lots of parallels between blockchain and torrents both being inherently distributed there is a small chance that tron will find some non trivial cross product of blockchain with torrents on the other hand it s more likely that they will just add crypto payments to torrents essentially enabling paid downloads of pirated content which is category i again no hope in sight for blockchain only pain and darkness

laying the foundations of good fiscal management in the arab world as prepared for delivery good morning sabah al khair i am delighted to be back in dubai this city of tomorrow where you its economic leaders are dedicated to realizing the vision of a better tomorrow this vision is predicated on prosperity that is shared by all benefiting the poor and the middle class citizens and immigrants alike and opportunities that are open to all including women it is a vision of fairness over cronyism and partiality and of trust that government policy is oriented toward the common good this is a big vision but as sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum once said the bigger your vision the bigger your achievement will be we cannot let fear keep us small we have to be brave to be big as you know so well fiscal policy plays a vital role in creating and nurturing this vision of sustainable and inclusive growth especially as encapsulated in the sustainable development goals this is because we need fiscal space for spending on health education social protection and public investment all key priorities in this region this is why i wanted to come back to the arab fiscal forum my fourth time now in past years i talked in detail about fiscal policy the spending and revenue measures needed to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth this year i want to go one level deeper into the foundations of fiscal policy and good fiscal management because without a stable foundation even the best policies can flounder without a stable foundation fiscal policy will lack credibility in this vein i will address two key pillars of good fiscal management i strong fiscal frameworks and ii good governance and transparency prelude global and regional context before i do this let me say a few words about the broader economic context bearing on fiscal policy in the region unfortunately the region has yet to fully recover from the global financial crisis and other big economic dislocations over the past decade among oil importers growth has picked up but it is still below pre crisis levels fiscal deficits remain high and public debt has risen rapidly from 64 percent of gdp in 2008 to 85 percent of gdp a decade later public debt now exceeds 90 percent of gdp in nearly half of these countries the oil exporters have not fully recovered from the dramatic oil price shock of 2014 modest growth continues but the outlook is highly uncertain reflecting in part the need for countries to shift rapidly toward renewable energy over the new few decades in line with the paris agreement with revenues down fiscal deficits are only slowly declining despite significant reforms on both the spending and revenue sides including the introduction of vat and excise taxes this has led to a sharp increase in public debt from 13 percent of gdp in 2013 to 33 percent in 2018 at this juncture the global expansion is weakening and risks are rising just a few weeks ago we released our revised forecasts we now think that the global economy will grow by 3 5 percent this year 0 2 percentage points below what we expected in october and risks are up given escalating trade tensions and tightening financial conditions unsurprisingly a weaker global environment has knock on effects on the region through a variety of channels trade remittances capital flows commodity prices and financing conditions the bottom line the economic path ahead for the region is challenging this makes the task of fiscal policy that much harder which in turn makes it even more important to build strong foundations to anchor fiscal policy 1 fiscal frameworks the first building block of this foundation is a good fiscal framework by this i mean the set of laws institutional arrangements and procedures needed to achieve a country s fiscal policy objectives such a framework allows governments to map out budgets over the medium term in a way that reflects clear consistent and credible goals there is scope to improve fiscal frameworks in this region some of the weaknesses are short termism and insufficient credibility on short termism given that inclusive and sustainable growth is an inherently medium term goal fiscal policy needs a medium term orientation focusing on the immediate horizon makes it harder to implement critical but longer term reforms in such areas as tackling high public wage bills designing effective social protection systems and getting rid of harmful fuel subsidies short termism implies that fiscal policy amplifies rather than tames the waves of booms and busts making it more difficult to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth turning to fiscal credibility i am referring to such factors as large amounts of spending kept off budget and poor risk management across the region it is common for sovereign wealth funds to directly finance projects bypassing the normal budget process and state owned enterprises in some countries have high levels of borrowing again outside of the budget addressing these fiscal risks would not only enhance budget credibility and transparency but would help keep a lid on corruption budgetary credibility also calls for better risk management with a more comprehensive budget based on realistic forecasts the good news is that numerous countries are already strengthening their fiscal frameworks many with imf assistance just to give some examples saudi arabia kuwait uae sudan qatar and lebanon have all set up macro fiscal units a useful first step in strengthening the fiscal framework algeria has recently adopted a new budget law with a strong medium term orientation and bahrain has introduced a fiscal program designed to achieve balance over the medium term mauritania morocco jordan and lebanon are making great progress with medium term public investment planning and execution egypt now publishes a fiscal risk statement with its budget and produces an internal in year budget risk assessment the uae too is rolling out a fiscal risk management project with the imf s help and will produce its first fiscal stress test this year there is scope for further improvement perhaps the oil exporters could follow the example of other resource rich countries such as chile and norway in using fiscal rules to protect key priorities such as social spending from commodity price volatility strong fiscal frameworks have other important benefits they form the basis for sound debt management they also allow for better coordination between fiscal and monetary policies so that the two arms of macroeconomic management work together not at cross purposes 2 good governance and transparency let me now turn to the second pillar of good fiscal management good governance and transparency in this context governance refers to the institutional frameworks and practices of the public sector strong institutions are crucial for legitimacy for fostering a clearer understanding of policy objectives among citizens enhancing their voice and generating buy in for fiscal policy on the other hand as many of you have said weak institutions imply a weak policy foundation that could crack and crumble because there is inadequate legitimacy and public accountability even worse these cracks could also let corruption creep in and you know so well this is social poison it feeds discord disengagement and disillusionment especially among the young the word corruption after all comes from latin root for rotting breaking apart disintegration and the word in arabic fasad also connotes this idea of rotting or coming undone corruption is the great disruptor of fiscal policy without trust in the fairness of the tax system it becomes harder to raise the revenue needed for critical spending on health education and social protection and governments might be tempted to favor white elephant projects instead of investments in people and productive potential add this up and we have a recipe for unsustainable fiscal policy combined with social discord this a global issue relevant for large and small countries advanced and low income economies and the public and private sectors given this it is no surprise that imf research found that weak governance and corruption are associated with significantly lower growth investment fdi and tax revenues and higher inequality and exclusion specifically we found that improving on an index of corruption and governance by moving from the bottom quarter to the mean is associated with an increase in the investment to gdp ratio of 1 5 2 percentage points and a bump up in annual gdp per capita growth by half a percentage point or more we will have more analysis in the upcoming fiscal monitor which will be devoted to the topic of the fiscal costs of corruption and the role of fiscal institutions what is the solution to weak governance and corruption in the fiscal domain it calls for heightened fiscal transparency shining a light on all aspects of the budget and the public accounts this would provide a more accurate picture of the fiscal position and prospects the long term costs and benefits of any policy changes and the potential fiscal risks that might throw them off course this region has some room for improvement here we know that these kinds of reforms pay off take the case of georgia for example until 2003 it was seen as one of the most corrupt countries in the world but after that it reformed its institutions and cracked down on corruption this along with tax reform led to immediate improvements tax revenues increased from 12 percent of gdp in 2003 to 25 percent of gdp in 2008 as taxpayers had greater faith in the fairness of the system i should note that the imf has been stepping up its engagement in the area of governance and corruption last year we put in place a new framework predicated on a more systematic evenhanded effective and candid engagement on these issues with member countries we will be reaching out to leaders in this region to discuss how we can work together to implement this framework with better governance we can replace the disintegration of corruption with the integration of all into the productive economy we can replace fasad with islah reforms to set things right to reconcile people with one another conclusion let me wrap up i have argued this morning that good fiscal policy requires good institutional foundations and solid foundations in areas such as fiscal frameworks and governance give citizens confidence that fiscal policy serves the good of all not just the wealthy or the well connected let me end with some wise words attributed to the great ibn khaldun he who finds a new path is a pathfinder even if the trail has to be found again by others and he who walks far ahead of his contemporaries is a leader you are the pathfinders the leaders the visionaries we hope that we can give useful guidance but we look to you to find the right path to make this vision a reality thank you shukran more specifically those gains are associated with moving from the 25th percentile to the 50th percentile in an index on corruption and governance
washington ap in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers josh boak juliet linderman colleen long ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen knickmeyer jill colvin and lolita c baldor in washington and elliot spagat

washington as vice president mike pence left and house speaker nancy pelosi look on in trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own doug mills the new york times via ap pool the associated press washington ap in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights advertisement jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected advertisement in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama advertisement ___ economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example advertisement ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of

saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month advertisement the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the

washington ap in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by

by thorsten polleit in his manifesto of the communist party 1848 published together with frederick engels karl marx calls for measures by which he means despotic inroads on the rights of property which would be unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production that is bringing about socialism communism marx s measure number five reads centralisation of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly this is a rather perspicacious postulation especially as at the time when marx formulated it precious metals gold and silver in particular served as money as is well known the quantity of gold and silver cannot be increased at will as a result the quantity of credit in terms of lending and borrowing money balances cannot easily be expanded according to political expediency however marx might have fantasized already what would be possible once the state is put in a position where it can create money through credit expansion where it has usurped and monopolized the production of money long before marx the english churchman and historian thomas fuller had elaborately expressed the power of money money is the sinew of love as well as war the origins of modern central banking the idea of central banking has a long history for instance the swedish central bank the sveriges riksbank was founded in 1668 and the english central bank the bank of england was formed in 1694 the fraudulent operations of such institutions came to light soon at the latest with the writing of the british economist david ricardo in his 1809 essay the high price of bullion he pointed out that it was the increase in the quantity of money in the form of banknotes not backed by gold that caused a general rise in prices an effect we know as price inflation unfortunately however the political economic insight that central banks holding the money production monopoly would misuse their power time and again engage in cronyism and cause an anti social debasement of the currency has not to this very day sufficed to discredit the monstrous idea of central banking it seems that as far as monetary affairs are concerned marx s concept of dialectical materialism has made quite an impression what is appears to form peoples consciousness not vice versa this has certainly helped in creating central bank marxism on a world wide scale cutting the last ties with commodity money on 15 august 1971 marx s vision became true the us administration single handedly terminated the redeemability of the us dollar into physical gold and so gold the currency of the civilized world was officially demonetized through this coup de main in the united states of america as well as all other countries in this world an unbacked paper money or fiat money system was established since then all currencies around the globe represent fiat currencies representing money creation by circulation credit expansion not backed by real savings or deposits monopolized by central banks the fiat money system the creation of money through circulation credit expansion has brought about a new kind of debt slavery on a grand scale consumers corporations and of course governments too have become highly dependent on central banks continuously churning out ever greater amounts of credit and money provided at ever lower interest rates in numerous countries central banks have de facto become the real centers of power their monetary policy decisions effectively determine the weal and woe of economies and whole societies by issuing fiat currencies created out of thin air a rather small clique of central bankers together with their staffers causes to borrow from friedrich nietzsche a revaluation of values chronic monetary inflation for instance discourages savings running into ever greater amounts of debt gets cultivated by central banks downward manipulation of the interest rate the future needs get debased compared to present needs the favoring of a sort of monetary deep state comes at the expense of demolishing civil and entrepreneurial liberties a supranational central bank in europe central bank marxism has accomplished a rather astounding feat 19 nation states with a total of around 337 million people have given up their right to self determination in monetary affairs submitting to the monetary policy dictate of a supra national central bank entirely beyond effective parliamentary control that issues a single fiat currency the euro while central bank marxism has been reasonably successful in europe however its true spearhead has always been the us central bank the federal reserve fed today s world depends on the fiat us dollar issued by the fed more than ever effectively all other major currencies are built upon the greenback and it is the fed that determines the credit and liquidity conditions in international financial markets it effectively presides over a world central bank cartel which if it is allowed to continue unimpededly will eventually steer and control the world economy through its unassailable money production monopoly effectively removing one of the most critical roadblocks against unrestricted state tyranny ideas have consequences so those favoring a free society can only hope that something will get in the way of central bank marxism this is by no means impossible socialism communism is not the inevitable destiny of social life and historical evolution as marxists would like to make us believe what truly matters are ideas or theories if you will as ideas whatever their specific content wherever they come from whether they are right or wrong underlie and drive human action ludwig von mises was acutely aware of this indisputable insight human society is an issue of the mind social co operation must first be conceived then willed then realized in action it is ideas that make history not the material productive forces those nebulous and mystical schemata of the materialist conception of history if we could overcome the idea of socialism if humanity could be brought to recognize the social necessity of private ownership of the means of production then socialism would have to leave the stage that is the only thing that counts against the backdrop of mises s words one may add once people understand that marxism and all its particular forms of socialism does not guarantee a higher living standard and that it does make a better or more just and reasonable world it would usher in the end of central banking and fiat money in other words whether or not central bank marxism and fiat money will prevail or be thrown out of the window or flushed down the drain will be determined by the outcome of the battle of ideas so there remains reason for hope this was originally posted on mises org like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here

costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers josh boak juliet linderman colleen long ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen knickmeyer jill colvin and lolita c baldor in washington and elliot spagat

reading or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story washington ap in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay

washington ap â in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs â something which almost everyone said was impossible to do â state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps â state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy â the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world â state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom â a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states â state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office â state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions â state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs â state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years â a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages â state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before â state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives â state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america â state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally â state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 â or two thirds â did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years â state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods â and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars â state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement â or usmca â will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa â state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour â that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years â state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible â state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 â and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains â and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases â serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded â state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery â state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data

stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods â and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars â state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement â or usmca â will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa â state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour â that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years â state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible â state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 â and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains â and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases â serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded â state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery â state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers josh boak juliet linderman colleen long ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen knickmeyer jill colvin

kuala lumpur the ringgitâ s upward momentum after reaching a seven month high on friday is expected to hit a snag next week as renewed concerns loom over the global markets amid the ongoing us china trade war a dealer said despite earlier reports that the white house would send a representative to beijing to discuss trade matters us president donald trump reportedly said he was less optimistic on a trade discussion as he would not meet chinese president xi jinping â this has led to renewed concerns among investors as it involves the two economic powerhouses whose trade deadline is on march 1 â he told bernama on dec 1 2018 both china and the us agreed to a ceasefire in their trade war after high stakes talks at the group of 20 summit in argentina between trump and xi the talks have led to the 90 day trade truce including no escalating tariffs on jan 1 2019 the dealer said that if there were no new consensus reached between the two nations on the trade deals businesses would face the consequences because the us would raise tariffs on us 200 billion rm813 billion worth of chinese imports to 25 per cent from the current 10 per cent the trade dispute has also caused the oil price to take a dip today as economic concerns loom in both countries â in the us trumpâ s poll numbers have taken a dive recently while china is under pressure as its gross domestic product grew at its slowest pace in decades which is a worrying sign of an economic slowdown â he said the ringgit is expected to trade between 4 07 and 4 08 next week due to external factors as well as profit taking by investors as at 6pm friday the benchmark brent crude was at us 61 59 rm250 per barrel compared with us 62 69 rm255 per barrel yesterday during the holiday shortened trading week the ringgit finished at a seven month high against the us dollar at 4 0670 0720 today compared with 4 0930 0980 on thursday last week due to higher commodity prices meanwhile the local currency was traded higher against other major currencies the local market was closed on tuesday and wednesday for the lunar new near the ringgit appreciated versus the singapore dollar to 2 9988 9029 on friday from 3 0409 0450 on thursday last week inched up against the japanese yen to 3 7023 7079 from 3 7699 7749 and rose against the euro to 4 6059 6124 from 4 7000 0070 however the local currency rose vis a vis the british pound to 5 2590 2667 from 5 3688 3758 previously as the latter currency is now being influenced by the ongoing brexit development â bernama
us business confidence is starting to crack actions speak louder than words that s why surveys asking people what they think about the economy aren t always useful their actions might not match their words of course attitudes are important because they guide our decisions even though we don t act on them consistently not everyone s decisions have equal impact though business owners and ceos have more influence because they make bigger decisions whether to create new jobs raise wages buy new equipment and so on the economy has done okay the last few years largely because business leaders were confident in the future we ll know the end is coming when they lose that confidence and they re starting to disturbing trend the national federation of independent business a small business advocacy group compiles a monthly optimism index this is valuable data because small businesses drive job creation and they are usually well informed about local conditions here s a graph showing the nfib index from january 2000 to december 2018 graphic nfib that big leap i circled in red is november 2016 the nfib index climbed more in that one month than it fell during the entire 2008 2009 financial crisis strange not really consider who is in this survey it s not a random sample of small business owners nfib surveys its own members who are indeed business owners but they also voluntarily joined an organization that advocates lower taxes deregulation and smaller government so of course donald trump s election win made them happy he had promised many things they wanted more significant is that they stayed happy and optimistic and grew even more so the nfib index hit an all time high in august 2018 then it fell in each of the next four months those declines are small and still leave the index higher than it was before the 2016 election but it s starting to look like a downtrend given the lack of other positive news it s hard to imagine what would make the nfib index turn higher from here data reveals more disturbing signs capital spending plans are back where they were in november 2016 only 16 of respondents expect to see better business conditions six months from now just 24 said now is a good time to expand their businesses as noted sentiment data is imprecise none of this means an imminent breakdown but it is concerning especially when larger studies show similar attitudes weak spots the federal reserve s beige book is a collection of anecdotes assembled eight times a year by regional fed staff who talk to their business contacts it s not infallible but it s good for general impressions here is how the latest beige book summarized its findings outlooks generally remained positive but many districts reported that contacts had become less optimistic in response to increased financial market volatility rising short term interest rates falling energy prices and elevated trade and political uncertainty so here again we see optimism starting to fade let s break down the factors they mention increased financial market volatility the stock market was falling as fed staff collected these impressions in some cases a lot that has an impact on sentiment rising short term interest rates borrowing is getting more expensive as the fed tightens policy that makes business financing more expensive falling energy prices this one is a bit surprising lower fuel prices help some businesses those who ship products for instance but hurt those involved in energy production the fed appears to be saying that damage to the energy industry outweighs the benefit of falling fuel prices to others elevated trade and political uncertainty this isn t new so i don t get why they call it elevated in any case the developing trade conflict does make planning difficult for many businesses why make long term investments when you have no idea what tariffs will pop up in the next year the regional summaries showed generally good news but also a few weak spots some examples new york holiday season sales were a bit on the sluggish side but still up from a year ago philadelphia further slowing occurred among service sectors and some real estate activity declined richmond manufacturers reported a decline in shipments and orders and faced higher input costs due to tariffs kansas city district agricultural conditions remained weak dallas a broad based deceleration was seen across manufacturing services retail and energy ominously the dallas fed added this to its summary outlooks were markedly less optimistic than the previous report they saw something new a notable change just in the last few weeks maybe weak oil prices are hurting texas more than we think but it s not just business confidence cracking consumers are noticing it too this month the university of michigan s consumer sentiment index slid to its lowest point since october 2016 and for similar reasons the survey s chief economist described it this way the loss was due to a host of issues including the partial government shutdown the impact of tariffs instabilities in financial markets the global slowdown and the lack of clarity about monetary policies notably consumers showed lower confidence for both present conditions and future expectations people know something is wrong their behavior and economic decisions will increasingly reflect it worry lines none of this is reason to panic it does however support what other data has been telling us us economic growth is slowing that s due to both cyclical factors and the fed s rate hikes and quantitative tightening the problem is that businesses are now far more leveraged than they were the last time we entered recession it won t take much to push default rates higher which will lead to layoffs and lower consumer spending loan defaults are a problem for lenders as well as borrowers you can t get blood from a turnip banks and bondholders who assumed they would get bailed out again may learn that conditions have changed some economists think recessions are a kind of necessary evil because they purge excesses i disagree with that perspective evil is never necessary but it does exist we may see

ceo christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thank you dan and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our year end 2018 call before i begin i d like to take a moment to thank our employees and those of other utilities who worked during the extremely cold weather to keep our communities safe and warm during the recent polar vortex our nuclear plants ran at nearly 100 during the week the investment reliability made on our system made a difference and we had more than 500 crews out restoring service to customers in temperatures that reached a negative 23 degrees without including the wind chill factor i ll start on slide five 2018 was a great year for exelon and its operating companies we executed on our strategy and delivered on our commitments to customers communities and shareholders we are in a solid position to continue to bring value to our stakeholders in 2019 our financial performance was strong full year gaap earnings were 2 07 per share and adjusted operating earnings were 3 12 per share well ahead of the original guidance range joe will walk through the details later in the call last year we shared our goals for 2018 and i m proud to report we re able to meet those commitments utility and generation operations saw ph improvements in multiple categories i ll get to those details in a few minutes last year exelon utilities invested more than 5 5 billion in capital primarily in infrastructure and technology to provide a premier customer experience as well as improve reliability and resiliency which resulted in higher customer satisfaction scores we are also effective on the regulatory front completing 13 distribution and transmission cases in 2018 phi was able to reach constructive settlements in all of its cases including pepco and in maryland pepco in maryland and dc for the first time since 1980s we share the benefit of the tax reform with our 10 million customers returning more than 675 million on an annual basis working with stakeholders to realize timely and fair regulatory outcomes helped us fund future investments in our system and continue to improve customer service on the policy front the second and seventh circuit court upheld the zec program in new york and illinois although the plaintiffs have appealed to the supreme court we expect these rulings to stand new jersey enacted the zec legislation which will start this spring and we re still focused on preserving nuclear plants in pennsylvania the public utility commission of texas adopted the changes to the ordc curve earlier this year we are awaiting a decision from ferc on pjm s fast start proposal and on pjm s capacity market reform and pjm is expected to file its reserve market reforms in coming months these policies each in their own way better compensate our zero carbon nuclear fleet for the value it provides by addressing flaws in the existing energy and capacity markets we are growing our dividend by 5 each year through 2020 with the board raising the annual dividend to 1 45 per share on monday we are dedicated to corporate responsibility and supporting the communities we serve is an important part of who we are and what we do as part of our partnership with the un heforshe initiative we held an inaugural stem initiative leadership academies ph for teenagers in chicago and washington dc 95 girls participated in a week long program designed to empower them through mentorship and creating opportunities to learn about stems we are expanding this program in 2019 and 2018 was another record year for employee volunteerism and contributions our employees volunteered more than 240 000 hours last year on average seven hours per employee and donated nearly 13 million in addition exelon donated more than 51 million to charitable organizations throughout our footprint we are committed to providing a diverse and inclusive environment for our 34 000 employees we were named a best company for diversity by forbes black enterprise magazine diversityinc and the human rights campaign we are also recognized for environmental stewardship we received a score of a minus on both the cdp climate change and water surveys the highest by any utility for each we were named to the dow jones sustainability index for the 13th year in a row and we had a series of commitments for the 2018 we delivered on the task is for 2019 is beginning as big and i will cover those at the end of the call on slide six we show the impact that exelon management model has had on our utility operations each of our utilities have materially improved their operations since the merger with constellation or phi to put this chart in perspective comed has improved its overall reliability 60 since 2012 the hard work of our employees and the ability to share best practices across a large platform is paying off in 2018 all four of our utilities ended up in top quartile for saifi or outage frequency performance with comed at top decile and phi matching its best performance on record each utility achieved top quartile on caidi or outage duration except peco which missed top quartile by only one minute bge and comed performed in top decile bge and peco had top decile performance in gas odor response for the sixth consecutive year and phi delivered top decile performance for the second year in a row this level of reliability just demonstrates that the investments we are making in our system are yielding positive results for our customers but we still have more to do to confront climate change and our customer demands customer satisfaction was top quartile at least three of the four utilities comed bge and phi had the best performance on record in call center satisfaction comed and phi scored in top decile for service level and bge and phi had their best performance on record our utilities in the mid atlantic operated extremely well in the face of record breaking rainfall dc saw more than 5 5 feet of rain baltimore 6 feet and philadelphia 8 feet of rain during last year our safety metrics improved over the year as a result of the actions we re taking to correct course we will continue to focus on improving our performance in this area turning to our competitive business on slide seven our generation fleet performed very well in 2018 providing an abundance of clean electricity that our country needs in fact exelon generated 1 out of every 9 clean megawatts in the united states more than twice as many as any other generator our best in class nuclear fleet operated very well last year our capacity factor was 94 6 exceeding 94 for the third year in a row in five out of the last six years we generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2018 our average outage duration was 21 days a new exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average exelon power s gas and hydro dispatch match 98 1 and wind and solar capture 96 1 were better than plan in october we acquired the everett lng import facility and in december we received a cost of service order from ferc on mystic units 8 and 9 which together will allow us to provide fuel security in new england market through may of 2024 our mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in january and february of last year at constellation our c i operating metrics remain strong 78 customer renewal rates average customer duration of more than six years and power contract terms of 24 months on average we continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continued focus on cost is helping us support operating margins constellation s strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers that relationship is more than just power and gas but is built on constellation s unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals now i ll turn it over to joe joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer thank you chris and good morning everyone today i will cover our 2018 results annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance starting with slide number eight we had another strong year for the fourth quarter we earned 0 16 per share on a gaap basis and 0 58 per share on a non gaap basis for the full year we earned 3 12 per share on a non gaap basis which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of 3 05 to 3 20 per share and 0 07 above our original midpoint exelon utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues with the early resolution of rate cases at pepco and favorable weather this was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms exgen performed in line with guidance realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018 including higher allocated transmission costs overall we delivered well in our financial commitments turning to slide nine it shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes across our utilities we received final orders in eight distribution cases we reached settlements in six of the cases at peco delmarva delaware on the electric and gas sides delmarva maryland and pepco maryland in dc which is the first time we ve had settlements at pepco since the 1980s additionally comed received 100 of its ask for the second year in a row and finally in early january the maryland psc approved 78 of the ask in bge s gas distribution case our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions on slide 10 we compare the 2018 trailing 12 month blended transmission and distribution earned roes to 2017 our constructive rate case results and the roll off of the fas 109 charge drove the improved earns earned returns this year we are encouraged by phi s ongoing improvement with earned roes improving by 70 basis points to 140 basis points exelon utilities earned a combined 9 7 roe up year over year we remain focused on achieving our utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned roes at phi and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities we expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9 to 10 range in 2019 on slide 11 we roll forward our outlook for utility capex and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022 since the merger with phi in 2016 we have invested more than 16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly 23 billion over the next four years as chris said these investments are improving our system reliability service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future as a reminder the capex budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects as we move through time we generally find more investment due to additional system needs when we compare our 2019 to 2021 capex outlook versus the same period last year we plan to invest an additional 1 5 billion of capex for the benefit of our customers this additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility comed since the phi merger we have added nearly 6 billion in rate base across the utilities over the next four years we will grow our rate base 7 8 annually to 50 7 billion adding 13 1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of comed without paying a premium issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7 4 growth we projected last year as a reminder the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers these support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital where we do not have these mechanisms we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools in the appendix we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on slide 22 as you turn to slide 12 we continue to forecast strong utility less holding company eps growth of 6 to 8 even for the elevated even from the elevated 2018 starting point where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 0 09 per share compared to last year the outlook for 2019 to 2021 has improved with all bands increasing by 0 05 per share the durability of our industry leading earnings growth reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and growing environmental goals along with concerted efforts to manage costs and are focused on modest customer bill in place ph on slide 13 we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company there is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure open gross margin increased 50 million due to improving spark spreads at ercot as well as higher prices at new york zone a and nihub which were offset by our hedges during the quarter we executed 50 million in power new business in 2020 open gross margin is up 150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions given our hedged positions and execution of 100 million of new business total gross margin increased by 50 million since last quarter we are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down 250 million compared to 2020 the decline reflects lower power prices in pjm and ercot plus lower capacity revenues in new england and pjm our power and non power new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with prior years i should point out that these disclosures are based on 12 31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ordc curve changes in texas we ve remained behind our ratable hedging program in all years we ended the year 9 to 12 behind ratable in 2019 and 8 to 11 behind ratable in 2020 while we re 0 02 to 0 05 2 to 5 behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges our open market length is primarily concentrated in the midwest and texas we are comfortable maintaining a more open position given our balance sheet slide 14 shows our o m and capital outlook at generation our o m forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the everett marine terminal that serves our mystic units like others the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns resulting in increased costs going forward in total these updates have added 75 million in o m costs or about a 6 0 06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021 however we even with these cost pressures we expect to see a 1 annual decline in o m over the next four years compared to our previous disclosure our 2019 to 2021 capex is up modestly in 2019 due to timing delays for our medway plant and some retail customer site at solos ph in 2020 with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices where we have hedged with collars we continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of the fleet slide 15 rolls forward exchange available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022 we expect cumulative available cash flow to be 7 8 billion which is 200 million higher than our previous four year outlook we will use the available cash flow from exgen to primarily fund the increased utility investment pay down debt and cover a small portion of the dividends we will invest approximately 600 million in growth capital which is primarily customer cited solar projects at constellation and as i mentioned the completion of the west medway plant in new england this quarter as i mentioned earlier we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities as a result we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities from exgen by 700 million to a range of 4 billion to 4 4 billion we will use between 300 million and 500 million of exgen s free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities as the utilities continue to grow exgen s portion of the dividend decreases even as the dividend itself grows finally we ve planned to retire between 2 2 billion and 2 8 billion of debt with our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets we felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reduction to instead support the higher value adding and needed investments at our utilities a big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity market this remains a differentiated advantage to our peers moving on to slide 16 we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings we are comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for ffo to debt and well above the agency s downgrade threshold as you are aware exelon and its operating companies are on creditwatch positive at both s p and fitch looking at exgen we are well ahead of our debt to ebitda target of 3 times in 2019 we expect to be at 2 4 times debt to ebitda and 1 9 times debt to ebitda on a recourse basis we are actively following the pge bankruptcy process pge is the sole offtaker of our antelope valley solar ranch or avsr facility which was funded by exelon s doe loans and project financing that are non recourse to exelon we along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with pg e recently received a ferc order affirming the commission s role to approve any modifications to existing ppas which pg e has challenged in the bankruptcy court we will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of avsr and the role what assets like ours have in california s clean energy future from an earnings perspective avsr provides 0 03 per share to exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics given the non recourse financials finally i will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on slide 17 we are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of 3 to 3 30 per share growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our consumers last year s completed rate cases and improvements in phi s roes the decline in generation earnings is a combination of normalized illinois zec revenues as we recognized 0 11 of 2017 illinois zec revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices which are partially offset by increased zec revenues in new jersey and new york as well as fewer planned nuclear outages as you think about our 2019 earnings the most notable new updates include the 0 05 per share increase to our utility earnings bands the 0 02 to 0 03 of pension expense at exgen due to worse than expected plan performance in 2018 as well as a roughly 0 03 per share drag from the recent everett lng facility acquisition which represents a negative near term impact but is a positive value driver in future with the mystic cost of service contract beginning in 2022 these impacts are reflected in our o m and other expense data in the appendix we expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of 0 80 to 0 90 per share more detail on the year over year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on slide 61 i will now turn the call back to chris for his closing comments christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks joe turning to slide 18 i want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019 we will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our generation fleet safely and reliably we will meet or exceed our financial commitments including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment grade rating at the utilities we will prudently and effectively deploy 5 3 billion of capital to benefit our customers and we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9 to 10 earned roes across exelon utility families by year end building upon successes in delaware dc maryland and pennsylvania we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and our commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers at generation a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that fail to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits as you know we plan to retire tmi later this year and as a reminder all of the dresden and portions of the braidwood and byron plants did not clear last year s pjm auction we will continue to engage with stakeholders on stay policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level we will support pjm price formation changes like fast start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected ferc order on pjm capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for zero emitting nuclear plants we ll continue to grow our dividend at 5 annually through 2020 and we ll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve being a good corporate citizen for our customers communities and employees is key to who we are finally turning to slide 19 i will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders we have updated some of the numbers but the proposal proposition remains the same we ll continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting a 7 8 growth rate base growth and a 6 to 8 earnings growth through 2022 rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory we ll continue to use free cash flow from exgen to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend we will continue to optimize value of our genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generation fleet selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen to load match strategy at constellation we will sustain strong investment grade metrics and we ll grow the dividend annually at 5 through 2020 the strategy underpins this value proposition is effective and providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders we are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside though needed policy and market reforms are required we are very confident about the prospects for exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at exelon with that operator we can now open the call up to questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question this morning comes from greg gordon from evercore isi please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks good morning christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey greg greg gordon evercore isi analyst on the utility side of the business obviously a pretty meaningful increase in capital opportunities across the entire set of companies what s the expected bill impact of the increase in spending and as you look at the long term and how much more sort of customer experience enhancing types of capital programs are you contemplating that are also affordable as we think about the opportunity not just this year to execute on this new capital plan but to continue to evolve your plan anne r pramaggiore senior executive vice president chief executive officer of exelon utilities good morning greg it s anne pramaggiore i ll start with your first question we when put our capital plans together our inaudible we look at what the needs are in front of us we challenge ourselves on o m and if you can look at the o m trajectory it s about 0 3 increase over that four year period and we always look at affordability and we ve got eight bills on the distribution rate side and four of them excuse me three of them are roughly flat over that period that we ve showed you four of them are trending less than inflation and one of them will come in right at inflation and that s a combination of managing our o m and also our energy efficiency programs which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here so that s basically what we re looking at in terms of affordability the other question that we ask ourselves is are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates and we so we ve been looking hard at the low income side and a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low income programs along with it so that s what we re looking at in terms of affordability bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income in terms of looking forward we think about investment in really three buckets one is reliability and resiliency just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems the safety of our systems and as the economy changes and we ve got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system how do you ensure that reliable and resilient the second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation we ve got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we ll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile so thinking about sensors on the system artificial intelligence distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to six to eight cycles that sort of thing and then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system to in expectation of that kind of shift so those are the areas that we think about and look at we watch our stakeholders very closely we re starting to see legislation and policy come out of dc in december big piece of policy there pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in january and so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they re directing us greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks i ll ask one more and then go to the back of the queue joe i know that we re focused on the strong 18 performance in the 19 outlook but i think it s sort of deja vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout sort of the guidance pieces for exgen and once again we see as we have in prior years pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of play is for the earnings outlook for exgen based on the algebra you gave in the deck it s 0 20 headwind on total gross margin probably 0 05 to offset through to o m but still much like we ve seen in past updates that are sort of two years forward but it looks like today significant pressures on exgen margin what can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think we roll into real time over the next two years joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer greg i appreciate the question the first thing is we re not in the business of giving eps guidance beyond the prompt year but having said that i think as you ve seen through time our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period when you look at the gross margin in 21 versus 20 there s a the two big drivers very simply are as you mentioned one is the backward dated price curve and obviously for us the biggest impact is that nihub and west hub and jim could talk for a while about what we re doing we are aggressively managing our portfolio you see that we re behind our ratable plan actual spot prices last year obviously we re very very strong and then secondly kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as pjm and others and so i don t think the story has been fully written there and obviously we have a very large open position the second piece of it is it s driven really by capacity and some of it s on in new england where the prices were lower year over year and in pjm where we had lower volumes clear year over year but from my lens i think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility and hedging is less hedging is an example of that and through time we ve continued to improve our earnings and we ll continue to work hard to do that in 21 christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay thank you guys christopher m crane president chief executive officer director just to add on i mean just to summarize that you ve got low minimal liquidity in those years those 21 out 20 and 21 and out you build the liquidity as you go through the prompt year into the next year and you see the curves come up and that s been the pattern until we get these market reforms in if it s moving the plants in illinois or some amount of plants in illinois to frr so we can get better capacity treatment that matches the states environmental needs or if you look at price formation that s working through you look at reserve curves being revised there s a lot of activity going so that s why we re keeping more of an open position we believe the market will strengthen thank you chris thanks operator our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research please go ahead steve fleishman wolfe research analyst hi good morning christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hi steve fleishman wolfe research analyst couple of market structure questions hi chris the and first of all in pennsylvania in terms of any chance to get a zec could you give us an update there and when would something have to happen for you to not have to close tmi christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so the activities that kathleen is leading with the other operating companies in pennsylvania are promising we have some strong support the it s going to have to move this spring we have to order a core by may and we ve let the stakeholders know that so if we can get this through in that period of time we will be able to save the unit short of that we ll be beyond a return at the end of may steve fleishman wolfe research analyst and is there any sense on what the value targeted value of the zec is going to be in pennsylvania kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy i ll take that one steve this is kathleen i think that is subject to discussions that are ongoing among the lawmakers now so we don t have an estimate for you on how the program will look how it will be priced those are all discussions that are progressing as chris said with some promising outlook steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and then just and then just have to ask and probably hard to answer just any better sense of where ferc may come out on the capacity market reforms is there any hints of the changes at ferc and what happened with the new england auction and things like that where you might have a better idea kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy i ll take that one as well i don t think we have a better idea than we did on our last call of how they re going to come out clearly there has been some delay in the schedule and i think that s a function of the transition effort the unfortunate death of the chairman integrating a new commissioner commissioner inaudible announcing her plans for retirement so while they have been able to get out a number of important orders others have lagged and the capacity market order is among them so i think as we re doing as you re doing looking at the tea leaves and trying to make an estimate of where we think things will land but we really have no signal yet from then from them as to when we ll see their final decision in that docket steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay great thank you christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hi good morning can you hear me christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah hear you well good morning julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent congratulations again wanted to follow up a little bit more on the utility side can you walk through some of the more specific dynamics for the longer date the 2022 ph year i mean that s just a pretty impressive jump at the end there what exact dynamics and also what kind of earned roes are you embedding out there within the ranges i mean just perhaps once you get to 22 what are we going to be talking about with respect to the position of the utilities and also rate case schedule et cetera anne r pramaggiore senior executive vice president chief executive officer of exelon utilities hi julien it s anne pramaggiore let me start by giving you a sense of what the investment patterns look like and what s sort of i think driving the trending that you re seeing and then between joe and i will talk about the roes so we are there s a couple of things that are happening there one of the one of the things that we ve done in the last year so we ve gone through an accelerated our gas main replacement program so we ve moved them from 30 years to 20 years and so you re seeing an acceleration of the gas investment so that s one of the pieces that you re seeing trending there one of the things that we re doing at peco now is we re looking at some material condition upgrades but we re also doing a program to upgrade for 4 kv feeders to 12 kv feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system you just can t put that stuff on the kind of some of the some of the feeders we ve got in place right now so that s one of the areas we re looking at another program at peco is really enhancing the underground replacement program again our underground cable program again some material condition work i think you are pretty familiar with the most of the phi work we ve got dc plug that we re getting started and we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in december at bg e we ve got some new ev investment that s coming through after the order that just came out of that commission so some additional capital investment there at comed we re expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place we re doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments we ve got about a program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that s about 900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our it systems to get ready for again more flexible dynamic grids so those are i think some of the things that you re looking at that s driving that capital trend joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer and julian i would julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst and just to jump on quickly in there what s driving that uptick from 2021 to 2022 though like what are the dynamics there specifically that s a pretty big jump joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer so julien it s joe good morning specifically to your question the jump from 2021 to 2022 anne went through each of the utilities the investment that we re making into the rate base that compounding of that investment is one component of it the second thing is we have a rate case in peco in 21 that has benefits in 22 and then the third thing is there s additional spending under the formula rate at comed so those three things together get you to that outcome julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent and then turning back to the other side of the business real quickly can you talk a little bit about everett and the contribution on the exgen side as you see that their cost of service kick in in 22 and then also how do you think about that asset align to even if mystic were ultimately to be pulled out of the market how do you think about the lng asset itself contributing kind of more structurally then joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think first of all julien we acquired the marine terminal in q4 as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the acquisition is earnings negative from 2019 to 21 driven by the increased o m amounts with about half of the 75 million increase in o m or 0 03 a share being driven by everett the gross margin in from the facility is included in our open gross margin calculation in our hedge disclosure and isn t really material what i would say is obviously the mystic cost of service contract arrangement begins in 2022 and it effectively the whole thing is bundled and it becomes accretive at that time we committed we had a capacity commitment prior to the last auction and we were committed to honoring that commitment and one way to do that was to acquire the facility we were also very clear to your question about how would we treat it in the future we re very clear that with any type of asset that isn t economically viable we re going to work for solutions and we d just try to make that asset viable but i think you ve seen with our financial discipline that when we ve had to we ve taken the stance of making the necessary change julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent thank you very much all congrats again christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit suisse please go ahead michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hi michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey just to be clear on the roes at phi you re saying that for all of 2019 you ll be at the 9 to 10 range or are you going to be or is that like a run rate at the end of the year joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer that that will be by the end of the year we will be in that range of 9 to 10 and effectively that will be the trailing 12 month at that time michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you okay and then on the ordc i understand it s a dynamic issue and you re not going to provide a point number on it but is one of the things we ve tried to estimate it ourselves here around 25 million perhaps of improvements for exelon just wondering if that s in the right ballpark of if you can give some kind of kind of hint as to where what kind of impact you see you re thinking this might have on you james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon right and to be clear hi it s jim mchugh michael to be clear we re talking about ercot michael weinstein credit suisse analyst yes james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon okay ercot ordc it is hard to put a pin point number on it the way we re looking at it right now is even before the ordc change we ve been talking about the tighter reserve margins and you ve seen the cdr reports and we re in agreement with where they re coming in now that the the reserve margins for this upcoming summer look like there are somewhere between 7 and 8 so i think with the ordc changes you re just making the likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role and where the summer prices go we ve seen the forward market move up since the end of q3 about 15 for summer on peak over the last month or so it s been more up and down and maybe a little higher but more flattish so i think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there is going to be which to your point is the hard thing to predict it obviously depends on when whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outages or variable wind ph the one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at 9 000 is 1 on the kelly ph atc price it s about 13 or 14 on the summer on peak price so i think what we re going to see the market do is really trade in a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer 15 at a time just by adding an hour or two so to put an estimate on right now is really to say how many hours we think there s going to be but i think the way we like to think about it is increase the likelihood and send the right price signal in times of tight market conditions christopher m crane president chief executive officer director and michael jim is keeping a relatively significant open position and capability to extract value as we see volatility occur both in the forwards for the summer in 19 as well as we ll position ourselves well during that summer period michael weinstein credit suisse analyst thank you very much for the help operator our next question comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners please go ahead shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst hey joe and chris christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey shar shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst so just real quick on the o m profile change post 22 should we kind of assume this is the new normal and then as we re sort of thinking about some of the incremental revenue items that s not within plan that could help mitigate or at least support some of this o m pressures especially as you are closer to 2021 can you provide some color there i mean i think you mentioned mystic is obviously one of it and lng is another one is there sort of anything else we should be thinking about from the revenue offset side joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah the one thing i would say and obviously we haven t given you a forecast of o m 22 and beyond but the one thing i would say and i made the comment in my prepared remarks the debt cost of service agreement at mystic kicks in the middle of 2022 and that would more than that would more than offset those cost of the o m that we show you in 21 so effectively we ve turned into an accretive outcome as i said in my prepared remarks christopher m crane president chief executive officer director and the pension as you know the market for 2018 was not great on equities december was pretty tough we bought we got some of that portion of that back in january so we ll watch the pension we ll watch the pension investments the interest rate and the return on the fund is what will drive the other half of what we saw the increase on this year so everett and the pension as far as our o m discipline we work through the out years we are far less than 1 all across the company and that s dealing with labor contracts at 2 5 wage increases and other inflation forces so we do have a good plan on continuing to drive efficiency hold cost down and maintain that inflation rate it s much lower at the generating company than utilities but still the utilities are less than 1 shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst okay got it and then just lastly chris that s helpful and then as we are sort of thinking about the exgen gross margin i know we ve talked about in the past maybe taking somewhat of a different approach when it comes to managing the portfolio i e maybe operating some of the units more from a portfolio approach right so like maybe fitzpatrick or nine mile right are we sort of seeing any impact from this in your outlook or is this sort of something you guys are still going through internally and then i guess what i m asking is also beyond fitzpatrick and nine mile is there any sort of things we should be thinking about from taking a more holistic approach to the assets james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon yeah hi it s jim i mean if you re talking about new york i think the way we re thinking about the portfolio in new york is the capacity the zec payment that we receive in new york has somewhat of an offsetting nature as energy prices rise so we re out in the outer years so we re looking to make sure we hedge our portfolio along the lines of where we think that index is going to set as the zec as the zec price sets according to the structure the index structure in the zec so really there is not much of a shift in our strategy i think what we ve been doing is finding opportunities in the nearby year or two on the energy side to understand if we think the market is slightly under priced or slightly overpriced and right now recently we ve seen a pretty strong move in new york prices and we ve been getting some good hedges off in inaudible area to take advantage of those higher new york energy prices shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst well i guess what i m asking is have you seen any synergies for having these two assets so close to each other more from less from a dispatch and hedging but more from taking these systems taking the units and operating them as one so like there s clearly there are some synergies in there for owning these two assets so close to each other right christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah i didn t get your question at first so i m sorry shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst yeah no that s ok christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so the nuclear team is evaluating that what they can do as far as management what they can do as far as warehousing we have looked at combining security plans that s a cost prohibitive item but they re continuing to drive through that there is definitely more synergies that we will be continuing to work on there as we complete the integration and the team has time to work through the regulatory process and the have time to make the investments to make these consolidations shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst perfect and those synergies are incremental to plan christopher m crane president chief executive officer director right they will be if the ones that aren t included now but there are also our initiatives that are under way across the nuclear fleet we re looking at how we centralize warehouses versus having over stock warehouses each site there s a lot of initiatives under way right now to take advantage as technology advances and built into the cost savings number now is an assumption that we centralize engineering since we have much more digital information and we can trend the equipment remotely versus having the engineers in the plant on the site so there s things like that across the fleet that we re working on shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst perfect chris that s what i was trying to get at thanks so much christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from jonathan arnold from deutsche bank please go ahead jonathan arnold from deutsche bank please go ahead christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey jon jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst just a couple of things on the o m at exgen just when you look behind the numbers that obviously you have these new incremental pieces are you still going after the 200 million in additional cost savings christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst it was inaudible services that you shared at eei christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah that s still in the plan we have line of sight on that we will continue and just to reemphasize we re not going off plan on savings or efficiency two factors pension underperformance in the market required us to higher state o m in everett which reverses out and provides greater revenues in the 2022 time frame so these are these are the things we have line of sight of it s not that the efficiency programs have been taking the pedal off of them jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst yes i just wanted to check chris because you re showing it slightly differently so thank you for that christopher m crane president chief executive officer director okay we ll get with you to clarify that jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst and secondly i see you ve removed the disclosures on new england sensitivities and we realize this the mystic contracts out in 2022 but just is that just smallness and to make it simpler or something else going on there joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer no there s really nothing else going on jon so we made a decision to collapse the new england region into open gross margin because with the changes to that facility and the inputs of gas and so on and the associated contract change the volume of our power generation output is falling and then you ve got the gas acquisition of everett that we ve talked about and that would all factor into that everett calculation and you would see changes that were quite variable quarter to quarter most importantly the overall gross margin is very small compared to the total gross margin we provide you in the disclosure jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay thank you and then could i don t know if this is timely or not but chris any update on sort of efforts to engage the legislature in illinois coalition building et cetera i know we did notice the bill that seem to be very renewables only got flouted this week so i was just curious if you have any comments you d like to share on that christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yes it s very very early in the legislative cycle as you can imagine we work within the coalitions within the state on what s needed to continue to advance the environmental stakeholders the customers and sound investments so we have our folks communicating in those coalitions and communicating with the legislative folks premature to say what it looks like at the end of the day but they re at the beginning of the sausage making right now and we ll continue to have productive conversations jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst is the ferc order sort of a prerequisite for actually something happening this year christopher m crane president chief executive officer director not on the not on the utility side and we are looking at other methods on the generation side the ferc order definitely would be helpful to get out in a timely manner but we don t need it you can go to use the current statute and achieve what we think we can do want to do jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay i ll leave at that thank you chris christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our final question comes from praful mehta from citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey praful how are you praful mehta citigroup analyst great thanks for this marathon session so quickly on pjm i guess one last piece that was left for fast start so just wanted to get any color or view on timing of when that will come we ve been waiting for it for a while at this point kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy yeah this is kathleen and i think that s within the scope of what i said earlier on the call unfortunately there are a number of matters that are lagging and that s one of them and i think the transitions at the commission have affected their ability to get big orders out but just going back to the beginning of the fast start docket recall this is something that the ferc ask pjm to file so we continue to feel confident about how it will turn out even if it s going to take a little bit longer than we expected praful mehta citigroup analyst got you fair enough and then slide 15 that s very helpful capital allocation slide that you provide in that if we think about all of these benefits that are potentially coming on the exgen side right with fast start ordc zecs all of them are incremental to the plan how would we think about the allocation given you ve kind of hit your utility investment targets you re hitting your debt reduction targets where does the incremental capital that potentially comes through go in your mind going forward joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer the answer in my mind i think is very similar to what you saw with the plan with the increase at the utilities anne talked about the way she s thinking about the three buckets of investment at our utilities and the benefits to our customers as it relates to those three buckets we would continue to look at ways as we see projects that are beneficial for that we would continue to look at investment there and then i think additionally that increment those incremental dollars continue to provide us operating and strategic flexibility and we ve talked about what that s worth in the sense of our hedging and the opportunity to be more aggressive with that and other things so we re going to continue to work hard to get those and i think it gives us a lot of opportunity praful mehta citigroup analyst got you but share buyback is not one of those that s in the plan right now or contemplated in the plan christopher m crane president chief executive officer director no it s not contemplated in the plan but all investments are bounced ph off a share buyback before they re made praful mehta citigroup analyst got you perfect well i appreciate it guys thank you so much christopher m crane president chief executive officer director well i want to thank everybody all of you for participating today i want to thank you our employees for another good year both operationally and financially so with that we ll close out the call and all have a good weekend operator this does conclude today s

i want to tell you a story a little over 100 years ago textile mills in lawrence like the ones behind us today employed tens of thousands of people and immigrants flocked here from more than 50 countries for a chance to work at the looms lawrence was one of the centers of american industry business was booming the guys at the top were doing great but workers made so little money that families were forced to crowd together in dangerous tenements and live on beans and scraps of bread inside the mills working conditions were horrible advertisement children were forced to operate dangerous equipment workers lost hands arms and legs in the gears of machines one out of every three adult mill workers died by the time they were 25 then on january 11 1912 a group of women who worked right here at the everett mill discovered that the bosses had cut their pay get today in politics a digest of the top political stories from the globe sent to your inbox monday friday enter email sign up and that was it the women said enough is enough they shut down their looms and walked out soon workers walked out at another mill in town then another then another until 20 000 textile workers across lawrence were on strike these workers led by women didn t have much not even a common language nevertheless they persisted they organized they embraced common goals they translated the minutes of their meetings into 25 different languages so that the english and irish workers who had been here for years and the slavic and syrian workers new to america could stand together they hammered out their demands fair wages overtime pay and the right to join a union big business at the time called those demands a threat to the very survival of america and the bosses tried to shut it down they spread rumors and fear about the strikers advertisement one factory owner even paid a guy to plant sticks of dynamite around town so he could frame the workers as a violent mob the mill owners also owned city government which declared martial law and called in the militia some strikers died in violent clashes with the police it was a hard fight families that were already going to bed hungry had to make do with even less they were cold they were under attack but they stuck together and they won higher wages overtime everybody back at work and those workers did more than improve their own lives they changed america within weeks more than a quarter of a million textile workers throughout new england got raises within months massachusetts became the first state in the nation to pass a minimum wage law and today there are no children working in factories we have a national minimum wage and worker safety laws workers get paid overtime and we have a forty hour work week that s right because of workers here in lawrence and all across the country we have weekends the story of lawrence is a story about how real change happens in america it s a story about power our power when we fight together today millions and millions and millions of american families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well connected hard working people are up against a small group that holds far too much power not just in our economy but also in our democracy advertisement like the women of lawrence we are here to say enough is enough we are here to take on a fight that will shape our lives our children s lives and our grandchildren s lives just as surely as the fight that began in these streets more than a century ago because the man in the white house is not the cause of what s broken he s just the latest and most extreme symptom of what s gone wrong in america a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else and so once he s gone we can t pretend that all of this never happened it won t be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration we can t afford to just tinker around the edges a tax credit here a regulation there our fight is for big structural change this is the fight of our lives the fight to build an america where dreams are possible an america that works for everyone i am in that fight all the way and that is why i stand here today to declare that i am a candidate for president of the united states of america the truth is i ve been in this fight for a long time i grew up in oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class when my daddy had a heart attack my family nearly tumbled over the financial cliff but we didn t my mother who was 50 years old and had never worked outside the home walked to sears and got a minimum wage job answering phones advertisement that job saved our house and saved our family i ended up at a commuter college that cost 50 a semester and that is how the daughter of a janitor managed to become a public school teacher a law professor and a united states senator i believe in an america of opportunity i ve spent most of my life studying what happens to families like mine families caught in the squeeze families that go broke and what i found was that year after year the path to economic security had gotten tougher and rockier for working families and even tougher and even rockier for people of color i also found that this wasn t an accident it wasn t inevitable no over the years america s middle class had been deliberately hollowed out and families of color had been systematically discriminated against and denied their chance to build some security it started very quietly the richest and most powerful people in america were rich really rich but they wanted to be even richer regardless of who got hurt so every year bit by bit they lobbied washington and paid off politicians to tilt the system just a little more in their direction and year by year bit by bit more of the wealth and opportunity went to the people at the very top that s how today in the richest country in the history of the world tens of millions of people are struggling just to get by advertisement since the early 1970s adjusted for inflation wages in america have barely budged but the cost of housing has shot up nearly two thirds the cost of college has more than tripled and 40 of americans can t find 400 to cover an emergency that s millions of hard working people in this country whose lives would be turned upside down if the transmission fell out of the car or if somebody got sick and missed a week at work the middle class squeeze is real and millions of families can barely breathe it s not right this disaster has touched every community in america and for communities of color that have stared down structural racism for generations the disaster has hit even harder take home ownership the number one way middle class families build wealth in our country back in 1960 it was legal to discriminate against families of color and the gap between white homeownership rates and black homeownership rates was 27 percentage points that s a lot over time we finally changed the law to prohibit that kind of discrimination and the gap began to close but today the home ownership gap between black and white families is 30 percentage points bigger than it was back in 1960 when housing discrimination was actually legal race matters and we need to say so and we can t be blind to the fact that the rules in our country have been rigged against other people for a long time women lgbtq americans latinos native americans immigrants people with disabilities and we need to call it out but over the course of a generation the rules of our economy have gotten rigged so far in favor of the rich and powerful that everyone else is at risk of being left behind in 1940 90 of kids were destined to do better than their parents did by the 1980s the odds had slipped to 50 50 and now we could be the first generation in american history where more kids do worse than their parents meanwhile the rich and powerful seem to break the rules and pay no price no matter what they do they grow richer and more powerful bailouts for the bankers that cheat tax cuts for the companies that scam subsidies for the corporations that pollute that s what a rigged system looks like too little accountability for the rich and too little opportunity for everyone else when i talk about this some rich guys scream class warfare well let me tell you something these same rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard working people for decades i say it s time to fight back to protect their economic advantages the rich and powerful have rigged our political system as well they ve bought off or bullied politicians in both parties to make sure washington is always on their side some of them have even tried to buy their way into public office so today our government works just great for oil companies and defense contractors great for private prisons great for wall street banks and hedge funds it s just not working for anyone else when it comes to climate change our very existence is at stake but washington refuses to lift a finger without permission from the fossil fuel companies that s dangerous and it s wrong and it isn t just climate change look at any other major issue in america gun violence student loan debt the crushing cost of healthcare mistreatment of our veterans a broken criminal justice system an immigration system that lacks common sense and under this administration lacks a conscience overwhelming majorities of americans want action huge crowds march on washington demanding change letters phone calls protests but nothing happens nothing why because if you don t have money and you don t have connections washington doesn t want to hear from you when government works only for the wealthy and well connected that is corruption plain and simple it s time to fight back corruption is a cancer on our democracy and we will get rid of it only with strong medicine with real structural reform our fight is to change the rules so that our government our economy and our democracy work for everyone and i want to be crystal clear about exactly what i mean when i say that first we need to change the rules to clean up washington end the corruption we all know the trump administration is the most corrupt in living memory but even after trump is gone it won t be enough to do a better job of running a broken system we need to take power in washington away from the wealthy and well connected and put it back in the hands of the people where it belongs that s why i ve proposed the strongest and most comprehensive anti corruption law since watergate some examples shut down the revolving door between wall street and washington end lobbying as we know it and while we re at it ban foreign governments from hiring lobbyists in washington make justices of the united states supreme court follow a basic code of ethics ban members of congress from trading stocks how is that not already illegal and one more make every single candidate for federal office put their taxes online i ve done it everyone should do it that s one root out corruption in washington now two change the rules to put more economic power in the hands of the american people workers and small businesses middle class families and people of color who have been shut out of their chance to build wealth for generations again that requires real structural change right now giant corporations in america have too much power and they roll right over everyone else we need to put power back in the hands of workers make it quick and easy to join a union unions built america s middle class and unions will rebuild america s middle class make american companies accountable for their actions and raise wages by putting workers in those corporate boardrooms where the real decisions are made break up monopolies when they choke off competition take on wall street so that the big banks can never again threaten the security of our economy and when giant corporations and their leaders cheat their customers stomp out their competitors or rob their workers let s prosecute them and one more thing i m tired of hearing that we can t afford to make real investments in child care college and medicare for all can t afford things that help create economic opportunity for families i m tired of hearing that we can t afford to make investments in things like housing and opioid treatment can t afford things that address rural neglect or the legacy of racial discrimination i m tired of hearing what we can t afford because it is just not true we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world of course we can afford these investments but we need a government that makes different choices choices that reflect our values stop handing out enormous tax giveaways to rich people and giant corporations stop refusing to invest in our children stop stalling on spending money real money on infrastructure and clean energy and a green new deal and start asking the people who have gained the most from our country to pay their fair share that includes real tax reform in this country reforms that close loopholes and giveaways to the people at the top and an ultra millionaire tax to make sure rich people start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich so that s one clean up washington that s two change the rules in our economy now three change the rules to strengthen our democracy that starts with a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every american citizen to vote and to have that vote counted and that s just the beginning overturn every single voter suppression rule that racist politicians use to steal votes from people of color outlaw partisan gerrymandering by democrats and republicans and overturn citizens united our democracy is not for sale by the way if we truly believe that then we also need to end the unwritten rule of politics that says anyone who wants to run for office has to start by sucking up to rich donors on wall street and powerful insiders in washington i m opting out of that rule i m not taking a dime of pac money in this campaign i m not taking a single check from a federal lobbyist i m not taking applications from billionaires who want to run a super pac on my behalf and i challenge every other candidate who asks for your vote in this primary to say exactly the same thing it s not just our elections real democracy requires equal justice under law it s not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail while a bank executive who launders money for a drug cartel can get a bonus we need real reform it s not equal justice when for the exact same crimes african americans are more likely than whites to be arrested more likely to be charged more likely to be convicted and more likely to be sentenced yes we need criminal justice reform and we need it now and one more thing we must do to strengthen our democracy we must not allow those with power to weaponize hatred and bigotry to divide us more than 50 years ago dr martin luther king jr went to montgomery and warned us about the danger of division he talked about how bigotry and race baiting are used to keep black americans divided from white americans so that rich americans can keep picking all their pockets that playbook has been around forever whether it s white people against black people straight people against gay people middle class families against new immigrant families the story is the same the rich and powerful use fear to divide us we re done with that bigotry has no place in the oval office this is who we are we come from different backgrounds different religions different languages different experiences we have different dreams we are passionate about different issues and we feel the urgency of this moment in different ways but today we come together ready to raise our voices together until this fight is won our movement won t be divided by our differences it will be united by the values we share we all want a country where everyone not just the wealthy everyone can take care of their families we all want a country where every american not just the ones who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers everyone can participate in democracy where every child can dream big and reach for opportunity and we re all in the fight to build an america that works for everyone this won t be easy there are a lot of people out there with money and power and armies of lobbyists and lawyers people who are prepared to spend more money than you and i could ever dream of trying to stop us from making any of these solutions a reality people who will say it s extreme or radical to demand an america where every family has some economic security and every kid has a real opportunity to succeed i say to them get ready because change is coming faster than you think yeah this kind of fundamental change will be hard a lot of people even some of our friends will tell us it isn t even worth trying but we will not give up let me tell you one last story when i was home with my first baby i got this notion that i would go to law school it was a crazy idea but i persisted eventually i figured out the admissions tests and applications worked out how to pay my tuition and mapped out the 45 minute commute to campus weeks out i had one last thing on my checklist child care my daughter amelia was nearly two years old and i looked everywhere i struck out over and over we were down to the weekend before law school was supposed to start when i finally found a small place with a cheerful teacher nice little play area no funny smells in my price range but the place would only take children who were hmm dependably potty trained i looked over at amelia she was happily pulling toys off the shelf her diaper barely covered by her pink stretchy pants hmmm dependably potty trained i now had five days to potty train an almost two year old all i can say is i stand before you today courtesy of three bags of m ms and a cooperative toddler since that day i ve never let anyone tell me that anything is too hard but oh how they ve tried people said it would be too hard to build an agency that would stop big banks from cheating americans on mortgages and credit cards but we got organized we fought back we persisted and now that consumer agency has forced these banks to refund nearly 12 billion directly to people they cheated when republicans tried to sabotage the agency i came back to massachusetts and then ran against one of them no woman had ever won a senate seat in massachusetts and people said it would be too hard for me to get elected but we got organized we fought back we persisted and now i am the senior senator from the commonwealth of massachusetts so no i am not afraid of a fight not even a hard fight when the women of everett mill walked away from their machines and out into the cold january air all those years ago they knew it wouldn t be easy but they also knew what was at stake for themselves and their families and they weren t going to let anyone tell them it was too hard doubters told the abolitionists it s too hard skeptics told the suffragettes it s too hard cynics told the trust busters it s too hard naysayers told the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement it s just too hard but they all kept right on going and they changed the history of america sure there will be plenty of doubters and cowards and armchair critics this time around but we learned a long time ago that you don t get what you don t fight for we are in this fight for our lives for our children for our planet for our futures and we will not turn back my daddy ended up as a janitor but his little girl got the chance to be a public school teacher a college professor a united states senator and a candidate for president of the united states i am grateful all the way to my bones grateful and determined so here is the promise i make to you today i will fight my heart out so that every kid in america can have the same opportunity i had a fighting chance to build something real i will never give up on you and your future i will never give up on your children and their future i am in this fight all the way it s a long way to election day but our fight starts here and it starts with you it starts with your decision to get involved right now join us on elizabeth warren com help us organize volunteer pitch in five bucks we need everyone in this fight the textile workers here in lawrence more than 100 years ago won their fight because they refused to be divided today we gather on those same streets ready to stand united again this is our moment in history the moment we are called to this is our moment to dream big fight hard and win
u s highlights global central banks have followed the cue set by the fed as they too take a break from tighter monetary policy to assess mounting risks to global growth activity in the u s services sector cooled a bit in january as government funding uncertainty and trade tensions weighed on business sentiment nonetheless non manufacturing activity remained well in expansion territory senior u s trade officials are off to beijing next week to work on a trade deal even as a meeting between the two countries presidents seems unlikely before the march 2nd deadline all eyes will be on washington to avert yet another government shutdown as the temporary funding gap expires on february 15th canadian highlights we received mixed signals this week with household credit growth moderating on the back of an outright decline in consumer credit while the labour market kicked off 2019 with a bang the signal being sent by the credit data deserves attention but is not overly concerning at present a period of household adjustment may moderate economic growth but it also means stronger balance sheets a welcome development the strong labour market including a new record for monthly private sector hiring is encouraging indicating that the household adjustment is taking place against a solid economic backdrop u s central banks have cause for a pause in a week where economic data was sparse partly due to delayed releases as a result of the government shutdown global developments filled in the gap on the heels of the fed s decision last week the bank of england boe and the reserve bank of australia rba both left policy rates unchanged this week the boe cited the likelihood of slower growth due to elevated financial uncertainty on the possibility of a no deal brexit while the rba highlighted trade related downside risks to global growth elsewhere the european commission also significantly reduced its gdp outlook for the euro zone in 2019 and 2020 as it expects growth in the bloc s largest economies to be held in check by global trade tensions the decidedly dovish shift in u s and global central banks statements reflects the turn south in economic and inflation momentum in the latter half of 2018 as well as the accumulation of event risks over the next several months among these trade tensions between the u s and china looms largest on that front prospects for a trade deal were dealt a blow this week with the announcement that president trump is unlikely to meet with chinese president xi before the march 2nd deadline for additional u s tariffs continued uncertainty about the tariff hike has led to volatility in the international trade data imports fell fairly substantially in november perhaps reversing some earlier inventory hoarding as hopes for a trade deal increased chart 1 they could rebound again in the months ahead as prospects dim as long as the economic tea leaves remain cloudy expect data dependent central bank officials to remain cautious taking the time to evaluate the cumulative impact of tighter financial conditions and slowing trade stateside this will have to be balanced against economic data that so far has continued to show resilience as expected initial jobless claims fell by 19k back towards post recession lows during the week ended feb 2nd as the effects of the longest u s government shutdown faded in conjunction with the jobs report released last week the data points to continued labor market strength still there are signs that the shutdown has had a negative impact on activity the pace of expansion in the services sector decelerated in january the ism non manufacturing index fell to 56 7 in january from 58 0 in december reflecting concerns about the government shutdown which negatively impacted new orders chart 2 in his state of the union address president trump pleaded for unity but continued to press a hardline on border security and immigration all eyes will be watching the february 15 deadline for a longer term funding package to avert yet another government shutdown that could take an additional toll on u s economic growth canada don t fret deleveraging yet canadian markets had a mixed week the tsx looked likely to end the week up a tick at the time of writing despite some volatility through thursday s trading session the modest gain came despite softer oil prices with both u s and canadian benchmarks trading a few dollars lower on the data front it was a quiet week with only two major indicators for economy watchers to digest first up was the household credit data for december 2018 unsurprisingly total credit continues to decelerate in the wake of past interest rate increases however what drew the most attention was an outright decline in consumer credit the first in five years chart 1 credit is the lifeblood of any modern economy so such a move bears closer scrutiny particularly as some have begun throwing out the term recession breaking out the r word is a bit premature for one thing shrinking consumer credit is a necessary condition for recession but not sufficient its hit rate as a predictor of a downturn is charitably about 33 meaning that this signal is wrong twice as often as it is correct what the data is saying however is that we are experiencing decelerating growth particularly for consumer spending this should come as no surprise canadians are digesting rising interest costs at the end of a multi decade borrowing cycle a moderation of credit is only a natural result to be sure the balance between repairing household finances and maintaining spending growth is a tricky one too sharp a deceleration of credit or an outright contraction deleveraging can have a marked negative impact on the economy just as too much credit growth drives financial risks higher the interplay of incomes and credit measures will be closely watched by the bank of canada in setting the path of borrowing costs going forward the result so far looks to be what we expect and we all should hope for a more modest pace of economic growth but one that comes with healthier consumer finances and a broadening of growth sources so while the credit data is throwing up a caution flag we aren t hitting the panic button just yet reinforcing the caution not panic narrative is a still solid labour market january saw an impressive 66 8k net jobs added as monthly private sector hiring set a new record chart 2 while not all details were as great total hours worked were actually down a bit and alberta experienced another challenging month the solid if modest hiring trend of 2018 appears to be continuing see our report on the trends that drove last year s performance so the takeaway from this week s data seems to be that yes the canadian economy is likely entering a period of more modest growth but this should not cause too much concern the process of repairing household balance sheets should be welcomed provided the pace remains within reason we have no reason to doubt that it will particularly given that canadian labour markets remain solid by almost any measure it is a long road ahead but so far so good u s upcoming key economic releases

you to everyone who s traveled here to lawrence i m deeply grateful that you came here on a cold and blustery day to be part of this i want to tell you a story a little over 100 years ago textile mills in lawrence like the ones behind us today employed tens of thousands of people and immigrants flocked here from more than 50 countries for a chance to work at the looms lawrence was one of the centers of american industry business was booming the guys at the top were doing great but workers made so little money that families were forced to crowd together in dangerous tenements and live on beans and scraps of bread inside the mills working conditions were horrible children were forced to operate dangerous equipment workers lost hands arms and legs in the gears of machines one out of every three adult mill workers died by the time they were 25 then on january 11 1912 a group of women who worked right here at the everett mill discovered that the bosses had cut their pay and that was it the women said enough is enough they shut down their looms and walked out soon workers walked out at another mill in town then another then another until 20 000 textile workers across lawrence were on strike these workers led by women didn t have much not even a common language nevertheless they persisted they organized they embraced common goals they translated the minutes of their meetings into 25 different languages so that the english and irish workers who had been here for years and the slavic and syrian workers new to america could stand together they hammered out their demands fair wages overtime pay and the right to join a union big business at the time called those demands a threat to the very survival of america and the bosses tried to shut it down they spread rumors and fear about the strikers one factory owner even paid a guy to plant sticks of dynamite around town so he could frame the workers as a violent mob the mill owners also owned city government which declared martial law and called in the militia some strikers died in violent clashes with the police it was a hard fight families that were already going to bed hungry had to make do with even less they were cold they were under attack but they stuck together and they won higher wages overtime everybody back at work and those workers did more than improve their own lives they changed america within weeks more than a quarter of a million textile workers throughout new england got raises within months massachusetts became the first state in the nation to pass a minimum wage law and today there are no children working in factories we have a national minimum wage and worker safety laws workers get paid overtime and we have a forty hour work week that s right because of workers here in lawrence and all across the country we have weekends the story of lawrence is a story about how real change happens in america it s a story about power our power when we fight together today millions and millions and millions of american families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well connected hard working people are up against a small group that holds far too much power not just in our economy but also in our democracy like the women of lawrence we are here to say enough is enough we are here to take on a fight that will shape our lives our children s lives and our grandchildren s lives just as surely as the fight that began in these streets more than a century ago because the man in the white house is not the cause of what s broken he s just the latest and most extreme symptom of what s gone wrong in america a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else and so once he s gone we can t pretend that all of this never happened it won t be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration we can t afford to just tinker around the edges a tax credit here a regulation there our fight is for big structural change this is the fight of our lives the fight to build an america where dreams are possible an america that works for everyone i am in that fight all the way and that is why i stand here today to declare that i am a candidate for president of the united states of america the truth is i ve been in this fight for a long time i grew up in oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class when my daddy had a heart attack my family nearly tumbled over the financial cliff but we didn t my mother who was 50 years old and had never worked outside the home walked to sears and got a minimum wage job answering phones that job saved our house and saved our family i ended up at a commuter college that cost 50 a semester and that is how the daughter of a janitor managed to become a public school teacher a law professor and a united states senator i believe in an america of opportunity i ve spent most of my life studying what happens to families like mine families caught in the squeeze families that go broke and what i found was that year after year the path to economic security had gotten tougher and rockier for working families and even tougher and even rockier for people of color i also found that this wasn t an accident it wasn t inevitable no over the years america s middle class had been deliberately hollowed out and families of color had been systematically discriminated against and denied their chance to build some security it started very quietly the richest and most powerful people in america were rich really rich but they wanted to be even richer regardless of who got hurt so every year bit by bit they lobbied washington and paid off politicians to tilt the system just a little more in their direction and year by year bit by bit more of the wealth and opportunity went to the people at the very top that s how today in the richest country in the history of the world tens of millions of people are struggling just to get by since the early 1970s adjusted for inflation wages in america have barely budged but the cost of housing has shot up nearly two thirds the cost of college has more than tripled and 40 of americans can t find 400 to cover an emergency that s millions of hard working people in this country whose lives would be turned upside down if the transmission fell out of the car or if somebody got sick and missed a week at work the middle class squeeze is real and millions of families can barely breathe it s not right this disaster has touched every community in america and for communities of color that have stared down structural racism for generations the disaster has hit even harder take home ownership the number one way middle class families build wealth in our country back in 1960 it was legal to discriminate against families of color and the gap between white homeownership rates and black homeownership rates was 27 percentage points that s a lot over time we finally changed the law to prohibit that kind of discrimination and the gap began to close but today the home ownership gap between black and white families is 30 percentage points bigger than it was back in 1960 when housing discrimination was actually legal race matters and we need to say so and we can t be blind to the fact that the rules in our country have been rigged against other people for a long time women lgbtq americans latinos native americans immigrants people with disabilities and we need to call it out but over the course of a generation the rules of our economy have gotten rigged so far in favor of the rich and powerful that everyone else is at risk of being left behind in 1940 90 of kids were destined to do better than their parents did by the 1980s the odds had slipped to 50 50 and now we could be the first generation in american history where more kids do worse than their parents meanwhile the rich and powerful seem to break the rules and pay no price no matter what they do they grow richer and more powerful bailouts for the bankers that cheat tax cuts for the companies that scam subsidies for the corporations that pollute that s what a rigged system looks like too little accountability for the rich and too little opportunity for everyone else when i talk about this some rich guys scream class warfare well let me tell you something these same rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard working people for decades i say it s time to fight back to protect their economic advantages the rich and powerful have rigged our political system as well they ve bought off or bullied politicians in both parties to make sure washington is always on their side some of them have even tried to buy their way into public office so today our government works just great for oil companies and defense contractors great for private prisons great for wall street banks and hedge funds it s just not working for anyone else when it comes to climate change our very existence is at stake but washington refuses to lift a finger without permission from the fossil fuel companies that s dangerous and it s wrong and it isn t just climate change look at any other major issue in america gun violence student loan debt the crushing cost of healthcare mistreatment of our veterans a broken criminal justice system an immigration system that lacks common sense and under this administration lacks a conscience overwhelming majorities of americans want action huge crowds march on washington demanding change letters phone calls protests but nothing happens nothing why because if you don t have money and you don t have connections washington doesn t want to hear from you when government works only for the wealthy and well connected that is corruption plain and simple it s time to fight back corruption is a cancer on our democracy and we will get rid of it only with strong medicine with real structural reform our fight is to change the rules so that our government our economy and our democracy work for everyone and i want to be crystal clear about exactly what i mean when i say that first we need to change the rules to clean up washington end the corruption we all know the trump administration is the most corrupt in living memory but even after trump is gone it won t be enough to do a better job of running a broken system we need to take power in washington away from the wealthy and well connected and put it back in the hands of the people where it belongs that s why i ve proposed the strongest and most comprehensive anti corruption law since watergate some examples shut down the revolving door between wall street and washington end lobbying as we know it and while we re at it ban foreign governments from hiring lobbyists in washington make justices of the united states supreme court follow a basic code of ethics ban members of congress from trading stocks how is that not already illegal and one more make every single candidate for federal office put their taxes online i ve done it everyone should do it that s one root out corruption in washington now two change the rules to put more economic power in the hands of the american people workers and small businesses middle class families and people of color who have been shut out of their chance to build wealth for generations again that requires real structural change right now giant corporations in america have too much power and they roll right over everyone else we need to put power back in the hands of workers make it quick and easy to join a union unions built america s middle class and unions will rebuild america s middle class make american companies accountable for their actions and raise wages by putting workers in those corporate boardrooms where the real decisions are made break up monopolies when they choke off competition take on wall street so that the big banks can never again threaten the security of our economy and when giant corporations and their leaders cheat their customers stomp out their competitors or rob their workers let s prosecute them and one more thing i m tired of hearing that we can t afford to make real investments in child care college and medicare for all can t afford things that help create economic opportunity for families i m tired of hearing that we can t afford to make investments in things like housing and opioid treatment can t afford things that address rural neglect or the legacy of racial discrimination i m tired of hearing what we can t afford because it is just not true we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world of course we can afford these investments but we need a government that makes different choices choices that reflect our values stop handing out enormous tax giveaways to rich people and giant corporations stop refusing to invest in our children stop stalling on spending money real money on infrastructure and clean energy and a green new deal and start asking the people who have gained the most from our country to pay their fair share that includes real tax reform in this country reforms that close loopholes and giveaways to the people at the top and an ultra millionaire tax to make sure rich people start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich so that s one clean up washington that s two change the rules in our economy now three change the rules to strengthen our democracy that starts with a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every american citizen to vote and to have that vote counted and that s just the beginning overturn every single voter suppression rule that racist politicians use to steal votes from people of color outlaw partisan gerrymandering by democrats and republicans and overturn citizens united our democracy is not for sale by the way if we truly believe that then we also need to end the unwritten rule of politics that says anyone who wants to run for office has to start by sucking up to rich donors on wall street and powerful insiders in washington i m opting out of that rule i m not taking a dime of pac money in this campaign i m not taking a single check from a federal lobbyist i m not taking applications from billionaires who want to run a super pac on my behalf and i challenge every other candidate who asks for your vote in this primary to say exactly the same thing it s not just our elections real democracy requires equal justice under law it s not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail while a bank executive who launders money for a drug cartel can get a bonus we need real reform it s not equal justice when for the exact same crimes african americans are more likely than whites to be arrested more likely to be charged more likely to be convicted and more likely to be sentenced yes we need criminal justice reform and we need it now and one more thing we must do to strengthen our democracy we must not allow those with power to weaponize hatred and bigotry to divide us more than 50 years ago dr martin luther king jr went to montgomery and warned us about the danger of division he talked about how bigotry and race baiting are used to keep black americans divided from white americans so that rich americans can keep picking all their pockets that playbook has been around forever whether it s white people against black people straight people against gay people middle class families against new immigrant families the story is the same the rich and powerful use fear to divide us we re done with that bigotry has no place in the oval office this is who we are we come from different backgrounds different religions different languages different experiences we have different dreams we are passionate about different issues and we feel the urgency of this moment in different ways but today we come together ready to raise our voices together until this fight is won our movement won t be divided by our differences it will be united by the values we share we all want a country where everyone not just the wealthy everyone can take care of their families we all want a country where every american not just the ones who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers everyone can participate in democracy where every child can dream big and reach for opportunity and we re all in the fight to build an america that works for everyone this won t be easy there are a lot of people out there with money and power and armies of lobbyists and lawyers people who are prepared to spend more money than you and i could ever dream of trying to stop us from making any of these solutions a reality people who will say it s extreme or radical to demand an america where every family has some economic security and every kid has a real opportunity to succeed i say to them get ready because change is coming faster than you think yeah this kind of fundamental change will be hard a lot of people even some of our friends will tell us it isn t even worth trying but we will not give up let me tell you one last story when i was home with my first baby i got this notion that i would go to law school it was a crazy idea but i persisted eventually i figured out the admissions tests and applications worked out how to pay my tuition and mapped out the 45 minute commute to campus weeks out i had one last thing on my checklist child care my daughter amelia was nearly two years old and i looked everywhere i struck out over and over we were down to the weekend before law school was supposed to start when i finally found a small place with a cheerful teacher nice little play area no funny smells in my price range but the place would only take children who were dependably potty trained i looked over at amelia she was happily pulling toys off the shelf her diaper barely covered by her pink stretchy pants dependably potty trained i now had five days to potty train an almost two year old all i can say is i stand before you today courtesy of three bags of m ms and a cooperative toddler since that day i ve never let anyone tell me that anything is too hard but oh how they ve tried people said it would be too hard to build an agency that would stop big banks from cheating americans on mortgages and credit cards but we got organized we fought back we persisted and now that consumer agency has forced these banks to refund nearly 12 billion directly to people they cheated when republicans tried to sabotage the agency i came back to massachusetts and then ran against one of them no woman had ever won a senate seat in massachusetts and people said it would be too hard for me to get elected but we got organized we fought back we persisted and now i am the senior senator from the commonwealth of massachusetts so no i am not afraid of a fight not even a hard fight when the women of everett mill walked away from their machines and out into the cold january air all those years ago they knew it wouldn t be easy but they also knew what was at stake for themselves and their families and they weren t going to let anyone tell them it was too hard doubters told the abolitionists it s too hard skeptics told the suffragettes it s too hard cynics told the trust busters it s too hard naysayers told the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement it s just too hard but they all kept right on going and they changed the history of america sure there will be plenty of doubters and cowards and armchair critics this time around but we learned a long time ago that you don t get what you don t fight for we are in this fight for our lives for our children for our planet for our futures and we will not turn back my daddy ended up as a janitor but his little girl got the chance to be a public school teacher a college professor a united states senator and a candidate for president of the united states i am grateful all the way to my bones grateful and determined so here is the promise i make to you today i will fight my heart out so that every kid in america can have the same opportunity i had a fighting chance to build something real i will never give up on you and your future i will never give up on your children and their future i am in this fight all the way it s a long way to election day but our fight starts here and it starts with you it starts with your decision to get involved right now join us on elizabethwarren com help us organize volunteer pitch in five bucks we need everyone in this fight the textile workers here in lawrence more than 100 years ago won their fight because they refused to be divided today we gather on those same streets ready to stand united again this is our moment in history the moment we are called to this is our moment to dream big fight hard and win

lawrence mass after more than month of exploring a presidential run u s sen elizabeth warren officially joined the 2020 democratic white house race saturday the massachusetts democrat laid out her campaign s vision of big structural change during a late morning kickoff event outside of the everett mill in lawrence read warren s 2020 announcement speech as prepared for delivery i want to tell you a story a little over 100 years ago textile mills in lawrence like the ones behind us today employed tens of thousands of people and immigrants flocked here from more than 50 countries for a chance to work at the looms lawrence was one of the centers of american industry business was booming the guys at the top were doing great but workers made so little money that families were forced to crowd together in dangerous tenements and live on beans and scraps of bread inside the mills working conditions were horrible children were forced to operate dangerous equipment workers lost hands arms and legs in the gears of machines one out of every three adult mill workers died by the time they were 25 then on january 11 1912 a group of women who worked right here at the everett mill discovered that the bosses had cut their pay and that was it the women said enough is enough they shut down their looms and walked out soon workers walked out at another mill in town then another then another until 20 000 textile workers across lawrence were on strike these workers led by women didn t have much not even a common language nevertheless they persisted they organized they embraced common goals they translated the minutes of their meetings into 25 different languages so that the english and irish workers who had been here for years and the slavic and syrian workers new to america could stand together they hammered out their demands fair wages overtime pay and the right to join a union big business at the time called those demands a threat to the very survival of america and the bosses tried to shut it down they spread rumors and fear about the strikers one factory owner even paid a guy to plant sticks of dynamite around town so he could frame the workers as a violent mob the mill owners also owned city government which declared martial law and called in the militia some strikers died in violent clashes with the police it was a hard fight families that were already going to bed hungry had to make do with even less they were cold they were under attack but they stuck together and they won higher wages overtime everybody back at work and those workers did more than improve their own lives they changed america within weeks more than a quarter of a million textile workers throughout new england got raises within months massachusetts became the first state in the nation to pass a minimum wage law and today there are no children working in factories we have a national minimum wage and worker safety laws workers get paid overtime and we have a forty hour work week that s right because of workers here in lawrence and all across the country we have weekends the story of lawrence is a story about how real change happens in america it s a story about power our power when we fight together today millions and millions and millions of american families are also struggling to survive in a system that has been rigged by the wealthy and the well connected hard working people are up against a small group that holds far too much power not just in our economy but also in our democracy like the women of lawrence we are here to say enough is

fundamental change will be hard a lot of people even some of our friends will tell us it isn t even worth trying but we will not give up let me tell you one last story when i was home with my first baby i got this notion that i would go to law school it was a crazy idea but i persisted eventually i figured out the admissions tests and applications worked out how to pay my tuition and mapped out the 45 minute commute to campus weeks out i had one last thing on my checklist child care my daughter amelia was nearly two years old and i looked everywhere i struck out over and over we were down to the weekend before law school was supposed to start when i finally found a small place with a cheerful teacher nice little play area no funny smells in my price range but the place would only take children who were hmm dependably potty trained i looked over at amelia she was happily pulling toys off the shelf her diaper barely covered by her pink stretchy pants hmmm dependably potty trained i now had five days to potty train an almost two year old all i can say is i stand before you today courtesy of three bags of m ms and a cooperative toddler since that day i ve never let anyone tell me that anything is too hard but oh how they ve tried people said it would be too hard to build an agency that would stop big banks from cheating americans on mortgages and credit cards but we got organized we fought back we persisted and now that consumer agency has forced these banks to refund nearly 12 billion directly to people they cheated when republicans tried to sabotage the agency i came back to massachusetts and then ran against one of them no woman had ever won a senate seat in massachusetts and people said it would be too hard for me to get elected but we got organized we fought back we persisted and now i am the seniorsenator from the commonwealth of massachusetts so no i am not afraid of a fight not even a hard fight when the women of everett mill walked away from their machines and out into the cold january air all those years ago they knew it wouldn t be easy but they also knew what was at stake for themselves and their families and they weren t going to let anyone tell them it was too hard doubters told the abolitionists it s too hard skeptics told the suffragettes it s too hard cynics told the trust busters it s too hard naysayers told the foot soldiers of the civil rights movement it s just too hard but they all kept right on going and they changed the history of america sure there will be plenty of doubters and cowards and armchair critics this time around but we learned a long time ago that you don t get what you don t fight for we are in this fight for our lives for our children for our planet for our futures and we will not turn back my daddy ended up as a janitor but his little girl got the chance to be a public school teacher a college professor a united states senator and a candidate for president of the united states i am grateful all the way to my bones grateful and determined so here is the promise i make to you today i will fight my heart out so that every kid in america can have the same opportunity i had a fighting chance to build something real i will never give up on you and your future i will never give up on your children and their future i am in this fight all the way it s a long way to election day but our fight starts here and it starts with you it starts with your decision to get involved right now join us on elizabeth warren com help us organize volunteer pitch in five bucks we need everyone in this fight the textile workers here in lawrence more than 100 years ago won their fight because they refused to be divided today we gather on those same streets ready to stand united again this is our moment in history the moment we are called to this is our moment to dream big fight hard and win

2019 earnings call during the quarter we delivered growing enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment and strong results in our professional education segment driven by the refreshed product differentiation in the becker business and continued growth in acams through our january 2019 term adtalem new student enrollment increased 4 9 while total student enrollment increased 2 9 from the prior year compared to the prior year period second quarter 2019 revenue increased nearly 3 and operating income increased approximately 17 aided largely by a onetime benefit from insurance proceeds related to hurricanes irma and maria excluding the onetime insurance benefit and other special items operating income decreased by about 5 in line with our expectations further we achieved several major milestones in the quarter including the successful completion of the devry university and carrington college transfers of ownership as well as the permanent relocation of the ross university school of medicine to barbados these initiatives required tremendous energy from the entire team and with their successful conclusion we are now focused on pursuing additional business development opportunities across our portfolio before i talk about our plans for the second half of fiscal 2019 let me give you a high level overview of our segment results during the quarter enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment were strong further we re seeing traction for our new facilities and newly developed partnerships in the vertical with regard to ross university school of medicine we opened the doors to its permanent home in barbados in january while it is still early we re already seeing encouraging trends and inquiries from prospective students now that rusm has a permanent home our new medical campuses sciences campus in barbados represents a state of the art academic institution including a society for simulation and healthcare ssh accredited simulation center additionally a cutting edge virtual anatomy lab and a best in class patient care center allows our faculty to better prepare medical students for the clinical experiences they pursue upon completion of their basic medical sciences training giving them an early competitive advantage relative to their peers as we discussed last quarter the new location for ross med has greatly improved airlift access from the united states canada and europe this will allow us to drive student enrollment growth toward and potentially above the previous peak enrollment that we achieved in 2014 ross vet continues to capitalize on the supply and demand imbalances in veterinary medicine as well as building awareness for its new research center which continues to attract clinicians and academicians from around the globe including dr robert gilbert professor emeritus at cornell university and a leading professor of animal reproductive biology and dr kerry ralph a leading european specialist in companion animal internal medicine and former faculty member at the university of edinburgh in november 2018 ross vet hosted the annual west indies veterinary conference the largest to date with nearly 500 attendees further enhancing ross vets reputation in the global veterinary profession meanwhile the american university of the caribbean school of medicine has established a partnership with the university of central lancashire in preston england providing a presence in the u k with its first cohort of medical school students expected to start in september of 2019 auc also launched the caribbean center for disaster medicine in partnership with harvard medical faculty physicians of beth israel deaconess medical center in march of this year the center will host its first caribbean disaster medicine international conference dr gregory ciottone international expert in disaster medicine from harvard medical school is headlining the event the lineup also includes experts from harvard t h chan school of public health john hopkins university of school of nursing and other global institutions and finally chamberlain university continues to see strong market demand for its campus based bsn program including at the ochsner collocated campus in louisiana and with the recent increases in enrollment caps at las vegas troy michigan and north brunswick new jersey all three are experiencing market demand well in excess of the previous enrollment caps this market demand is driven largely by more students enrolling directly into bsn programs rather than rns pursuing the bsn credential chamberlain also continued to experience solid market demand for its master and doctoral nursing programs nclex pass rates for chamberlain students continue to strengthen showing a significant upward trend from 2017 s annual rate of 84 with the third quarter calendar combined total pass rate of 91 4 12 of our 19 campuses that had nclex test takers exceeded the national nclex rate average in our professional education segment we had a strong quarter with revenue growth of approximately 39 including the improved performance of the becker business unit due to enhanced marketing effectiveness and refreshed product differentiation in addition to growth in accounting products and services including exam preparation where we re expanding our professional development content to support key changes in the accounting profession including the training of stem professionals in the industry for example becker is partnering with a large global accounting firm to codevelop an accounting and auditing for non accountants training course for the firm s stem professionals the content helps to speed on boarding of stem professionals to accounting and audit services engagements in acams we continue to see solid growth globally including in the u s europe and latin america our european efforts include expansion into poland and germany we have also gained some early traction in panama mexico and brazil our conferences continue to post record year over year growth with the las vegas conference attendees growing over 10 while we are encouraged by our results we continue to invest in the core business in order to position ourselves for further rapid expansion and finally in brazil while we continue to face currency headwinds and some top line revenue pressure we remain confident that the recent change in administration will settle the economy and provide ongoing stability the growth trends in distance learning since our soft launch in march 2018 are very positive and we re certain that this trend will continue based on our ability to deliver high quality academic programs and experience to our students our academic quality rankings by the brazilian ministry of education as reflected in our igc score a composite score focused on the national end of program exam enade faculty credentials and student satisfaction continues to consistently approve improve our average igc result was 282 this year the sixth year of improvement in that metric for adtalem brazil among the main national private institutions adtalem brazil institutions are ranked as the no 1 institution in eight of the 13 cities we serve based on the brazilian ministry of education s igc metric as we enter the second half of fiscal 2019 we remained poised for our continued organic growth in revenue and earnings driven by student enrollment increases the addition of new differentiated programs and products and enhanced technology enabled student learning environments we have accomplished a great deal over the course of the last several years and believe we are a stronger business for it today as we look ahead to the balance of fiscal 2019 we have strong cash flow brands that are associated with market leadership in each of our verticals products and services that are clearly differentiated in their respective markets and a team that understands both scale and profitability our team is more experienced diverse and growth oriented and that is reflected in our ability to deliver consistent operating results we will continue to focus and strategically align our portfolio to deliver growth while driving improved operating efficiencies across our organizations and prudently balancing our capital allocation by investing in platforms for growth while providing direct returns to our owners in the form of share repurchases our continued share repurchases reflect our ongoing confidence and excitement in our business as always we are committed to building a long term value for our fellow owners with that let me turn the call over to patrick for a deeper look at our financials for the quarter patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer thank you lisa and good afternoon everyone now turning to our results during the second quarter adtalem revenue of 317 million grew nearly 3 from the prior year growing enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment and the strength in our professional education segment driven by the improved performance of becker and growth in acams was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds in brazil on a constant currency basis adtalem revenue in the quarter increased 6 2 compared to the prior year operating costs excluding special items were 258 million in the second quarter compared to 247 million in the prior year a 4 6 increase was due primarily to investments including ross university school of medicine barbados transitionary costs and chamberlain new campus start up expenses as well as the impact of stranded costs we are tracking to our plan to reduce our home office expenses operating income from continuing operations excluding special items was 58 4 million compared to 61 3 million in the prior year net income from continuing operations excluding special items was 44 5 million compared to 50 3 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items was 0 74 compared to 0 81 in the prior year in line with our expectations fiscal 2019 second quarter results also reflect total pre tax special items including restructuring charges of 3 6 million primarily related to exiting the ross university school of medicine campus in dominica and real estate consolidations in adtalem s home office in addition we recorded a gain of 15 6 million from insurance proceeds related to hurricanes irma and maria turning to our second quarter segment results starting with medical and healthcare revenue of 213 million increased 4 6 compared to the prior year chamberlain revenue increased 6 2 in the quarter for the november session which is only a post licensure intake new student enrollment decreased 6 7 total student enrollment grew 3 7 compared to the prior year in january new student enrollment grew 6 4 and total students increased 3 3 new student enrollment growth included an impressive increase of 31 in our on campus bsn programs as well as growth across our master and doctoral level nursing programs revenue in the quarter for the medical and veterinary schools increased 2 4 to 90 million as compared to the prior year new student enrollment declined 8 5 and total student enrollment declined 6 6 in the january 2019 semester compared to the same semester last year the decline in new students is due to a shift in starts of students in the prior year from the september to january session due to hurricanes irma and maria excluding this impact new student enrollments increased 6 6 segment operating income excluding special items in the second quarter was 47 5 million compared to 55 million in the prior year the 14 decrease was due to cost increases to support future growth and return to a normal level of expense at the medical schools now turning to our professional education segment second quarter revenue increased 39 to 42 million compared to the prior year the significant improvement was due to a 16 increase in becker revenue due to enhanced marketing effectiveness while acams increased almost 65 due in part to the impact of the planned timing shift of the north american annual conference from fiscal q1 in the prior year to fiscal 2q in 2019 revenue associated with this conference totaled approximately 5 million during the quarter segment operating income was 9 6 million compared to 2 2 million in the prior year driven by revenue growth across both becker and acams second quarter technology and business segment revenue totaled 62 6 million a decrease of 16 6 and down 2 4 on a constant currency basis the decreases included lower tuition pricing necessary to offset the effect of student financial aid program reductions and increased competition however the segment is well positioned for new student enrollment growth in its online platforms segment operating income in the second quarter was 8 5 million compared to 14 million in the prior year second quarter operating income on a constant currency basis was 10 6 million the operating income reduction in the quarter was primarily driven by lower revenue the brazilian government recently changed regulations on opening and operating distance learning in the country the approval process for launching online facilities was streamlined making this segment more economically attractive to larger institutions adtalem brazil began offering several bachelors and associates degree programs via distance learning in february 2018 these programs are offered under the wyden online brand they are delivered through the damásio network of over 200 learning centers which is currently has the infrastructure and staff necessary to support distance learning degrees 2 085 new students enrolled in wyden online in the september 2018 session our effective tax rate from continuing operations excluding special items was 17 in the second quarter now turning to our balance sheet and financial position cash flow from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2019 totaled 23 million compared to 50 million in the prior year fiscal year to date capital expenditures totaled 35 million compared to 32 million in the prior year our net accounts receivable at december 31 2018 was 139 million an increase of 3 3 driven by the timing of financial aid receipts for the first six months of the fiscal year bad debt as a percentage of revenue was 1 1 compared to 1 3 in the prior year reflecting the quality of our programs and solid student outcomes we closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 295 million and outstanding bank borrowings of 299 million we are committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet to support our growth strategy and enhance shareholder returns during the first six months of fiscal year 2019 we repurchased approximately 2 4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 49 01 per share for a total of 115 9 million in january 2019 we completed our 10th share repurchase program we are now buying back shares under the 300 million program approved by our board last november 2018 we remain confident and committed to executing our long term strategic plan including share repurchasing as a part of our capital allocation strategy now turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter of 2019 we expect revenue to grow 1 to 2 compared to the prior year we expect third quarter 2019 operating costs before special items to increase 3 to 4 compared to the prior year the third quarter outlook assumes an exchange rate of brl 3 77 to the u s dollar consistent with our previous fiscal 2019 full year outlook we expect revenue to increase approximately 3 to 4 compared to the prior year and earnings per share from continuing operations before special items to grow in the 2 to 3 range compared to the prior year we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be in the 16 to 17 range the full year outlook assumes an exchange rate of brl 3 8 to the u s dollar full year capital spending is expected to be in the 65 million to 70 million range including approximately 20 million to 25 million for the relocation of rusm to barbados with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for q a questions and answers operator thank you and thank you our first question comes from the line of peter appert with piper jaffray please proceed peter appert piper jaffray analyst thanks good afternoon so maybe you could just expand a little bit on what you re seeing in brazil you highlighted increased competition and i guess the fies exposure is an issue seems like those issues might persist what would give you some confidence that you can improve the financial results there lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes hi peter so a couple of things certainly while we believe that the macro environment is stabilizing somewhat with a new administration etc we certainly understand that we don t have the controllables there as we look at our market we ve seen pricing pressure primarily on the wyden institution so separate from the ibmec online etc there s a couple of things there one is that pricing pressure a lot of it is coming from the fies our students there are using fies our fies percentage now is around 18 across all of our portfolio certainly below 20 which is less than half of what it was just a couple of years ago and then as we look at pricing we certainly become more competitive in the market at the wyden institution but we are focused on a couple of things making sure that we re differentiating those programs so that they are not as price sensitive we certainly have had some successes there in that trending the right way we are seeing growth in that segment as you look at the enrollment since it s fixed and then as we look wyden on site very early on in online very early on in that program what we re seeing that come through on the damásio channel and obviously that s going to do that and improve our operating margins because that s flowing through to the bottom line not as much as the of the on site variable cost so i think between that and some of the things that we re doing in the ibmec program and with that brand we re seeing really good growth there across some of the new programs partnerships etc we re pretty confident that we are going to be able to face those headwinds in brazil as it relates to currency etc no doubt there s a return so we re in a market in that type of emerging market but we are really well positioned from a brand perspective from a product differentiation perspective from a program perspective and across different elements of that market where we re pretty confident patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer we re peter seeing very nice continuation of a build in our new student enrollments in response to some of the pricing actions we ve taken so if you recall back in september new student enrollments in brazil were up about 24 it s a very successful continuation of our online launch even excluding that the base business new student enrollments were up almost 9 5 so as we come into the key enrollment cycle here in february and march and where we stand we re feeling increasingly confident on a nice continuation of those trends peter appert piper jaffray analyst got it ok thank you for that and then on the on nursing it really feels like the tale of two stories here right the rn the bsn quite weak the pre licensure quite strong anything you can do or anything structurally pricing wise marketing wise i m not sure what to perhaps stabilize the rn to bsn side of things lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes i mean we certainly if you look at rn to bsn in terms of the decline we re closing that gap and a lot of that has to do certainly with the marketing and some of the operational things we re trying to do to drive that as you look at part of it is the overall market and we discussed that before and we feel that certainly it s good to be positioned with the on site if you look at the a 31 growth there helps us understand that the market is shifting a bit while we see some of the pricing and some of the competitive trends there one of the things that we really are focusing on peter is thinking about how we can continue to work our hospital system and partnership systems there so that we continue to decrease those marketing costs and we re getting those students directly i mean ochsner as a collocation is a perfect example but certainly with a more aggressive look at that across the portfolio so yes certainly understand that but we feel like we ve got the right actions in place on both sides of those and very confident on the on site as the market continues to shift peter appert piper jaffray analyst and sticking with that for a sec lisa if you the ochsner relationship obviously has worked really well for you any thoughts in terms of new campus locations perhaps with other hospital partners lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes so obviously we wanted to prove out that model for one quarter doesn t a trend make we feel that we re at that point now where we are really stepping up across that across chamberlain university in general our partnership discussions we are not at a point now where we can identify here s the next one but certainly we ve identified this is a model that works for us works for the hospital partners so as we start to think more about solving the pain points for a hospital system across there to work for us model this partnership with ochsner really helps us understand how to do that better and we re able to really do what are the cost that we re able to save and streamline because of that so we are actively looking as you may recall we have a new campus a next one in terms of a stand alone or a chamberlain university campus is scheduled for san antonio texas that is on track and so we will open that but absolutely stocked of being able to do something in parallel should we get the right partner and we ve got a few in the funnel patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer is it peter just to add with that we ve seen very nice increases in our enrollment caps based on the continuation of very solid nclex results so we ve seen caps increased in michigan las vegas north brunswick new jersey so as that market continues to shift as lisa said we re really well positioned with our campus footprint but increasingly so our ability to increase the campus size is to meet that market demand peter appert piper jaffray analyst right understood and last thing and i ll let someone else get on pat the guide would suggest very strong fiscal fourth quarter numbers i think if i m doing my math correctly can you just highlight some of the things that are really causing the inflection in the results later in the year patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer yes that s very much consistent with our point of view increasingly as we exit fiscal 2019 and then start to see an acceleration of both revenue and earnings in fiscal 2020 we ll start to all share that and see that in the fourth quarter driven by the continuation of the very nice build in total student enrollments at chamberlain increasingly as we see total student enrollments build at brazil and then with the increased contribution and the nice stability that we re seeing with becker in prof ed those all coming together quite nicely and then of course the inherent leverage in the business is that flows through the bottom line to see both revenue and earnings grow peter appert piper jaffray analyst great thank you guys lisa wardell president and chief executive officer thanks peter operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff silber with bmo capital markets please proceed jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you so much wanted to focus on margins for the medical and healthcare business they were down somewhat year over year and i know there was some noise in terms of a timing shift and maybe some relocation costs will we expect margins on a year over year basis in that segment to be up year over year in the second half patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer on a full year basis we d expect margins to be somewhat comparable to slightly lower just slightly lower than prior year full year fy 18 just as a result of a little bit of that noise you referenced in some higher absorption of home office cost but as we move into 2020 then we ll start to see the margins expand with the benefit of the growing enrollments jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok great that s helpful and just focusing on the i think you said there was a 31 year over year increase in enrollments on campus in your bsn program i knew you had a number of caps lifted if i remember correctly there were also some new schools that were open do you have that on a same school basis excluding the caps i m just trying to normalize what the growth was patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer really as you look about it with the way we think about it this is on a same school basis with the exception of ochsner which would ve contributed about 30 new student enrollments jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok wow that s a pretty good number and then you had mentioned in your prepared remarks i think you called it additional business development activities across the portfolio if we can just get a little bit more color on what you re referring to lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes sure so really as we look at his back half of 19 this is really the first time that we ve been able to clear out a lot of the noise as you can imagine a lot of our resources and focus across the certainly across home office and the entire portfolio has been very focused on both divestitures as well as the relocation and so as we go into back half of the year we have been having a lot more conversations across the portfolio as it relates to how we can better serve our employers but we have employer relationships obviously the hospital systems but multinational finance institutions on the acams and becker side we re starting to see traction in terms of partnerships and potential partnerships to cross sell within professional education between becker and acams we had mentioned it before but really was more of a paper exercise versus getting those partnerships in place on the medical side as an example auc now having a campus where we won t actually have students in september on the uclan campus in the u k small class to start but certainly a growth potential there as we build that incremental students and revenue for us on the ross med side articulation agreements where we announced charles drew we have several others that will be announced in the next month or so or actually this month that will allow us to both drive students lower marketing costs that type of things so we re really getting out as we now have this group president model that we think about at the last person to fill that team out for me i mentioned before was kathy boden holland on the medical healthcare group just last may june timeframe so now with the relo of ross complete and having a permanent home there we are geared up to do what we do quite well when we have the time and capacity and that is to develop relationships that drive new student enrollment across the portfolio jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok great thank you so much lisa wardell president and chief executive officer welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex paris of barrington research please proceed chris howe barrington research analyst good afternoon this is chris howe sitting in for alex my first question is you touched on it many times and provided some great color on this just in regard to acams and becker you mentioned the longer term guidance for acams prior to this call how should we look at these two businesses on a longer term basis beyond this fiscal year where would you say it is as far as its runway for growth and its contribution to longer term guidance patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer no great question chris and we are very much in line in tracking with the longer term guidance that we ve provided back in may at investor day that we would see very nice continuation of double digit revenue growth and then see a very nice flow through and margins continuing to expand over time but as we continue to reinvest in the business so very much on track with what we had shared in our five year plan and very pleased to see some very nice stabilization of becker and a continuation of those trends chris howe barrington research analyst that s great thank you pat and this leads me to my follow up question lisa touched on it a little bit about the different cross selling opportunities between becker and acams where would you say you are as far as the awareness of these opportunities and the realization of monetizing the cross selling opportunities here lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes sure i would say the good news is that it s early stage in terms of the easy for me to say making revenue from that but in terms of awareness it s very high right because we now have a as i mentioned to group president that is able to shift in and among the institutions as well as obviously the folks who run those institutions and sort of putting in some new talent six to nine months ago or almost a year now for acams is really starting to pay dividends as we see these connections so i think accounting for stem is just early stage we re seeing lots of different things that we re able to do as we think about not only the acams model but what are the other places in terms of certifications etc that we d be able to use that model because we are recognized in the market as it relates to certifications etc so more to come there but certainly feel like we have a long runway for that in terms of revenue but probably five or six out of 10 in terms of our awareness as we talk to our employers customers etc chris howe barrington research analyst very helpful that s all the questions i have right now operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff mueler with baird please proceed jeff meuler baird analyst yes thank you maybe to start just i guess glass half empty take on the guidance question the q3 guidance could you just given that really strong implied q4 is there anything in q3 that we should be considering from a timing or comp perspective or something along those lines just given that there s i guess slower growth in q3 and i know q2 benefited from the timing of the acams conference but just any other comments or considerations for q3 guidance patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer yes jeff we will have and once we re out of q3 of next year have overlapped some of the noise from the hurricanes so if you go back and look we ve been very transparent in our prior disclosures on the quantification there but of course there was a shift of revenue as we needed to delay classes for a couple of weeks so revenue that we would ve normally taught in would have recognized in the second quarter had shifted into the third quarter the prior year so we ll be overcoming a little bit of that and then of course just the seasonality of the third quarter is one of our weaker in earnings because brazil isn t teaching but just a month and a half in that quarter and then that s we ll obviously see the nice acceleration and again as we sit here today very much unchanged from our full year guidance in terms of both revenue and eps lisa wardell president and chief executive officer right so i was just going to add you know me jeff to make it the glass half full i would say we ve got significant upside and confidence in our q4 particularly as some of these other corporate development initiatives are driving through the portfolio so very confident in our full year guidance and again as patrick said been very transparent about what s shifted as it relates to q3 jeff meuler baird analyst got it and then on the nursing enrollment cap increases i guess to what extent is that a direct link to the improved nclex passage rates and can increased caps kind of become a regular thing that we see year in and year out lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes so it is a direct correlation each state as you know this is part of our competitive differentiation because each state s board of nursing makes these distinctions particularly when you start talking about when you become uncapped as in new brunswick and then it s all about your capacity to take new students and so we absolutely anticipate that that will continue when you think about our this our three newest campuses all testing at 100 pass rate for the nclex students that came through sacramento etc the newer campuses we would anticipate that those caps would get lifted obviously a lot earlier depending upon our ability to continue to show post those kind of nclex scores so while the academic quality piece is the most important to us just because our mission is education it really does tie very nicely to how we think about financial metrics and revenue growth jeff meuler baird analyst ok and then becker a really impressive turnaround there i guess i m just trying to vet the sustainability or how we could think about or how you think about underlying growth potential of that business following the changes to product to marketing patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer yes so very much see this is being very sustainable as we ve pivoted specifically in sharpening our value prop and our competitive pricing in the b2c side of the business that represents about 30 of becker s overall revenue so we have seen a very strong market response to the improved product and some of the pricing changes and we re starting to see a continuation of that into the current quarter and again as we ve stacked three four quarters in a roll here we re increasingly confident in terms of the stabilization of that business and then i think as we think about becker more strategically the continued growth of the continued professional education so look we help 40 000 students a year prepare and start their careers as cpa and now we want to leverage that reputation the impact that we ve had in keeping them in the career with continuing professional education and we ve had some very nice wins lately with some large accounting firms and helping them solve some workforce problems so we re really starting to see a nice continuation and growing becker beyond just being known for the cpa test prep jeff meuler baird analyst ok and then last one for me lisa could you just help me better understand steven s role with the promotion i guess from my perspective usually i see coos have you there p l or some sort of business unit responsibility so the description reads a little different and then i think he also leads ir but he doesn t have a formal role on conference calls so just if you could just maybe talk about that promotion and his role thanks lisa wardell president and chief executive officer sure absolutely so it actually ties directly to some of the things that i ve been talking about here but obviously in general terms because we wanted to make sure that we re ticked and tied and announce and that s really on the strategic strategy and corporate development side and so if you think about what i have done in the past and actually what steve did in his past role it s really around corporate development business development relationships certainly m a we have both organic and inorganic as we think about across the longer strategic time horizon and so his role in terms of adding the chief operating officer is really to enable us to have that capacity and have someone who can drive these things from start to finish as we work with the group presidents and think about how we can better position ourselves as it relates to being responsive to employers beyond the institutions themselves obviously that is important as we educate but beyond that as we think about how do we have life long learners and how do we drive through the workforce or employer sort of life cycle and student life cycle that s something that he can really be helpful with as we think about his past experience and then how he interacts in and among the institutions and the units here jeff meuler baird analyst ok thank you lisa wardell president and chief executive officer well we would like to thank everybody for joining the adtalem global education q2 conference call we really appreciate your support and we look forward to talking to you next quarter patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer ok thank you everybody operator duration 44 minutes call participants chaka patterson vice president

u s review catching up on what was missing from q4 the ism non manufacturing index fell 1 3 points in january to a still relatively robust 56 7 the u s trade deficit narrowed by a surprising 6 4 billion in november as imports slowed abruptly weekly data on jobless claims and mortgage application came in weaker than expected while the weekly railroad data began the year on a strong note the high frequency data will take on increasing significance in coming weeks as delays in reporting some economic data have made it more difficult to assess the economy s current underlying momentum piecing together an outlook with limited data the flow of delayed economic reports picked up this week with reports on factory orders and international trade providing a clearer picture of what q4 real gdp growth was the weakness in factory orders continued along its recent trend with overall orders falling 0 6 in november and orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft falling by that same amount factory orders have been trending lower as uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations caused firms to become more cautious many firms also built precautionary inventories of key components ahead of the implementation of tariffs last year those stocks have been gradually depleted and firms do not appear to be taking similar precautious ahead of a jump in tariffs that potentially could take place on march 1 if that is the case businesses are less prepared for a ratcheting up of tariffs and such a move might prove much more disruptive if it were to occur data on international trade for november were largely consistent with this thesis the nation s trade deficit narrowed by 6 4 billion to 49 3 billion imports fell 2 9 while exports fell 0 6 the drop in imports likely reflects the drawdown in inventories of imported raw materials and components that were built up ahead of the implementation of tariffs last year we will likely see a rebound over the next two months as shipments from china were likely pulled into december and january ahead of the lunar new year even with a rebound in december imports the trade deficit is likely to either produce less of drag on gdp growth during the fourth quarter or may actually add to growth q4 real gdp might grow as much as 3 well ahead of our most recent forecast the swing in trade is hard to judge however as there is also likely to be a corresponding drop in inventories we suspect imports will rebound which could produce a large drag for q1 2019 gauging the economy s underlying momentum is difficult because of some of the delays and impacts of the government shutdown last friday s surprising strength in nonfarm payrolls for example might have been bolstered by furloughed government workers taking part time jobs the shutdown might also be disrupting the recent trend in weekly jobless claims which have picked up recently some of the best data we have today may be the monthly ism reports for manufacturing and non manufacturing both have fallen back from their earlier highs but also remain at levels consistent with strong economic growth the latest ism non manufacturing index fell 1 3 points to 56 7 while that marked a larger than expected drop the december data were revised higher business activity fell 1 5 points to 59 7 which marked the second consecutive decline new orders fell five points to 57 7 the drop in the ism while slightly larger than expected leaves the index in pretty solid shape the composite index is 2 4 points below its average for the past six months of 59 1 which seems about right the economy likely grew at better than a 3 pace during the second half of last year and will likely grow at a slower pace during the first quarter the high frequency data may take on growing importance in coming weeks as we try to get a better assessment of what is happening in homebuilding in particular the weekly mortgage applications data had perked up when mortgage rates fell but have been struggling more recently mortgage applications for the purchase of a new home tumbled 4 9 in the most recent week marking the third consecutive decline u s outlook nfib survey tuesday like many other measures of confidence the nfib s index of small business optimism has seen some retracement in recent months as recently as august this proxy for small business confidence was in record high territory since that time the tariffs on 200 billion of goods targeted against china went into effect the stock market entered a period of pronounced volatility that had been missing for a few years and of course the u s government had a record long shutdown with all of those variables to contend with it is not terribly surprising that many measures of consumer and business confidence have come off the boil we recently learned that the ism index a manufacturers survey bounced back in january on tuesday of next week we will get a read on small business optimism previous 104 4 consensus 103 0 cpi wednesday the fed is charged with promoting full employment while achieving low and stable inflation while the pce deflator can boast that it is the fed s preferred measure of inflation the cpi report is closely watched by financial markets for other clues about prices in december there was evidence that a number of factors have been driving inflation higher that was easy to miss because the headline measure was pulled down by falling energy costs and lower commodity prices ex energy cpi rose 0 2 month over month in december and is up 2 1 over the past year on wednesday of next week financial markets will get a look at cpi numbers for january for a patient and data dependent fed these inflation numbers are key previous 0 1 wells fargo 0 1 consensus 0 1 month over month retail sales friday among the many frustrations of the partial u s government shutdown has been the delay of key economic releases near the top of the list in terms of importance is the retail sales report thursday of next week offers the first look at how the year finished for the nation s stores and online vendors this is a particularly important month as it includes most of the key holiday shopping outlays that can make or break a store s year in terms of profitability measures of consumer confidence have slipped in recent months though some measures of same store sales showed momentum in the final month of the year we are looking for a 0 3 increase in december retail sales previous 0 2 wells fargo 0 3 consensus 0 1 month over month global review global central banks remain in focus the reserve bank of australia met this week and while no changes to interest rates were made the central bank signaled a shift away from a hawkish stance to a more neutral bias european economic data continue to disappoint as well with german factory orders missing expectations as economic data continue to soften the ecb may also begin a shift to a more dovish stance on monetary policy as well with a new administration seeking to implement its reform agenda the central bank of brazil decided to hold policy rates at this week s meeting central bank officials also suggested rates will remain on hold until progress on reforms is made most global central banks stuck in neutral the reserve bank of australia rba held its first meeting of 2019 this week to determine the path of monetary policy while no changes in interest rates were made the rba did however make a notable adjustment to its outlook for future monetary policy decisions in its statement following the meeting the rba officially changed to a neutral policy stance dialed back from a previously modestly hawkish bias leaving the door open to potential interest rate cuts as well as hikes with growth rates slowing largely due to weaker demand from china and a softening housing market which could create a further drag on the economy we believe the rba is likely to be on hold for the foreseeable future with the balance of risks now shifting toward rate cuts markets have responded to the combination of china s economic deceleration and domestic factors as well as expectations have reversed from anticipated rate hikes in 2018 to the rba cutting interest rates in 2019 the theme of a decelerating european economy continues to gather momentum as economic data out of germany this week were weaker than consensus estimates and reveal a further slowdown in broader eurozone economic activity december german factory orders contracted 7 year over year down from a 4 3 contraction one month prior while industrial production remains in contraction territory as well germany in particular has been a source of concern within the european economy as the country narrowly avoided a technical recession in late 2018 while cpi inflation declined more than expected while we do not believe a eurozone recession is imminent risks to this outlook have shifted to the downside with the eurozone economy broadly slowing down this also raises some caution regarding the ecb s path toward removing accommodative monetary policy indeed we forecast gradual moves by the european central bank ecb with the initial rate hikes anticipated to occur in q4 2019 and q2 2020 in the interim the ecb will remain on hold and continue to evaluate economic data in determining the future path of monetary policy outside of the g10 the central bank of brazil met this week to decide policy rates and provide markets with forward guidance on the path of monetary policy after crisis conditions emerged in 2014 2015 the central bank raised policy rates significantly in an effort to control inflation and defend the real as conditions stabilized the central bank embarked on the process of lowering policy rates bringing interest rates down to 6 50 from a peak of 14 25 over the course of a few years as a new reform minded administration settles into office and with a new governor taking over the central bank the central bank of brazil has opted to keep policy rates on hold statements from key officials suggest rates will be on hold for the foreseeable future as they wait for economic reforms to be proposed and implemented in particular addressing the country s need for pension reform we believe policy rates will be steady through 2019 as well as inflationary pressures have receded and as the currency stabilizes global outlook u k gdp monday despite uncertainties related to brexit real gdp growth in the u k has been resilient gdp grew at 1 5 year over year in q3 while economic activity and sentiment indicators remained in expansion throughout the fourth quarter q4 gdp could be significant as it is one of the final readings before the current march 29 brexit deadline a deal or no brexit scenario would likely result in higher growth rates while a no deal scenario could potentially cause large disruptions to the u k economy commentary from the bank of england boe after this week s monetary policy committee meeting suggests the effects of brexit on economic growth may be more severe going forward than initially anticipated with the boe cutting its growth forecasts for 2019 down to 1 2 from 1 7 with a wide range of potential outcomes available we maintain our base case scenario that a no deal brexit will be avoided previous 1 5 wells fargo 1 4 consensus 1 4 year over year india cpi tuesday cpi inflation in india has been trending lower since early 2018 and with oil prices still relatively subdued inflation is likely to remain toward the lower end of the central bank s target range global oil prices have recovered marginally to start the year and with oil representing a large part of india s cpi basket a slight uptick in january inflation would not be all that surprising in an effort to spark further inflation and provide an added boost to the economy the reserve bank of india opted to cut policy rates at this week s monetary policy meeting taking markets and analysts by surprise ahead of the meeting key advisors to prime minister narendra modi suggested the central bank cut rates and pursue expansionary monetary policy to match the government s more expansionary budget looser monetary policy will help put cpi inflation on a more stable and potentially upward trajectory heading into 2019 previous 2 2 japan gdp wednesday economic growth in japan has underwhelmed for the majority of 2018 with q3 gdp contracting by 2 5 quarter over quarter annualized natural disasters had a large influence over japan s output during q3 however early indicators suggest a slight rebound in growth may occur in q4 measures of economic activity such as retail sales and industrial production have shown some improvement while business confidence surveys suggest a potential uptick in activity as well a modest recovery of growth in q4 has been factored into our forecast for full year 2018 growth and despite a small acceleration we still anticipate relatively subdued growth of 0 7 looking ahead into 2019 we forecast growth in japan to remain modest although it has been suggested by government officials that additional stimulus measures may be implemented in an effort to achieve more favorable growth and inflation dynamics as of now we currently forecast japan to grow around 0 8 in 2019 previous 2 5 wells fargo 1 4 consensus 1 4 quarter over quarter point of view interest rate watch and then there was one earlier this week we released our updated views on the economy with our february monthly outlook one key change to our forecast is that we have pushed back the timing of further fed policy tightening we now expect the fomc to next raise the fed funds rate in q3 whereas previously we had penciled in a hike in q2 the delay stems in part from the more dovish tone from fed officials the past couple of weeks in its january statement the fomc removed forward guidance for further increases and vowed to be patient in his post meeting press conference chairman powell chalked up the reason for such an about face in policy guidance since december to cross currents in the economy weighing on the outlook has been slower growth abroad particularly in china which has been a headwind to exports activity in the housing market has also cooled amid higher mortgage rates for much of last year beyond the housing market s struggle with higher mortgage rates financial conditions tightened significantly at the end of last year visibility on growth has also been reduced by the partial government shutdown market participants currently believe the fomc is done raising rates this cycle as a result but that call looks premature in our view consumer spending remains solid which has helped strong job growth and rising wages at the same time fiscal policy remains simulative and growth remains above the fomc s estimates of potential financial conditions have also eased over the past month while we believe the fomc is not quite done tightening policy yet we believe the q3 hike will be the lone increase this year previously we looked for hikes in q2 2019 and q4 2019 by that time the fed funds rate would be within the committee s estimated range of neutral also with the economy expected to be showing more meaningful signs of deceleration late in the year we expect the fed will need to stand pat at that point before eventually reversing course in late 2020 and cutting rates for more details please see crosscurrents and the outlook for fed policy credit market insights 2019 bank lending outlook credit is the lifeblood of the economy as reliable and affordable financing is a key ingredient for sustained economic growth the january senior loan officer survey asked banks about their expectations for lending over the course of 2019 on balance the reported tightening of lending standards weaker demand and deteriorating performance are consistent with our expectation of moderating economic growth 2 5 and 2 2 real gdp growth in 2019 and 2020 respectively the consumer powered much of the abovetrend growth we estimate it at 2 9 of this past year and we expect consumption to again drive growth this year as business fixed investment and the housing market slow recognizing this banks expect demand to fall across business and household lending categories with demand for credit card debt being the lone exception with corporate debt at an all time high and the economic expansion near record length banks expect to tighten lending standards across sectors lenders anticipate chargeoffs and delinquencies will modestly increase during 2019 listing their top reasons for tightening standards banks named lower risk tolerance and deterioration in the value of collateral and in the quality of their portfolios aside from the survey evidence hard data suggest lending remains healthy in the week ending january 23 total bank credit was up 5 year over year with particular strength in commercial industrial loans for now credit continues to flow topic of the week creative destruction still present today today marks what would have been the 136th birthday of joseph schumpeter one of the most famous economists of the 20th century schumpeter s contribution to the field was varied and cut across a broad swath of topics but perhaps the most well known aspect of his career was the popularization of the concept of creative destruction in their models economists often think in terms of equilibria economic growth converges toward potential the unemployment rate reaches its natural rate and prices adjust smoothly along the path toward this peaceful equilibrium while these approaches have obvious merit and are useful tools in economic analysis schumpeter drew attention to the industrial mutation which incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one put another way the actual process by which economies grow over time is far bumpier the past decade or so is an excellent example of this since 2007 the u s economy has experienced a housing bust shifting demographics significant swings in monetary and fiscal policy and vastly different political regimes at home and abroad some new industries have exploded e sports while others have faced challenges traditional taxi cabs in an age of ridesharing apps or the secular decline in manufacturing employment top chart through it all real gdp per capita in the united states is about 10 higher today than it was in 2007 bottom chart with the current expansion approaching record duration the u s economy has neared its equilibrium level the output gap has steadily closed core inflation is relatively steady near 2 and the fed funds rate is at the lower end of the federal reserve s estimates of neutral perhaps the expansion will continue for years to come with growth inflation and interest rates humming along smoothly at their equilibrium levels more likely though the process will be marked by turbulence large swings in both directions and of course creative destruction

officer good afternoon and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call during the quarter we delivered growing enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment and strong results in our professional education segment driven by the refreshed product differentiation in the becker business and continued growth in acams through our january 2019 term adtalem new student enrollment increased 4 9 while total student enrollment increased 2 9 from the prior year compared to the prior year period second quarter 2019 revenue increased nearly 3 and operating income increased approximately 17 aided largely by a onetime benefit from insurance proceeds related to hurricanes irma and maria excluding the onetime insurance benefit and other special items operating income decreased by about 5 in line with our expectations further we achieved several major milestones in the quarter including the successful completion of the devry university and carrington college transfers of ownership as well as the permanent relocation of the ross university school of medicine to barbados these initiatives required tremendous energy from the entire team and with their successful conclusion we are now focused on pursuing additional business development opportunities across our portfolio before i talk about our plans for the second half of fiscal 2019 let me give you a high level overview of our segment results during the quarter enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment were strong further we re seeing traction for our new facilities and newly developed partnerships in the vertical with regard to ross university school of medicine we opened the doors to its permanent home in barbados in january while it is still early we re already seeing encouraging trends and inquiries from prospective students now that rusm has a permanent home our new medical campuses sciences campus in barbados represents a state of the art academic institution including a society for simulation and healthcare ssh accredited simulation center additionally a cutting edge virtual anatomy lab and a best in class patient care center allows our faculty to better prepare medical students for the clinical experiences they pursue upon completion of their basic medical sciences training giving them an early competitive advantage relative to their peers as we discussed last quarter the new location for ross med has greatly improved airlift access from the united states canada and europe this will allow us to drive student enrollment growth toward and potentially above the previous peak enrollment that we achieved in 2014 ross vet continues to capitalize on the supply and demand imbalances in veterinary medicine as well as building awareness for its new research center which continues to attract clinicians and academicians from around the globe including dr robert gilbert professor emeritus at cornell university and a leading professor of animal reproductive biology and dr kerry ralph a leading european specialist in companion animal internal medicine and former faculty member at the university of edinburgh in november 2018 ross vet hosted the annual west indies veterinary conference the largest to date with nearly 500 attendees further enhancing ross vets reputation in the global veterinary profession meanwhile the american university of the caribbean school of medicine has established a partnership with the university of central lancashire in preston england providing a presence in the u k with its first cohort of medical school students expected to start in september of 2019 auc also launched the caribbean center for disaster medicine in partnership with harvard medical faculty physicians of beth israel deaconess medical center in march of this year the center will host its first caribbean disaster medicine international conference dr gregory ciottone international expert in disaster medicine from harvard medical school is headlining the event the lineup also includes experts from harvard t h chan school of public health john hopkins university of school of nursing and other global institutions and finally chamberlain university continues to see strong market demand for its campus based bsn program including at the ochsner collocated campus in louisiana and with the recent increases in enrollment caps at las vegas troy michigan and north brunswick new jersey all three are experiencing market demand well in excess of the previous enrollment caps this market demand is driven largely by more students enrolling directly into bsn programs rather than rns pursuing the bsn credential chamberlain also continued to experience solid market demand for its master and doctoral nursing programs nclex pass rates for chamberlain students continue to strengthen showing a significant upward trend from 2017 s annual rate of 84 with the third quarter calendar combined total pass rate of 91 4 12 of our 19 campuses that had nclex test takers exceeded the national nclex rate average in our professional education segment we had a strong quarter with revenue growth of approximately 39 including the improved performance of the becker business unit due to enhanced marketing effectiveness and refreshed product differentiation in addition to growth in accounting products and services including exam preparation where we re expanding our professional development content to support key changes in the accounting profession including the training of stem professionals in the industry for example becker is partnering with a large global accounting firm to codevelop an accounting and auditing for non accountants training course for the firm s stem professionals the content helps to speed on boarding of stem professionals to accounting and audit services engagements in acams we continue to see solid growth globally including in the u s europe and latin america our european efforts include expansion into poland and germany we have also gained some early traction in panama mexico and brazil our conferences continue to post record year over year growth with the las vegas conference attendees growing over 10 while we are encouraged by our results we continue to invest in the core business in order to position ourselves for further rapid expansion and finally in brazil while we continue to face currency headwinds and some top line revenue pressure we remain confident that the recent change in administration will settle the economy and provide ongoing stability the growth trends in distance learning since our soft launch in march 2018 are very positive and we re certain that this trend will continue based on our ability to deliver high quality academic programs and experience to our students our academic quality rankings by the brazilian ministry of education as reflected in our igc score a composite score focused on the national end of program exam enade faculty credentials and student satisfaction continues to consistently approve improve our average igc result was 282 this year the sixth year of improvement in that metric for adtalem brazil among the main national private institutions adtalem brazil institutions are ranked as the no 1 institution in eight of the 13 cities we serve based on the brazilian ministry of education s igc metric as we enter the second half of fiscal 2019 we remained poised for our continued organic growth in revenue and earnings driven by student enrollment increases the addition of new differentiated programs and products and enhanced technology enabled student learning environments we have accomplished a great deal over the course of the last several years and believe we are a stronger business for it today as we look ahead to the balance of fiscal 2019 we have strong cash flow brands that are associated with market leadership in each of our verticals products and services that are clearly differentiated in their respective markets and a team that understands both scale and profitability our team is more experienced diverse and growth oriented and that is reflected in our ability to deliver consistent operating results we will continue to focus and strategically align our portfolio to deliver growth while driving improved operating efficiencies across our organizations and prudently balancing our capital allocation by investing in platforms for growth while providing direct returns to our owners in the form of share repurchases our continued share repurchases reflect our ongoing confidence and excitement in our business as always we are committed to building a long term value for our fellow owners with that let me turn the call over to patrick for a deeper look at our financials for the quarter patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer thank you lisa and good afternoon everyone now turning to our results during the second quarter adtalem revenue of 317 million grew nearly 3 from the prior year growing enrollments in our medical and healthcare segment and the strength in our professional education segment driven by the improved performance of becker and growth in acams was somewhat offset by foreign currency headwinds in brazil on a constant currency basis adtalem revenue in the quarter increased 6 2 compared to the prior year operating costs excluding special items were 258 million in the second quarter compared to 247 million in the prior year a 4 6 increase was due primarily to investments including ross university school of medicine barbados transitionary costs and chamberlain new campus start up expenses as well as the impact of stranded costs we are tracking to our plan to reduce our home office expenses operating income from continuing operations excluding special items was 58 4 million compared to 61 3 million in the prior year net income from continuing operations excluding special items was 44 5 million compared to 50 3 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding special items was 0 74 compared to 0 81 in the prior year in line with our expectations fiscal 2019 second quarter results also reflect total pre tax special items including restructuring charges of 3 6 million primarily related to exiting the ross university school of medicine campus in dominica and real estate consolidations in adtalem s home office in addition we recorded a gain of 15 6 million from insurance proceeds related to hurricanes irma and maria turning to our second quarter segment results starting with medical and healthcare revenue of 213 million increased 4 6 compared to the prior year chamberlain revenue increased 6 2 in the quarter for the november session which is only a post licensure intake new student enrollment decreased 6 7 total student enrollment grew 3 7 compared to the prior year in january new student enrollment grew 6 4 and total students increased 3 3 new student enrollment growth included an impressive increase of 31 in our on campus bsn programs as well as growth across our master and doctoral level nursing programs revenue in the quarter for the medical and veterinary schools increased 2 4 to 90 million as compared to the prior year new student enrollment declined 8 5 and total student enrollment declined 6 6 in the january 2019 semester compared to the same semester last year the decline in new students is due to a shift in starts of students in the prior year from the september to january session due to hurricanes irma and maria excluding this impact new student enrollments increased 6 6 segment operating income excluding special items in the second quarter was 47 5 million compared to 55 million in the prior year the 14 decrease was due to cost increases to support future growth and return to a normal level of expense at the medical schools now turning to our professional education segment second quarter revenue increased 39 to 42 million compared to the prior year the significant improvement was due to a 16 increase in becker revenue due to enhanced marketing effectiveness while acams increased almost 65 due in part to the impact of the planned timing shift of the north american annual conference from fiscal q1 in the prior year to fiscal 2q in 2019 revenue associated with this conference totaled approximately 5 million during the quarter segment operating income was 9 6 million compared to 2 2 million in the prior year driven by revenue growth across both becker and acams second quarter technology and business segment revenue totaled 62 6 million a decrease of 16 6 and down 2 4 on a constant currency basis the decreases included lower tuition pricing necessary to offset the effect of student financial aid program reductions and increased competition however the segment is well positioned for new student enrollment growth in its online platforms segment operating income in the second quarter was 8 5 million compared to 14 million in the prior year second quarter operating income on a constant currency basis was 10 6 million the operating income reduction in the quarter was primarily driven by lower revenue the brazilian government recently changed regulations on opening and operating distance learning in the country the approval process for launching online facilities was streamlined making this segment more economically attractive to larger institutions adtalem brazil began offering several bachelors and associates degree programs via distance learning in february 2018 these programs are offered under the wyden online brand they are delivered through the damásio network of over 200 learning centers which is currently has the infrastructure and staff necessary to support distance learning degrees 2 085 new students enrolled in wyden online in the september 2018 session our effective tax rate from continuing operations excluding special items was 17 in the second quarter now turning to our balance sheet and financial position cash flow from operations for the first six months of fiscal 2019 totaled 23 million compared to 50 million in the prior year fiscal year to date capital expenditures totaled 35 million compared to 32 million in the prior year our net accounts receivable at december 31 2018 was 139 million an increase of 3 3 driven by the timing of financial aid receipts for the first six months of the fiscal year bad debt as a percentage of revenue was 1 1 compared to 1 3 in the prior year reflecting the quality of our programs and solid student outcomes we closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 295 million and outstanding bank borrowings of 299 million we are committed to maintaining a healthy balance sheet to support our growth strategy and enhance shareholder returns during the first six months of fiscal year 2019 we repurchased approximately 2 4 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 49 01 per share for a total of 115 9 million in january 2019 we completed our 10th share repurchase program we are now buying back shares under the 300 million program approved by our board last november 2018 we remain confident and committed to executing our long term strategic plan including share repurchasing as a part of our capital allocation strategy now turning to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter of 2019 we expect revenue to grow 1 to 2 compared to the prior year we expect third quarter 2019 operating costs before special items to increase 3 to 4 compared to the prior year the third quarter outlook assumes an exchange rate of brl 3 77 to the u s dollar consistent with our previous fiscal 2019 full year outlook we expect revenue to increase approximately 3 to 4 compared to the prior year and earnings per share from continuing operations before special items to grow in the 2 to 3 range compared to the prior year we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be in the 16 to 17 range the full year outlook assumes an exchange rate of brl 3 8 to the u s dollar full year capital spending is expected to be in the 65 million to 70 million range including approximately 20 million to 25 million for the relocation of rusm to barbados with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for q a questions and answers operator thank you and thank you our first question comes from the line of peter appert with piper jaffray please proceed peter appert piper jaffray analyst thanks good afternoon so maybe you could just expand a little bit on what you re seeing in brazil you highlighted increased competition and i guess the fies exposure is an issue seems like those issues might persist what would give you some confidence that you can improve the financial results there lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes hi peter so a couple of things certainly while we believe that the macro environment is stabilizing somewhat with a new administration etc we certainly understand that we don t have the controllables there as we look at our market we ve seen pricing pressure primarily on the wyden institution so separate from the ibmec online etc there s a couple of things there one is that pricing pressure a lot of it is coming from the fies our students there are using fies our fies percentage now is around 18 across all of our portfolio certainly below 20 which is less than half of what it was just a couple of years ago and then as we look at pricing we certainly become more competitive in the market at the wyden institution but we are focused on a couple of things making sure that we re differentiating those programs so that they are not as price sensitive we certainly have had some successes there in that trending the right way we are seeing growth in that segment as you look at the enrollment since it s fixed and then as we look wyden on site very early on in online very early on in that program what we re seeing that come through on the damásio channel and obviously that s going to do that and improve our operating margins because that s flowing through to the bottom line not as much as the of the on site variable cost so i think between that and some of the things that we re doing in the ibmec program and with that brand we re seeing really good growth there across some of the new programs partnerships etc we re pretty confident that we are going to be able to face those headwinds in brazil as it relates to currency etc no doubt there s a return so we re in a market in that type of emerging market but we are really well positioned from a brand perspective from a product differentiation perspective from a program perspective and across different elements of that market where we re pretty confident patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer we re peter seeing very nice continuation of a build in our new student enrollments in response to some of the pricing actions we ve taken so if you recall back in september new student enrollments in brazil were up about 24 it s a very successful continuation of our online launch even excluding that the base business new student enrollments were up almost 9 5 so as we come into the key enrollment cycle here in february and march and where we stand we re feeling increasingly confident on a nice continuation of those trends peter appert piper jaffray analyst got it ok thank you for that and then on the on nursing it really feels like the tale of two stories here right the rn the bsn quite weak the pre licensure quite strong anything you can do or anything structurally pricing wise marketing wise i m not sure what to perhaps stabilize the rn to bsn side of things lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes i mean we certainly if you look at rn to bsn in terms of the decline we re closing that gap and a lot of that has to do certainly with the marketing and some of the operational things we re trying to do to drive that as you look at part of it is the overall market and we discussed that before and we feel that certainly it s good to be positioned with the on site if you look at the a 31 growth there helps us understand that the market is shifting a bit while we see some of the pricing and some of the competitive trends there one of the things that we really are focusing on peter is thinking about how we can continue to work our hospital system and partnership systems there so that we continue to decrease those marketing costs and we re getting those students directly i mean ochsner as a collocation is a perfect example but certainly with a more aggressive look at that across the portfolio so yes certainly understand that but we feel like we ve got the right actions in place on both sides of those and very confident on the on site as the market continues to shift peter appert piper jaffray analyst and sticking with that for a sec lisa if you the ochsner relationship obviously has worked really well for you any thoughts in terms of new campus locations perhaps with other hospital partners lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes so obviously we wanted to prove out that model for one quarter doesn t a trend make we feel that we re at that point now where we are really stepping up across that across chamberlain university in general our partnership discussions we are not at a point now where we can identify here s the next one but certainly we ve identified this is a model that works for us works for the hospital partners so as we start to think more about solving the pain points for a hospital system across there to work for us model this partnership with ochsner really helps us understand how to do that better and we re able to really do what are the cost that we re able to save and streamline because of that so we are actively looking as you may recall we have a new campus a next one in terms of a stand alone or a chamberlain university campus is scheduled for san antonio texas that is on track and so we will open that but absolutely stocked of being able to do something in parallel should we get the right partner and we ve got a few in the funnel patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer is it peter just to add with that we ve seen very nice increases in our enrollment caps based on the continuation of very solid nclex results so we ve seen caps increased in michigan las vegas north brunswick new jersey so as that market continues to shift as lisa said we re really well positioned with our campus footprint but increasingly so our ability to increase the campus size is to meet that market demand peter appert piper jaffray analyst right understood and last thing and i ll let someone else get on pat the guide would suggest very strong fiscal fourth quarter numbers i think if i m doing my math correctly can you just highlight some of the things that are really causing the inflection in the results later in the year patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer yes that s very much consistent with our point of view increasingly as we exit fiscal 2019 and then start to see an acceleration of both revenue and earnings in fiscal 2020 we ll start to all share that and see that in the fourth quarter driven by the continuation of the very nice build in total student enrollments at chamberlain increasingly as we see total student enrollments build at brazil and then with the increased contribution and the nice stability that we re seeing with becker in prof ed those all coming together quite nicely and then of course the inherent leverage in the business is that flows through the bottom line to see both revenue and earnings grow peter appert piper jaffray analyst great thank you guys lisa wardell president and chief executive officer thanks peter operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff silber with bmo capital markets please proceed jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thank you so much wanted to focus on margins for the medical and healthcare business they were down somewhat year over year and i know there was some noise in terms of a timing shift and maybe some relocation costs will we expect margins on a year over year basis in that segment to be up year over year in the second half patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer on a full year basis we d expect margins to be somewhat comparable to slightly lower just slightly lower than prior year full year fy 18 just as a result of a little bit of that noise you referenced in some higher absorption of home office cost but as we move into 2020 then we ll start to see the margins expand with the benefit of the growing enrollments jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok great that s helpful and just focusing on the i think you said there was a 31 year over year increase in enrollments on campus in your bsn program i knew you had a number of caps lifted if i remember correctly there were also some new schools that were open do you have that on a same school basis excluding the caps i m just trying to normalize what the growth was patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer really as you look about it with the way we think about it this is on a same school basis with the exception of ochsner which would ve contributed about 30 new student enrollments jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok wow that s a pretty good number and then you had mentioned in your prepared remarks i think you called it additional business development activities across the portfolio if we can just get a little bit more color on what you re referring to lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes sure so really as we look at his back half of 19 this is really the first time that we ve been able to clear out a lot of the noise as you can imagine a lot of our resources and focus across the certainly across home office and the entire portfolio has been very focused on both divestitures as well as the relocation and so as we go into back half of the year we have been having a lot more conversations across the portfolio as it relates to how we can better serve our employers but we have employer relationships obviously the hospital systems but multinational finance institutions on the acams and becker side we re starting to see traction in terms of partnerships and potential partnerships to cross sell within professional education between becker and acams we had mentioned it before but really was more of a paper exercise versus getting those partnerships in place on the medical side as an example auc now having a campus where we won t actually have students in september on the uclan campus in the u k small class to start but certainly a growth potential there as we build that incremental students and revenue for us on the ross med side articulation agreements where we announced charles drew we have several others that will be announced in the next month or so or actually this month that will allow us to both drive students lower marketing costs that type of things so we re really getting out as we now have this group president model that we think about at the last person to fill that team out for me i mentioned before was kathy boden holland on the medical healthcare group just last may june timeframe so now with the relo of ross complete and having a permanent home there we are geared up to do what we do quite well when we have the time and capacity and that is to develop relationships that drive new student enrollment across the portfolio jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst ok great thank you so much lisa wardell president and chief executive officer welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex paris of barrington research please proceed chris howe barrington research analyst good afternoon this is chris howe sitting in for alex my first question is you touched on it many times and provided some great color on this just in regard to acams and becker you mentioned the longer term guidance for acams prior to this call how should we look at these two businesses on a longer term basis beyond this fiscal year where would you say it is as far as its runway for growth and its contribution to longer term guidance patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer no great question chris and we are very much in line in tracking with the longer term guidance that we ve provided back in may at investor day that we would see very nice continuation of double digit revenue growth and then see a very nice flow through and margins continuing to expand over time but as we continue to reinvest in the business so very much on track with what we had shared in our five year plan and very pleased to see some very nice stabilization of becker and a continuation of those trends chris howe barrington research analyst that s great thank you pat and this leads me to my follow up question lisa touched on it a little bit about the different cross selling opportunities between becker and acams where would you say you are as far as the awareness of these opportunities and the realization of monetizing the cross selling opportunities here lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes sure i would say the good news is that it s early stage in terms of the easy for me to say making revenue from that but in terms of awareness it s very high right because we now have a as i mentioned to group president that is able to shift in and among the institutions as well as obviously the folks who run those institutions and sort of putting in some new talent six to nine months ago or almost a year now for acams is really starting to pay dividends as we see these connections so i think accounting for stem is just early stage we re seeing lots of different things that we re able to do as we think about not only the acams model but what are the other places in terms of certifications etc that we d be able to use that model because we are recognized in the market as it relates to certifications etc so more to come there but certainly feel like we have a long runway for that in terms of revenue but probably five or six out of 10 in terms of our awareness as we talk to our employers customers etc chris howe barrington research analyst very helpful that s all the questions i have right now operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff mueler with baird please proceed jeff meuler baird analyst yes thank you maybe to start just i guess glass half empty take on the guidance question the q3 guidance could you just given that really strong implied q4 is there anything in q3 that we should be considering from a timing or comp perspective or something along those lines just given that there s i guess slower growth in q3 and i know q2 benefited from the timing of the acams conference but just any other comments or considerations for q3 guidance patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer yes jeff we will have and once we re out of q3 of next year have overlapped some of the noise from the hurricanes so if you go back and look we ve been very transparent in our prior disclosures on the quantification there but of course there was a shift of revenue as we needed to delay classes for a couple of weeks so revenue that we would ve normally taught in would have recognized in the second quarter had shifted into the third quarter the prior year so we ll be overcoming a little bit of that and then of course just the seasonality of the third quarter is one of our weaker in earnings because brazil isn t teaching but just a month and a half in that quarter and then that s we ll obviously see the nice acceleration and again as we sit here today very much unchanged from our full year guidance in terms of both revenue and eps lisa wardell president and chief executive officer right so i was just going to add you know me jeff to make it the glass half full i would say we ve got significant upside and confidence in our q4 particularly as some of these other corporate development initiatives are driving through the portfolio so very confident in our full year guidance and again as patrick said been very transparent about what s shifted as it relates to q3 jeff meuler baird analyst got it and then on the nursing enrollment cap increases i guess to what extent is that a direct link to the improved nclex passage rates and can increased caps kind of become a regular thing that we see year in and year out lisa wardell president and chief executive officer yes so it is a direct correlation each state as you know this is part of our competitive differentiation because each state s board of nursing makes these distinctions particularly when you start talking about when you become uncapped as in new brunswick and then it s all about your capacity to take new students and so we absolutely anticipate that that will continue when you think about our this our three newest campuses all testing at 100 pass rate for the nclex students that came through sacramento etc the newer campuses we would anticipate that those caps would get lifted obviously a lot earlier depending upon our ability to continue to show post those kind of nclex scores so while the academic quality piece is the most important to us just because our mission is education it really does tie very nicely to how we think about financial metrics and revenue growth jeff meuler baird analyst ok and then becker a really impressive turnaround there i guess i m just trying to vet the sustainability or how we could think about or how you think about underlying growth potential of that business following the changes to product to marketing patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer yes so very much see this is being very sustainable as we ve pivoted specifically in sharpening our value prop and our competitive pricing in the b2c side of the business that represents about 30 of becker s overall revenue so we have seen a very strong market response to the improved product and some of the pricing changes and we re starting to see a continuation of that into the current quarter and again as we ve stacked three four quarters in a roll here we re increasingly confident in terms of the stabilization of that business and then i think as we think about becker more strategically the continued growth of the continued professional education so look we help 40 000 students a year prepare and start their careers as cpa and now we want to leverage that reputation the impact that we ve had in keeping them in the career with continuing professional education and we ve had some very nice wins lately with some large accounting firms and helping them solve some workforce problems so we re really starting to see a nice continuation and growing becker beyond just being known for the cpa test prep jeff meuler baird analyst ok and then last one for me lisa could you just help me better understand steven s role with the promotion i guess from my perspective usually i see coos have you there p l or some sort of business unit responsibility so the description reads a little different and then i think he also leads ir but he doesn t have a formal role on conference calls so just if you could just maybe talk about that promotion and his role thanks lisa wardell president and chief executive officer sure absolutely so it actually ties directly to some of the things that i ve been talking about here but obviously in general terms because we wanted to make sure that we re ticked and tied and announce and that s really on the strategic strategy and corporate development side and so if you think about what i have done in the past and actually what steve did in his past role it s really around corporate development business development relationships certainly m a we have both organic and inorganic as we think about across the longer strategic time horizon and so his role in terms of adding the chief operating officer is really to enable us to have that capacity and have someone who can drive these things from start to finish as we work with the group presidents and think about how we can better position ourselves as it relates to being responsive to employers beyond the institutions themselves obviously that is important as we educate but beyond that as we think about how do we have life long learners and how do we drive through the workforce or employer sort of life cycle and student life cycle that s something that he can really be helpful with as we think about his past experience and then how he interacts in and among the institutions and the units here jeff meuler baird analyst ok thank you lisa wardell president and chief executive officer well we would like to thank everybody for joining the adtalem global education q2 conference call we really appreciate your support and we look forward to talking to you next quarter patrick unzicker chief financial officer and treasurer ok thank you everybody

for two years in the early 1990s richard palmer served as the cia station chief in the united states moscow embassy the events unfolding around him the dissolution of the soviet union and the rise of russia were so chaotic so traumatic and exhilarating that they mostly eluded clearheaded analysis but from all the intelligence that washed over his desk palmer acquired a crystalline understanding of the deeper narrative of those times much of the rest of the world wanted to shout for joy about the trajectory of history and how it pointed in the direction of free markets and liberal democracy palmer s account of events in russia however was pure bummer in the fall of 1999 he testified before a congressional committee to disabuse members of congress of their optimism and to warn them of what was to come american officialdom palmer believed had badly misjudged russia washington had placed its faith in the new regime s elites it took them at their word when they professed their commitment to democratic capitalism but palmer had seen up close how the world s growing interconnectedness and global finance in particular could be deployed for ill during the cold war the kgb had developed an expert understanding of the banking byways of the west and spymasters had become adept at dispensing cash to agents abroad that proficiency facilitated the amassing of new fortunes in the dying days of the u s s r palmer had watched as his old adversaries in soviet intelligence shoveled billions from the state treasury into private accounts across europe and the u s it was one of history s greatest heists washington told itself a comforting story that minimized the importance of this outbreak of kleptomania these were criminal outliers and rogue profiteers rushing to exploit the weakness of the new state this narrative infuriated palmer he wanted to shake congress into recognizing that the thieves were the very elites who presided over every corner of the system for the u s to be like russia is today he explained to the house committee it would be necessary to have massive corruption by the majority of the members at congress as well as by the departments of justice and treasury and agents of the fbi cia dia irs marshal service border patrol state and local police officers the federal reserve bank supreme court justices in his testimony palmer even mentioned russia s newly installed and little known prime minister whom he mistakenly referred to as boris putin accusing him of helping to loot russia the united states palmer made clear had allowed itself to become an accomplice in this plunder his assessment was unsparing the west could have turned away this stolen cash it could have stanched the outflow to shell companies and tax havens instead western banks waved russian loot into their vaults palmer s anger was intended to provoke a bout of introspection and to fuel anxiety about the risk that rising kleptocracy posed to the west itself after all the russians would have a strong interest in protecting their relocated assets they would want to shield this wealth from moralizing american politicians who might clamor to seize it eighteen years before special counsel robert mueller began his investigation into foreign interference in a u s election palmer warned congress about russian political donations to u s politicians and political parties to obtain influence what was at stake could well be systemic contagion russian values might infect and then weaken the moral defense systems of american politics and business this unillusioned spook was a prophet and he spoke out at a hinge moment in the history of global corruption america could not afford to delude itself into assuming that it would serve as the virtuous model much less emerge as an untainted bystander yet when yegor gaidar a reformist russian prime minister in the earliest postcommunist days asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had carted away the white house refused capital flight is capital flight was how one former cia official summed up the american rationale for idly standing by but this was capital flight on an unprecedented scale and mere prologue to an era of rampant theft when the berkeley economist gabriel zucman studied the problem in 2015 he found that 52 percent of russia s wealth resided outside the country the collapse of communism in the other post soviet states along with china s turn toward capitalism only added to the kleptocratic fortunes that were hustled abroad for secret safekeeping officials around the world have always looted their countries coffers and accumulated bribes but the globalization of banking made the export of their ill gotten money far more convenient than it had been which of course inspired more theft by one estimate more than 1 trillion now exits the world s developing countries each year in the forms of laundered money and evaded taxes as in the russian case much of this plundered wealth finds its way to the united states new york los angeles and miami have joined london as the world s most desired destinations for laundered money this boom has enriched the american elites who have enabled it and it has degraded the nation s political and social mores in the process while everyone else was heralding an emergent globalist world that would take on the best values of america palmer had glimpsed the dire risk of the opposite that the values of the kleptocrats would become america s own this grim vision is now nearing fruition the contagion has spread remarkably quickly which is not to say steadily in a country haunted since its founding by the perils of corruption the united states has had seizures of conscience en route to the top of the new global order surveyed by the british journalist oliver bullough in his excellent book moneyland why thieves and crooks now rule the world and how to take it back in the months following palmer s testimony the zeitgeist swerved in the direction he urged at least momentarily newspaper articles in the fall of 1999 showed how billions in russian money some of it seemingly tied to an alleged crime boss had landed in the bank of new york these sums startled bill clinton s administration which readied tough new anti money laundering bills designed to stiffen banking regulations but the administration was in its last year and passing any new law would have required a legislative slog and bull rushing obstreperous lobbyists so plans stalled the clinton era proposals would have remained an unvisited curio in the national archives had osama bin laden not attacked but in the days after the twin towers collapsed george w bush s administration furiously scoured washington for ideas to jam into the 342 page piece of legislation that would become the patriot act a sense of national panic created a brief moment for bureaucrats to realize previously shelved plans title iii of the patriot act the international money laundering abatement and anti terrorist financing act was signed into law little more than a month after september 11 this section of the bill was a monumental legislative achievement undeterred by the smoke clouds of crisis representatives of the big banks had stalked the senate trying to quash the measure citibank officials reportedly got into shouting matches with congressional staffers in the hall this anger reflected the force of the patriot act if a bank came across suspicious money transferred from abroad it was now required to report the transfer to the government a bank could face criminal charges for failing to establish sufficient safeguards against the flow of corrupt cash little wonder that banks fought fiercely against the imposition of so many new rules which required them to bulk up their compliance divisions and more to the point subjected them to expensive penalties for laxity much of what palmer had urged was suddenly the law of the land but nestled in the patriot act lay the handiwork of another industry s lobbyists every house district in the country has real estate and lobbyists for that business had pleaded for relief from the patriot act s monitoring of dubious foreign transactions they all but conjured up images of suburban moms staking for sale signs on lawns ill equipped to vet every buyer and they persuaded congress to grant the industry a temporary exemption from having to enforce the new law the exemption was a gaping loophole and an extraordinary growth opportunity for high end real estate for all the new fastidiousness of the financial system foreigners could still buy penthouse apartments or mansions anonymously and with ease by hiding behind shell companies set up in states such as delaware and nevada those states along with a few others had turned the registration of shell companies into a hugely lucrative racket and it was stunningly simple to arrange such a potemkin front on behalf of a dictator a drug dealer or an oligarch according to global witness a london based anti corruption ngo founded in 1993 procuring a library card requires more identification in many states than does creating an anonymous shell company much of the money that might have snuck into banks before the patriot act became law was now used to purchase property the new york times described the phenomenon in a series of exposés published in 2015 called towers of secrecy reporters discovered that condos in the ultra luxe time warner center at columbus circle in manhattan were owned by a constellation of kleptocrats one condo belonged to the family of a former russian senator whose suspected ties to organized crime precluded him from legally entering canada for a few years a condo down the hall belonged to a greek businessman who had recently been arrested in an anti government corruption sweep the family of a former colombian governor imprisoned for self enrichment while in office owned a unit he could no longer visit these denizens all of whom denied wrongdoing made their high priced purchases in what has become a common way nationwide nearly half of homes worth at least 5 million the times found were bought using shell companies the proportion was even greater in los angeles and manhattan where more than 80 percent of time warner center sales fit that description as the treasury department put it in 2017 nearly one in three high end real estate purchases that it monitors involves an individual whom the government has been tracking as suspicious yet somehow the presence of so many shady buyers has never especially troubled the real estate industry or for that matter politicians in 2013 new york city s then mayor michael bloomberg asked wouldn t it be great if we could get all the russian billionaires to move here the warm welcome has created a strange dissonance in american policy take the case of the aluminum magnate oleg deripaska a character who has made recurring cameos in the investigation of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election the state department concerned about deripaska s connections to russian organized crime which he has denied has restricted his travel to the united states for years such fears have not stood in the way of his acquiring a 42 5 million mansion on manhattan s upper east side and another estate near washington s embassy row over time the gap between the noble intentions of the patriot act and the dirty reality of the property market became too wide to ignore in 2016 barack obama s administration tested a program to bring the real estate industry in line with the banks compelling brokers to report foreign buyers too the ongoing program piloted in miami and manhattan could have become the scaffolding for a truly robust enforcement regime but then the american presidency turned over and a landlord came to power obama s successor liked selling condos to anonymous foreign buyers and may have grown dependent on their cash in 2017 reuters examined the sale of trump organization properties in florida it found that 77 of 2 044 units in the developments were owned by russians but that was likely an incomplete portrait more than one third of the units had been sold to corporate vehicles which can readily hide the identity of the true owner as oliver bullough remarks they might have belonged to vladimir putin for all anyone else could know around the time that trump took up occupancy in the white house the patriot act s temporary exemption for real estate entered its 15th year without anyone ever declaring it so the ephemeral has been enshrined the war on kleptocracy had meanwhile been lurching forward on another front if foreign plutocrats remained mostly unscathed as they made themselves at home in the u s american plutocrats eager to hide their fortunes abroad faced fresh trouble in 2007 the united states experienced one of its bouts of moral clarity jolted by the confessions of a banker named bradley birkenfeld who came clean to the department of justice he would later tell his story in a book called lucifer s banker what he freely divulged to prosecutors were his client recruiting efforts on behalf of ubs the swiss banking behemoth birkenfeld described how he had ensconced himself in the gilded heart of the american plutocracy attending yacht regattas and patronizing art galleries he would mingle with the wealthy and strike up conversation what i can do for you is zero he would say and then pause before the punch line actually it s three zeroes zero income tax zero capital gains tax and zero inheritance tax birkenfeld s unsubtle approach succeeded wildly as did his bank as part of an agreement with the justice department ubs admitted to hiding assets totaling some 20 billion in american money the scale of the hidden cash spun congress into a fury in 2010 it passed the foreign account tax compliance act fatca legislation with moral clout that belies its stodgy name never again would a foreign bank be able to hold american cash without notifying the irs or without risking a walloping fine here was anti corruption leadership at work and u s waffling on display according to one powerful strain of american exceptionalism the nation boasts superior financial hygiene and a bedrock culture of good government indeed the u s government has devoted more attention to money laundering than perhaps any other nation on the planet but the bar isn t very high and the vigilance has its limits in 2011 the obama administration sought to collect more information about foreigners bank accounts and to share it with the relevant home countries but banks along with their lobbyists and intellectual mouthpieces worked furiously to prevent the expansion a fellow at the heritage foundation denounced the proposed standards as fiscal imperialism the president of the florida bankers association said at a time when we are trying to create jobs and reduce the burden on businesses this is the wrong issue bankers associations in texas california and new york followed suit the effort went nowhere in congress the pattern repeated itself when the organization for economic cooperation and development following the original fatca example took the congressional template and extended it each year banks would report foreign accounts to the tax authorities in the account holders home country if every nation had signed on to the oecd standards the effect would have been a hammerblow to tax havens shattering the vital infrastructure that allows kleptocratic money to flow unnoticed in the end the united states was alone in refusing to join the oecd agreement finalized in 2014 this obstinacy stood to subvert everything the country had done to lead the fight against dirty money while the u s can ask almost any other nation s banks for financial information about american citizens it has no obligation to provide other countries with the same the united states had bullied the rest of the world into scrapping financial secrecy bullough writes but hadn t applied the same standards to itself a zurich based lawyer vividly spelled out the consequences to bloomberg how ironic no how perverse that the usa which has been so sanctimonious in its condemnation of swiss banks has become the banking secrecy jurisdiction du jour that giant sucking sound you hear it is the sound of money rushing to the usa not long before the u s declined to sign on to the oecd standards a branch office of the baronial rothschild bank opened on the 12th floor of a building in reno nevada far away in miles and spirit from the home office in paris the bank s name wasn t announced on the exterior of the building or even listed in the lobby directory soon after the reno outpost opened one of the bank s managing directors introduced the new branch s services to potential clients in san francisco what made the presentation so memorable were the ideas included in a draft procured by bloomberg the script laid bare the reasons for wealthy foreigners to funnel money through nevada the state is the ideal place to hide money from governments and avoid paying u s taxes the draft acknowledged a truth that bankers don t usually admit in public which is that the united states has little appetite for helping foreign governments retrieve money laundered within its borders in fact it has grown into the biggest tax haven in the world the firm said these statements were removed before the presentation was delivered because they did not reflect the firm s real views what changed wasn t just regulatory structure the behavior of the american elite changed too members of the professional classes competed to sell their services to kleptocrats in the course of that competition they breezed past old ethical prohibitions and the pressure rose to test the limits of the law a collection of videos on the internet filmed in 2014 illustrates this moral collapse the clips never show the face of a man introduced as ralph kayser a german who reveals only the most elemental details about himself recited in lightly accented english he has lined up a succession of meetings with 13 law firms in manhattan in which he engages in pleasantries and then announces his purpose he works as an adviser to a government official in one of these mineral rich countries in west africa he explains over a long career the official has grown quite wealthy companies are eager to get hold of rare earth or other minerals and so they pay some special money for it i wouldn t name it bribe i would say facilitation money kayser s client he continues is getting older and because the client s wife has always wanted a new york brownstone and the client is in the market for a gulfstream and a yacht he has a sudden need to transport money into the united states the client prefers that his purchases remain a tightly held secret so as not to provoke attention back in his home country it would look at least very very embarrassing kayser makes hardly any effort to disguise his desire to move suspect funds that is entirely by design kayser is actually a character devised by global witness the london based ngo the actor is outfitted with a well concealed camera to capture the american lawyers displaying their ethical proclivities although none of the lawyers kayser visits takes him on as a client and several say they need more information about the source of the official s wealth only one flatly refuses to discuss ways to move the money kayser has not it should be said selected the law offices of saul goodman his targets include attorneys at white shoe firms of course they understand the risks of moving suspect cash into new york one lawyer tells kayser i ve gotta be very careful myself i don t wanna do something looks like i m laundering money and that would cost me my license and and i just don t do that just what sort of scrutiny he generally applies though isn t clear when i get money from my other clients he admits it always comes in with some strange name on it i don t even ask another lawyer blithely announces they don t send lawyers to jail because we run the country we re still members of a privileged class in this country global witness conducted its experiment to point out big law s complicity in the spread of kleptocracy but the footage also provides primary anthropology of an american elite a profession like law has highly developed ethical codes yet those codes appear to have receded in recent years even the most prestigious firms find themselves fretful about the survival of their high priced business model which was profoundly rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the corporate cost cutting that followed greedy impulses have surely always existed within the white shoe world but the sense of darwinian struggle and the norms of a global elite have eroded boundaries the same partners who shed underachieving colleagues more ruthlessly than they used to also seem primed to adopt a more permissive attitude toward clients whom they might once have rejected this decay has been on full display in robert mueller s investigation we have seen how the firm skadden arps slate meagher flom a sturdy pillar of the legal profession placed itself in the service of kleptocracy one partner at the firm from 2010 to 2018 gregory craig had served as barack obama s white house counsel the man responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the presidency at skadden he oversaw the creation of a report that was used to justify ukrainian president viktor yanukovych s arrest of his primary political opponent on what were widely viewed as highly dubious grounds the firm according to testimony in mueller s investigation said privately that evidence to support the arrest was virtually nonexistent another lawyer who worked for skadden has pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors during the mueller team s probe of the firm s ukrainian work the ukrainians hired skadden through a middleman the now jailed political consultant paul manafort once upon a time it might have been possible to think of manafort as a grubby outlier in washington the lobbyist with the lowest standards willing to take on the most egregious clients but mueller has exposed just how tightly tethered manafort s work on behalf of ukrainian kleptocrats was to washington s permanent elite manafort subcontracted some of his lobbying to the firm of tony podesta arguably the most powerful democratic influence peddler of his generation and manafort employed mercury public affairs where he dealt with vin weber a former republican congressman and a former chairman of the national endowment for democracy america s fear of kleptocracy goes back to its founding in 1785 benjamin franklin returned from paris where he had served as a representative of american interests he brought home a bejeweled gift which incited controversy the grandest item in his possession it was a portrait of louis xvi outlined by 408 diamonds and stored in a golden case this present was often referred to as a snuffbox a name that seemed intended to obscure its grandeur it symbolized everything that franklin s generation despised about europe and its debasements there gift giving was a standard diplomatic custom but a gift might cloud the judgment of a public official and risked undermining the allegiances of the recipient it represented the possible elevation of personal gain over commitment to the public good the perils of corruption were an obsession of the founders in the summer of 1787 james madison mentioned corruption in his notebook 54 times to read the transcripts of the various constitutional conventions is to see just how much that generation worried about the moral quality of public behavior and how much it wanted to create a system that defined corruption more expansively than the french or british systems had and that fostered a political culture with higher ethical ambitions in her important history corruption in america zephyr teachout a legal scholar and liberal activist argues that during the country s first 200 years courts maintained the founders vigilance against corruption for a good chunk of american history a number of states criminalized lobbying in many forms out of a sense that a loosening of standards would trigger a race to the bottom that near phobia now looks quaint and also prescient the political culture the legal culture the banking culture so much of the culture of the self congratulatory meritocratic elite have long since abandoned such prudish ways the defining document of our era is the supreme court s citizens united decision in 2010 the ruling didn t just legalize anonymous expenditures on political campaigns it redefined our very idea of what constitutes corruption limiting it to its most blatant forms the bribe and the explicit quid pro quo justice anthony kennedy s majority opinion crystallized an ever more prevalent ethos of indifference the collective shrug in response to tax avoidance by the rich and by large corporations the yawn that now greets the millions in dark money spent by invisible billionaires to influence elections in other words the united states has legitimized a political economy of shadows and it has done so right in step with a global boom in people hoping to escape into the shadows american collusion with kleptocracy comes at a terrible cost for the rest of the world all of the stolen money all of those evaded tax dollars sunk into central park penthouses and nevada shell companies might otherwise fund health care and infrastructure a report from the anti poverty group one has argued that 3 6 million deaths each year can be attributed to this sort of resource siphoning thievery tramples the possibilities of workable markets and credible democracy it fuels suspicions that the whole idea of liberal capitalism is a hypocritical sham while the world is plundered self righteous americans get rich off their complicity with the crooks the founders were concerned that venality would become standard procedure and it has long before suspicion mounted about the loyalties of donald trump large swaths of the american elite lawyers lobbyists real estate brokers politicians in state capitals who enabled the creation of shell companies had already proved themselves to be reliable servants of a rapacious global plutocracy richard palmer was right the looting elites of the former soviet union were far from rogue profiteers they augured a kleptocratic habit that would soon become widespread one bitter truth about the russia scandal is that by the time vladimir putin attempted to influence the shape of our country it was already bending in the direction of his
it is now almost two years since we warned of the dangers of wearing brexit goggles of seeing the world as a feature of brexit rather than the other way around wearing the brexit goggles restricts your view so everything appears to be about brexit trade investment jobs security phone costs social security animal health etc as for politics but as we said back then beware the brexit goggles by design they have an excessive focus on brexit which means they filter out other important news take a few examples from the past week of stuff that didn t exactly dominate the headlines here italy france france recalled its ambassador from italy to protest at interference in french internal affairs by a faction of the italian government namely the five star party it is not quite breaking off diplomatic relations but it is a very serious step particularly when you consider that these two g7 countries are next door neighbours and founding members of the eu and the euro how serious the last time this happened was 1940 when the fascist regime attacked france in support of their nazi allies that serious the immediate cause is a meeting in france between luigi di maio the leader of five star and a group of gilet jaune protesters meeting political parties in the run up to the european elections in may is one thing but french president emmanuel macron is furious that another eu government leader would meet with a group that has brought very violent protest to the streets of paris destabilising his government and weakening the french economy a riot induced weakness mentioned in the european commission s growth forecast more on that below mr macron has also complained of a series of insults from the italian government towards france but this goes way beyond insults and appears to be a sign of how seriously european government particularly the french are taking the threat of destabilisation in the european elections mr di maio and his five star movement have been publicly lauded by steve bannon he of trump election and brexit fame who is also working with marine le pen s national front now known as the national rally and others across the continent in what he calls the movement to bring brexit trump tactics to bear on the european parliament elections but the brexit goggles only let us glimpse the insult from donald tusk about the special place in hell for brexit leaders or the destabilisation of the tory party venezuela last monday eu foreign ministers were due to agree a common position on venezuela in which all the eu states would refuse to recognise nicholas maduro as president of the south american country and instead recognising the speaker of congress juan guaido as the legitimate ruler until there are fresh elections under eu rules unanimity is required but italy s five star party would not agree so the common position failed it was then up to individual countries to take their own positions ireland declared its recognition of juan guaido as interim president on wednesday in a statement from minister for foreign affairs simon coveney recognising a challenger to an incumbent head of government is not something the irish or most other governments do lightly the situation in venezuela is becoming critical this diplomatic action is significant as is the failure of the eu system to add value to the diplomacy in a whole is greater than the sum of the parts way a radical shift in irish diplomacy and a stunning reversal for the eu s diplomacy filtered out by brexit goggles which only allow us to see the diplomatic efforts of theresa may in brussels belfast and dublin tánaiste simoncoveney announces ireland s support for mr juan guaidó full statement available at pic twitter com kgisqktncr irish foreign ministry dfatirl february 6 2019 nuclear weapons in throwing in its lot with guaido against maduro ireland has lined up with the rest of europe except italy and the us but maduro is supported by russia this week russia followed the us in abandoning the intermediate nuclear forces treaty a 1980s agreement not to develop and deploy intermediate range missiles remember intermediate range means missiles that are designed to drop atom bombs in the space west of moscow and east of shannon in other words we are the target europe is the nuclear battlefield but if you ve got brexit goggles on the only battlefield you see is over the backstop and while the threat of violence in northern ireland is more likely the consequences of nuclear war are more consequential the ultimate black swan event pay attention the economy and growth brexit goggles give the wearer fantastic insight into the economic consequences of brexit in amazing detail shedding light on the most arcane aspects of trade customs and freight forwarding to the exclusion of almost everything else of economic consequence yes it a big economic event potentially a devastating one especially if it proves to be the trigger event that sets off a new european possibly even global recession it is not that brexit in itself is enough to cause a recession it hits the irish agri food industry extremely hard but the rest of the economy is largely discommoded not devastated and it s the same but to a lesser extent for the rest of the eu it s real global significance is as a potential trigger causing a general loss of confidence rather like the loss of confidence in the inter bank lending market that caused the credit crunch in august 2007 which led to well you get the picture in and of itself brexit is just one more straw in the load being piled on the back of the beast that is the global economy the question is will it be the straw the final straw the one that breaks the back after all things are not going well in the wider world economy where a slowdown in china is feeding through to the rest of the world from mobile phones to cars to computers and all the global supply chains that feed those industries the slowdown is becoming palpable thursday s shock news from jaguar land rover a jewel in the crown of british manufacturing industry which announced a 3 4bn loss in q3 was mainly due to falling sales in china and a drop in european and uk sales because of a move away from diesel by consumers these are long term trends not the short term issue of brexit by the way jaguar s battery powered suvs are made in austria by a contract manufacturer while land rover has opened a new factory in slovakia meanwhile it is cutting jobs in the uk again it s not due to brexit but brexit isn t helping then there is america most observers of the us economy are increasingly of the view that it is at the peak of this cycle so the only way is down despite the sugar hit from the tax cuts certainly the fed as abruptly about faced on interest rate hikes and brexit does not bother us business much on thursday the european commission marked down its growth forecasts for the eu and its states pierre moscovici the economics commissioner said after its 2017 peak the eu economy s deceleration is set to continue in 2019 to growth of 1 5 this slowdown is set to be more pronounced than expected last autumn especially in the euro area due to global trade uncertainties and domestic factors in our largest economies here is the short version of the commission s view on the state of the economy economic activity moderated in the second half of last year as global trade growth slowed uncertainty sapped confidence and output in some member states was adversely affected by temporary domestic factors such as disruptions in car production social tensions and fiscal policy uncertainty as a result gross domestic product gdp growth in both the euro area and the eu likely slipped to 1 9 in 2018 down from 2 4 in 2017 autumn forecast 2 1 for eu28 and euro area economic momentum at the start of this year was subdued but the fundamentals remain sound economic growth will continue albeit more moderately the european economy is set to continue to benefit from improving labour market conditions favourable financing conditions and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance euro area gdp is now forecast to grow by 1 3 in 2019 and 1 6 in 2020 autumn forecast 1 9 in 2019 1 7 in 2020 the eu gdp growth forecast has also been revised down to 1 5 in 2019 and 1 7 in 2020 autumn forecast 1 9 in 2019 1 8 in 2020 among the larger member states downward revisions for growth in 2019 were sizeable for germany italy and the netherlands many member states continue to benefit from robust domestic demand also supported by eu funds for ireland the commission has marked down growth following a weaker than expected third quarter reducing momentum into this year influenced by the lower carry over from 2018 and the less favourable outlook for global demand ireland s gdp growth is forecast to moderate to 4 1 in 2019 and 3 7 in 2020 yes it says brexit is a big risk to the outlook but it also cites changes to the international trade and taxation situation as risk factors so the economy will still grow but not as strongly as in the recent past and with that inflation will start to fade a little too this has implications for interest rate policy with the ecb now likely to keep rates unchanged for the rest of the year so mario draghi looks like being the first ecb president to never raise interest rates in his eight year term that in turn has implications for asset prices and debt levels including for house buyers brexit is not the cause of any of this but it does feed into the negative sentiment that surrounds most economic forecasts if you wear brexit goggles you might think brexit is the only economic iceberg out there and ireland is the only country it will tear a hole in apart from the uk itself debt finally yesterday the oecd decided to shine a spotlight on that well known but rarely mentioned elephant in the room debt it finds that gross borrowings of oecd governments from the markets are set to reach a new record level in 2019 by exceeding 11trillion while government funding needs in the wake of the financial crisis increased in most oecd countries the recent further increase is confined to a few countries particularly the united states in 2017 the new debt issuance of oecd governments to the markets registered the lowest level since 2008 but increased by 600bn to 1 9trillion in 2018 and is projected to exceed 2trillion in 2019 between 2007 and 2018 outstanding central government debt for the oecd area as a whole doubled and the debt to gdp ratio rose from 49 5 to 72 6 while the new debt issuance is set to increase the nominal level of outstanding central government debt further debt to gdp ratio is projected to remain at 72 6 in 2019 mainly owing to continued economic growth in the oecd area do note that italy is the most indebted country in the eu and the euro area after the commission growth forecast this week its bond yields hit 2 95 a 280 basis point spread over german bonds it is planning to raise about 250bn from bond markets this year italy the country that france has pulled its ambassador out of and which blocked the eu s venezuela policy move on monday the same italy that got into a fight with the commission over its budget plan last october the fix in that budget plan was reliant on some optimistic growth forecasts by the commission but on thursday it downgraded italian growth from 1 2 to 0 2 the lowest by far in the eu this heralds more conflict between a populist government in rome and brussels and maybe other capitals beside paris not good for the eu or the single currency with european elections and brexit both due in the next four months brexit goggles filter out italian news and debt news have a nice day remember nothing has happened in the brexit story since last november when the eu and the uk government agreed the 585 page text of the withdrawal agreement precisely nothing sure there s been lots of huffing and puffing and displacement activity in london but what does it amount to nothing absolutely nothing but the rest of the world moves on i recommend taking off the brexit goggles for a few days each week switching off british media and looking at the other things that are happening in the world believe me you won t miss anything in the brexit story but you might be better prepared for events to come

a new federal tax incentive intended to help low income areas could put oregon taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in incentives to downtown portland developers and investors from across the nation though the opportunity zone program is national oregon will feel the tax impact thanks to the state s own tax code it automatically mirrors the federal one so oregon is effectively offering the same discount a second time on oregon tax bills and it will be felt all the stronger because gov kate brown working with business oregon picked some of the state s hottest real estate markets to be among the zones eligible for the tax incentive critics are now calling on the legislature to end oregon s part of the tax break which they say will reward investors in projects that would have happened anyway a spokeswoman for brown said she supports the idea of disconnecting from the federal tax code but she hasn t publicly pushed for it in a year when democrats are focused on passing significant tax increases to pay for k 12 education and public pension costs such a change might lack momentum state officials defended their choices of opportunity zone locations saying that offering the tax incentives in areas already popular with developers gives oregon a better chance at triggering an influx of out of state cash looking forward state leaders say they can t predict how much the opportunity zones will stimulate investment or affect state revenue questions the brown administration first raised a year ago but never answered the opportunity zone program passed by congress in the waning days of 2017 as part of president trump s tax overhaul allows an investor to sell something that has increased in value such as stock or real estate but delay paying taxes on their profits known as capital gains if they immediately reinvest in a building or business located in one of the zones when those investors sell their stake in the new investment after at least five years the taxes on their reinvested capital gains are discounted by 10 to 15 percent but if they keep the new investment for at least 10 years taxes on any capital gains reaped from the project are completely wiped away nick batz policy and government affairs director for business oregon the state economic development agency explained the benefit in an email a year ago to agency director chris harder it creates domestic tax havens if i m an investor i park my capital gains in the safest company i can find in one of these zones and wait ten years to withdraw tax free but economic development officials view oregon as competing with other states for opportunity zone dollars we ve had a growing economy business oregon spokesman nathan buehler said but we don t want to take our foot off the gas the oregonian oregonlive s review of 1 000 pages of public records revealed that oregon leaders made the decision to go all in on the opportunity zone program despite lacking answers to two key questions how much tax revenue the state stands to give up and what economic payoff the investments might yield for oregonians i suggest we start with staff from an economic development perspective and then we can follow up on the revenue impact side at a later date brown s chief of staff nik blosser wrote in a feb 3 2018 email the biggest question i have is how much investment is this likely to incite i m assuming business oregon is doing this analysis in an interview a year later buehler of business oregon said the answer is we don t know in the near term the state s tax agency estimates opportunity zones will cost oregon 10 5 million in lost revenue in the current budget and 15 9 million in the next budget cycle that s just state capital gains taxes that investors will defer on their previous gains that oregon could otherwise tax by plowing the money into the new opportunity zones in oregon or any other state a bigger hit will almost certainly come a decade from now when investors sell their stake in portland opportunity zone investments although oregon doesn t have a handle on that future impact state economist mark mcmullen said he expects opportunity zones will generate a relatively small portion of future capital gains in oregon the magnitude of the impact is not expected to be large relative to the huge size of total capital gains mcmullen wrote in an email overall capital gains are a significant chunk of the state s 20 5 billion in general fund revenue this biennium from 2017 through 2018 the state could receive roughly 1 4 billion in capital gains tax revenue given taxable gains and average tax rate information provided by the oregon office of economic analysis still the progressive tax advocacy group tax fairness oregon and others are pushing lawmakers to end oregon s part of the tax break during the legislative session underway in salem house bill 2144 introduced by the house revenue committee would uncouple oregon s tax conformity for opportunity zones the double tax break is clearly going to benefit the owners of projects that were going to happen anyway said jody wiser of tax fairness oregon there will be some projects that will happen earlier than they might otherwise have gone in but there s nothing in there that oregon s going to do to create additional public benefit some developers such as vanessa sturgeon of sturgeon development partners say the incentives are stimulating new investment daniel hauser a policy analyst and registered lobbyist with the left leaning oregon center for public policy said the organization supports efforts to end the state tax incentive keeping it would mean less money for the state s coffers and subsidizing investments that would already be happening hauser said however hauser said that killing the opportunity zone break ranks low on the policy center s priorities this session that s because it s unclear how much the double tax break would lower state revenues whereas the bipartisan momentum to raise business taxes by 1 billion a biennium or more this session would have a huge impact the state s ability to fund education and other public services sen mark hass a beaverton democrat and chairman of the senate finance and revenue committee said there are a couple proposals in the legislature for oregon to broadly stop copying federal tax code a practice intended to simplify tax returns this points to a larger issue hass said should the state be connected to federal tax policy that nobody in the state had any role in creating i think the answer is no as for why he isn t working to end the opportunity zone incentive specifically this year hass said the lack of information makes it unclear what lawmakers should do i don t have any intel on the extent they re being used and whether they re detrimental or good he said business groups haven t come and said they love it consumer groups haven t come and said they hate it the program could in fact prove a timely shot in the arm for a regional construction market in a slump new development proposals have slowed thanks to the rising costs of construction materials and labor paired with flattening rents i think we re actually going to see some projects come out of the ground now that would not have before said sturgeon whose sturgeon development partners has proposed building in opportunity zones in portland and salem i can tell already that money that was just sitting on the books is now going to be used out in the market and invested in projects that are going to create jobs opportunity zone projects would have benefits to oregon that would offset the loss of state taxes on capital gains said buehler the business oregon spokesman the investments bring an infusion of cash into the economy generating income taxes on resulting jobs new construction results in more property tax revenue for cities and schools sturgeon whose other company tmt development most recently completed the downtown park avenue west tower is recruiting opportunity zone investors for a 285 million mixed use tower on one of three sites in central portland as well as the renovation of a 43 million downtown salem hotel sturgeon said the materials sent to prospective investors don t factor in the matching state tax incentives nonetheless she said it s always disappointing when oregon decides to break from the federal government in a tax matter opportunity zones are scattered throughout nearly every county in the state and throughout the country but portland in particular is poised to see an outsized influx of out of state investment the city s zones are an outlier nationally because they re such hot construction zones already they include downtown portland the pearl district the south waterfront and much of the lloyd district real capital analytics a new york company that analyzed opportunity zones for prospective investors found portland opportunity zones saw more than 40 percent of the city s commercial development by dollar volume over the last four years even though they contain just 13 percent of the city s land area and 9 percent of its population the opportunity zone program could further concentrate development in those areas said jim costello a senior vice president for the company and investors will like that there s little ambiguity in portland s downtown core over which sites are in opportunity zones and which aren t the pain of traveling around the state and finding deals is negated when it s very concentrated in the city s core costello said another report from the national developers coalition locus found that portland s opportunity zones stood out as some of the most appealing for investors given their already strong market demand but portland s opportunity zones also rank high among areas with access to mass transit a supply of affordable housing and vulnerable populations such as minority low income or disabled residents if communities don t act to protect those assets locus director christopher coes said redevelopment in opportunity zones could kick displacement into overdrive our hope is to make sure they have do no harm policies in place coes said that could include policies that encourage the construction of housing over other uses as well as affordable housing mandates and tenant protections he said portland has in place a zoning policy that requires developers to include affordable units in large housing developments as well as a suite of new tenant protections passed as rents climbed in recent years some developers however have pointed to these policies as a contributing factor in the construction slowdown city economic development officials are watching with some apprehension to see what the flow of opportunity zone capital could bring i don t really believe this is structured as an economic development program said justin douglas a policy manager at prosper portland the city s economic development agency it s structured as a way for individuals to shield capital gains taxes and it just happens to be through investments and businesses in low income communities portland took no position on the state s opportunity zone selections though one neighborhood cully which has seen some of the city s fastest rising home prices in recent years opted out for fear it would advance gentrification in a letter to the governor s economic adviser jason lewis berry and a long list of state lawmakers and local officials community groups asked to be left off brown s list it s not clear what cities like portland can do to make sure the tax advantaged development meets any kind of community need nor even to monitor what kinds of development it s attracting instead they hope to harness it by joining in by using opportunity zone incentives to develop city owned sites or selling sites to developers with strict community benefit agreements in place the most control that cities have over something like this is in a case where a municipal agency like prosper portland owns real estate douglas said otherwise it s not clear how a local municipality through the current structure of the program could layer on any sort of local rules or notifications elliot njus enjus oregonian com 503 294 5034 enjus hillary borrud hborrud oregonian com 503 294 4034 hborrud visit subscription

with 3 1 billion in cash on our balance sheet cash from operations excluding the impact of working capital was 7 9 billion working capital changes reduced cash flow by 300 million we received 1 billion from the net issuance of debt during the year we funded 2 6 billion of capital expenditures and investments paid dividends of 1 4 billion and repurchased 4 7 billion of our shares representing 10 of shares outstanding our ending cash balance was 3 billion slide six summarizes our fourth quarter results adjusted earnings were 2 3 billion and adjusted earnings per share was 4 87 we generated operating cash flow of 4 1 billion including distributions from equity affiliates of 840 million capital spending for the quarter was approximately 1 billion with 648 million spent on growth projects we returned 864 million to shareholders through 367 million of dividends and 497 million of share repurchases we ended the year with 456 million shares outstanding moving to slide seven as i mentioned on last quarter s call we have changed our segment reporting to a pre tax basis income taxes are reflected at the consolidated company level this change makes our segment reporting more comparable with our peers this slide highlights the change in pre tax income by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter quarter over quarter adjusted earnings increased 804 million driven by higher results in refining marketing and midstream partially offset by lower chemicals results the fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21 slide eight shows our midstream results fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income for the segment was 409 million an increase of 97 million from the previous quarter midstream full year adjusted pre tax income was a record 1 2 billion more than 600 million higher than the prior year transportation adjusted pre tax income for the fourth quarter was 234 million up 25 million from the previous quarter the increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes for both our joint venture and wholly owned assets our operated pipelines benefited from strong utilization at our refineries in addition fourth quarter throughput on the bakken pipeline increased an average more then 500 000 barrels per day ngl and other adjusted pre tax income was 122 million an increase of 48 million primarily from inventory impacts we continue to run well at the sweeny hub during the quarter the export facility averaged 10 cargoes a month and the fractionator averaged 116 utilization dcp midstream adjusted pre tax income of 53 million in the fourth quarter is up 24 million from the previous quarter primarily due to improved hedging results partially offset by higher operating costs during the fourth quarter dcp completed the expansion of the sand hills pipeline capacity to 485 000 barrels per day sand hills is owned two thirds by dcp and one third by phillips 66 partners turning to chemicals on slide nine fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income for the segment was 152 million 111 million lower than the third quarter olefins and polyolefins adjusted pre tax income was 158 million down 67 million from the previous quarter the decrease reflects seasonally lower polyethylene sales volumes and higher turnaround in maintenance costs global o p utilization was 95 in the fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income for sa s decreased 35 million due to lower earnings for cpchem s equity affiliates and higher domestic turnaround costs the 9 million decrease in other reflects the fourth quarter increase of a contingent liability and a gain on an asset sale in the third quarter during the fourth quarter we received 300 million of cash distributions from cpchem next on slide 10 we ll cover refining crude utilization was 99 compared with 93 in the third quarter the fourth quarter clean product yield was 86 and pre tax turnaround costs were 130 million an increase of 75 million from the previous quarter the market crack declined 36 from the previous quarter realized margin was 16 53 per barrel 24 higher than the third quarter the chart on slide 10 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted pre tax income which increased 745 million primarily from strong results in the central corridor and gulf coast regions for the full year refining generated adjusted pre tax income of 4 6 billion the atlantic basin results increased as the bayway refinery returned to normal operations following third quarter downtime gulf coast adjusted pre tax income of 468 million increased 247 million due to higher clean product realizations improved heavy canadian crude oil differentials and increased volumes at the alliance refinery following third quarter downtime the higher clean product realizations benefited from declining market prices capacity utilization in the gulf coast region was 100 adjusted pre tax income in the central corridor was 1 2 billion an increase of 342 million reflecting expanded discounts on canadian crudes capacity utilization in the central corridor was 106 in the west coast the increase was mainly due to higher realized margins driven by widening crude differentials partially offset by higher turnaround costs slide 11 covers market capture the 3 2 1 market crack for the fourth quarter was 9 11 per barrel compared to 14 21 per barrel in the third quarter the realized margin was 16 53 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 181 market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries we make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3 2 1 market crack the gasoline crack spread declined by 8 75 per barrel during the quarter while the distillate crack improved by 2 20 per barrel losses from secondary products of 0 29 per barrel were improved a 1 33 per barrel from the previous quarter due to the decline in crude oil prices relative to ngl fuel oil and coke advantaged feedstocks improved realized margins by 3 79 per barrel an improvement of a 1 29 per barrel from the prior quarter primarily due to widening canadian crude differentials the other category improved realized margins by 3 57 per barrel primarily due to optimization across our logistics network to capture market opportunities associated with widening crude differentials realized margins were further improved by gulf coast clean product price realizations moving to marketing and specialties on slide 12 adjusted fourth quarter pre tax income was a record 592 million 207 million higher than the third quarter marketing and other increased 205 million from improved margins associated with sharply following spot prices refined product exports in the fourth quarter were a record 249 000 barrels per day we reimaged 466 domestic branded sites during the fourth quarter bringing the total to approximately 2 600 since the start of our program for 2019 an additional 1 800 sites are scheduled for reimaging specialties adjusted pre tax income increased 2 million during the quarter primarily due to higher lubricants margins on slide 13 the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre tax costs of 201 million improved 22 million from the prior quarter lower net interest expense was due to interest income on a higher average cash balance and increased capitalized interest the corporate overhead cost decrease was due to employee severance costs recognized in the third quarter this concludes my review of the financial and operating results next i ll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year in chemicals we expect the first quarter global o p utilization rate to be in the mid 90s in refining we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid 80s and pre tax turnaround expenses to be between 140 million and 170 million we anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between 210 million and 240 million pre tax for 2019 we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between 550 million and 600 million pre tax we expect corporate and other costs to be in the range of 850 million to 900 million pre tax for the year we anticipate full year of d a of about 1 4 billion and finally we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low 20s with that we ll now open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session as we open the call for questions as a courtesy to all participants please limit yourselves to one question and one follow up question operator instructions phil gresh from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open phil gresh jpmorgan analyst hi and congratulations on a solid quarter here greg i guess the first question here would be if you look back at 2018 i mean this is the third straight quarter where you ve handled you ve beaten the consensus expectations it seems to be driven by different parts of the portfolio obviously refining has been strong but even other parts of the portfolio have been very strong as well so how do you think about the performance this year do you see some kind of sustainable structural improvement going on at phillips that s underappreciated or is this just beat or keeping control of the sell side better greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer you guys are doing a great job phil so look i think that there is no question the market environment we find ourselves is playing to the strength of our portfolio and it s two things it s distillate right and differentials and so no question in the fourth quarter the wcs differential drove a lot of the value creation we improved our distillate yield we re up another 1 in the fourth quarter so 90 39 distillate yield so versus our peers who were at the high end of the range on distillate and given our coking capacity and our ability to run heavy is differential the other thing i would just say is we got the these chemicals assets are up they re running they re performing well that s going to continue to drive earnings improvement versus mid cycle for us then you think about our midstream business starting to kick in we actually made more in midstream than we made in chemicals in 2018 so across the portfolio the things we ve been investing in are starting to show up and deliver value and then finally we continue to run really well operational excellence is key for us we continue to emphasize that in the quarter where we needed to run well i mean we run ran 106 utilization and central corridor ran a 100 on the gulf coast and it showed up as value so i don t know jeff if you have any comments on other structural changes jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think the projects that greg is talking about 1 5 billion of ebitda and incremental projects added across kind of evenly distributed between chemicals midstream and refining that s improved our overall cash flow from operations in a normalizing environment greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would probably say given kind of normalized mid cycle we used to say 4 billion to 5 billion we re kind of 6 billion to 7 billion now of cash flow on a normalized basis phil gresh jpmorgan analyst got it ok thanks i guess second question just looking at the guidance for the first quarter the mid 80s utilization in refining and the turnaround costs there would you say that the entire impact on utilization is the turnarounds or are you seeing an environment here for yourselves or for the industry that is warranting some run cuts here in the first quarter greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer most of that guidance is centered around turnaround activity we ve pulled a few things maybe from the back half of the year into the front half of the year where we could making sure that we can run in the back half but that s around the margin phil there wasn t a lot of work there so it s mostly focused around our turnaround activity phil gresh jpmorgan analyst got it ok one last one just for kevin how do you feel about the balance sheet levels here obviously earlier in the year you issued some debt to buyback some shares finishing the year really strong on cash flow clearly so how do you feel about desires to pay down debt from here kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah phil so we feel pretty good about where we got to in fact we basically we replenished the cash from where we had been with the strong third and fourth quarter this year so 3 billion of cash debt to cap is 29 on a fully consolidated basis 23 net of cash so we feel good on that we have some debt that s available for paydown but we ll look at that in the overall context of how the start of the year shakes out we ll have a little bit of turnaround on working capital that s typically a use of cash in the first quarter and so we d expect to see that happen as it typically does but the nice thing is we have a lot of flexibility to work through so if we have weak margins for any kind of extended period we have the flexibility to continue to work through that and fund all of our obligations phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay thanks i ll turn it over greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer thanks phil operator doug terreson with evercore isi please go ahead your line is open doug terreson evercore isi analyst good morning everybody greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey doug kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning doug terreson evercore isi analyst guys your 17 return on capital employed and your 10 reduction in shares outstanding are the best in the us energy industry so kudos to the team on exceptional results that s really good work there and my yeah my question is on your outlook for key businesses and starting with refining with margins on variable costs for conversion capacity unusually low do you think that utilization is going to decline for some of these processes there because weakness is often seasonal this time of the year throughput is going to remain high but so the question is how are you guys thinking about managing conversion utilization given these circumstances and also how do you think it plays out across the industry greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so i ll take a stab and jeff can correct me how about that so look i think that everyone s concerned about the high gasoline inventories at this point in the cycle there s no question in the fourth quarter the market environment was encouraging you to run given the diesel cracks that we had and gasoline cracks weren t that great but we re heading into the spring turnaround season there are some operational issues out there so our assessment is we re probably a little above normal in terms of outages for this time of year then you get to the propane butane in gasoline it comes out of the gasoline pool that s all directionally helpful for gasoline we re still constructive overall demand we think gasoline demand in north america is going to be flat for 2019 we see distillate demand up 1 2 1 3 in that range and a new add on imo and i know there s a debate about imo and that but there s still going to be some level of tailwind so as we look at 2019 for the year we re still mid cycle or better in terms of refining cracks doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst okay thanks greg jeff did you want to say anything or did he cover it jeff dietert vice president investor relations i think he covered it well doug terreson evercore isi analyst okay i didn t mean to interrupt anyway on chemicals you guys jeff dietert vice president investor relations go ahead doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst well i was just going to ask a question about chemicals and specifically you guys have strength capacity in the last couple of years and you seem positioned for more spending in the area based on greg s comments today so just want to get an update on your constructive view on chemicals which is a little bit more constructive than some and so the basis for increased investment in that area why are you guys optimistic for chemicals greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah so first of all you think about a growing global economy and albeit 19 is probably going to be a lower growth year than what 18 is globally but we re still constructive demand strictly for polyethylene which is mostly what cpchem makes in our view is demand is going to grow faster than capacity in 2019 so it should be constructive for operating rates and margins 2019 and then you look at all the advantaged feedstocks they re still available in the us doug and so that really says you should build into that if you have a great position which cpchem does access to advantaged feedstocks great technology great return on business and so it s a business that we should want to invest into jeff dietert vice president investor relations polyethylene grew by 6 last year substantially above gdp growth we did have some weakness in the fourth quarter we experienced the typical seasonal softness in demand but it was compounded by 35 decline in crude prices as we started the year margins were soft but crude prices have rebounded and cpchem seeing signs of demand improvement healthy demand is expected to drive some polyethylene price increases in the first quarter operator neil mehta from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open neil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning team and i ll add my congratulations on a good quarter here greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer thanks neil neil mehta goldman sachs analyst the kickoff question from me is on western canadian crude differentials which obviously were big tailwind in 4q and have reversed here in 1q our view is that it ultimately will settle out toward transportation economics which is wider than here but just your latest thoughts on how this plays out in 2019 and then longer term is there still a lot of uncertainty around the pipe and how you re adjusting your business to take advantage of that jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we ve gone from an unsustainably wide discount for canadian heavy to an unsustainably narrow discount we believe with the mandated cuts there was substantially more volume that came off the market than what the 325 million targeted amount was we also had some economic run reductions production reductions and so we are running well below what the producing capacity is in canada we do expect similar to your comments to move to rail economics as this passes i think a number of the canadian producers have argued for moving away from the mandate and so we expect the differentials to go back to kind of rail economics wti minus 20 something in that area neil mehta goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and then the follow up is something a little bit more specific slide 11 of your deck on refining margins kevin you walked through configuration of feedstock that made a lot of sense the other number felt bigger than normal 3 57 but it was a big part of the strength in the realized market can you talk about what that is in a little bit more detail and how should we think about that is that just a function of crude prices coming down precipitously or can we carry any of that forward kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so you re partly on to that neil it does cover there are a variety of things in that other category but the big drivers for why that s a positive of 3 plus per barrel this time is a function of one realizing stronger prices on product realizations a lot of which is a function of the declining the overall declining market helped on the product price realizations and then the other is just on the crude side the crude differential side being able to optimize how we are moving barrels around our network to capture opportunities as they are available which in that kind of market environment we saw in the fourth quarter so it lent itself to us being able to do that so you think about both of those and not really it was good to have in the fourth quarter good that we could capture it but not something you d assume as ratable operator blake fernandes with piper jaffray please go ahead your line is open blake fernandez piper jaffray analyst guys good morning and congrats as well on the strong print there i know you covered chemicals already but in the release you talked a little bit about some potential debottlenecking and i was hoping you could maybe elaborate a little bit on that i m assuming that s totally separate from a potential second crack or just trying to get a sense of how significant that could be and maybe timing around that kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah blake it s kevin in terms of the debottleneck opportunities those are not of anything like the scale of the next major expansion major project i e a second cracker project these are what i would consider to be in a portfolio like cpchem has we re always able to identify opportunities for incremental investment to drive incremental production and usually very strong returns on those investments so i don t think we look at any one of those as significantly large but they typically screen pretty high to the list of priorities for investment because by nature of them being incremental to the existing portfolio usually very attractive returns greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so gulf coast project was by 33 capacity increase i mean debottleneck is typically on the order of 5 maybe 10 blake and but it s not across all the products we have very specific places where we think we can get some more capacity out of the derivatives and actually some of the ethylene units too but they re certainly worth pursuing when you look at the returns blake fernandez piper jaffray analyst yeah got it the second one really is just on i guess is focused on moving toward light sweet given the compression and heavy differentials in the market so maybe if you could just give an update on where you are on your system as far as ability to flex back and forth between light sweet and then i guess while we re on it maybe the same with the distillate and gasoline if you re at max distillate mode at this point jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we have shifted given the economics in the marketplace they have really driven a move toward maxing diesel and so we are there we ve been there and so we are making about as much diesel as we can given the current economics similar on the light product side we re about 50 sweet and 50 sour that s about a 1 million barrels a day or so of sweet crude there s the potential to go maybe another 100 000 barrels a day it s obviously dependent on economics we d need the economic incentive to do that but that s what our upside potential is there operator roger read with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open roger read wells fargo analyst yeah thanks good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good morning jeff dietert vice president investor relations hi roger roger read wells fargo analyst i guess maybe we could talk a little bit about the midstream segment and obviously you ve highlighted gray oak and so forth but as i think about the performance in the quarter looking in the 19 and 20 in an e p industry that seems to be slowing at spending a little bit and maybe slowing production how does that environment compare to the baseline that you ve laid out in terms of your expectation for future pipeline investments and i guess ngl fractionation et cetera as you think about what may get the trigger pulled on it in 19 or 20 and i guess really at the heart of it i m trying to understand what maybe the growth prospects are for the at least tee transportation and ngl side of the midstream as we look over the next year or two greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so i would start with we re just not going to build speculative capacity roger i think that the midstream projects we have in the queue are subscribed with p d and long term contracts these are seven year and 10 year contracts with good counterparties on the other side so i think that s a starting point i think you re right to the extent that they drove results down north america some of these additional investments will slow down so to the extent we can get these things subscribed we re not going to build them that is probably the starting point on that gray oak fully subscribed factory three fully subscribed but it s interesting we re still seeing good interest in additional frac capacity we re out in open seasons in red oak and liberty and i d say interest level is good on those we ll see well i don t know exactly where we will end up yet when people want to sign we just completed successful open season on dapple going to 570 million but we re still seeing good interest level out there from the producers and investing and having infrastructure to clear from the production centers to the market centers jeff do you want to comment jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah there s still substantial resource available and with new infrastructure coming the potential that activity resumes we re looking at ngl production growth that s been around 500 000 barrels a day year on year we re not adding that type of capacity in 2019 and so as production continues to grow the need for infrastructure will continue the challenge is matching the timing with production growth and infrastructure growth and so that s what getting projects fully contracted attempts to do roger read wells fargo analyst okay great thanks and then shifting gears back to refining greg you mentioned kind of a mid cycle or better assumption on margins for refining in 19 seems that on a macro front we get more concerns raised by investors that globally new capacity coming on line will be faster than demand growth not asking you to forecast demand growth that s too tough for any of us but as you think about the new capacity coming online how much of that do you think is really aimed at the transportation market versus what is nominally aimed at the petrochemical side in terms of feedstock greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we have a couple in china one in the middle east coming on in 2019 the transparency into china is probably a little harder for us our view is those two refineries are probably more petrochemical feedstock oriented and less gasoline oriented so and we think that they re probably toward the back half of 2019 so yeah there s capacity that s going to come on this year but i m not sure it s going to be as big a impact strictly to the first half of the year is what some people think jeff you want to comment jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think on the chinese side it s petrochemical focused as greg mentioned but with low diesel yields as well operator paul sankey from mizuho please go ahead your line is open paul sankey mizuho analyst good afternoon everyone greg you made some interesting comments recently to us about china demand keeping on with the general demand picture your sales i think has held up pretty well could you extend on what you were saying about the global markets petrochemicals you also as you may know had excellent saying that this weakness is because of excess capacity which i think you ve really referred to early on in this call but or rather i should say new capacity could you just talk a little bit about how the market could be clearing and particularly the market is still concerned about china anything you could add on that would be interesting thanks greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah absolutely thanks paul well first of all we re still constructive petrochemical demand coming into 2019 still driven by hundreds of millions if not billions of people ultimately coming into the middle class over the next decade or so so i think the fundamentals are set up well there china i mean it s interesting when you see crude prices fall as drastically as they did in the fourth quarter they always slow down because they know that petrochemical prices are going to fall those down and they ll wait time in the bottom and start buying again so we did probably see some slowdown activity in the fourth quarter around china but as we look into china through into the base demand in china it s still pretty healthy i d say north american demand european demand still relatively healthy in terms of growth and so i think that s been the surprise to the upside in the chemicals environment so still constructive i think what i d say is our fundamental view on 2019 for chemicals is that demand on chemicals is going to grow faster than capacity additions and the other thing is we may see some slippage on these other projects that are slated to come up in 2019 paul sankey mizuho analyst great thank you and then the follow up is a pretty large strategy question but it s related to your cash return versus capex framework which is 60 40 as we know at the moment i was wondering over what time frame and for what reasons that my shift given the scale of the company for example is getting so large thanks greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah so if you think about 12 to 18 we and consider our investments in equity affiliates we re right on top of the 60 40 60 reinvested back into our company and 40 back to shareholders who secure growing competitive dividend and share repurchase and exchanges in 2018 we were 60 40 it was just the other way we were 60 distributions and 40 investment back into our business but paul as i think kind of over a three year horizon the mid term most of our projects that we re investing in in midstream or refining we kind of have two year horizons on them the chemicals projects tend to go into a three to four year horizon on them but if i want to think about a three year horizon i still think 60 40 is about the right place for us to be operator paul cheng from barclays please go ahead your line is open paul cheng barclays analyst hey guys good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good morning paul jeff dietert vice president investor relations hey paul paul cheng barclays analyst couple quick questions greg you talked about china can you talk about mexico that where do you see on the export market there that with i mean we have heard early in the year that some widespread fuel shortage that s in the initial or formed an impact your export volume and have you seen any change in the trend that s the first question the second question is on the crude differential exxon has said that in the fourth quarter versus the year before fourth quarter their crude differential inaudible is about 1 2 billion after tax and now when you look at the chart look like it is about 1 6 billion i m wondering that is there a number that you can share jeff dietert vice president investor relations i ll take the mexico question we are seeing some impact on exports to mexico as their demand has gone down with the pipeline shutdowns mexico demand is about 800 000 barrels a day gasoline is about 350 000 barrels a day of diesel they import about 75 of that from the us at least in 2018 as you know refining utilization averaged about 38 last year and we re expecting it to go down lower from that this year we have seen some impact on exports into mexico and those volumes are down we re seeing some signs of movement into some of the interior but some of that demand is going to be lost permanently and as they re able to get product back into the center or country that will resume their imports but we are seeing that down somewhat paul cheng barclays analyst jeff have you seen any sign the export to mexico start to recover or increasing jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we have seen a little bit of a relief recently but it s probably going to be an area we don t have a lot of transparency in as they try to recover from these pipeline outages paul cheng barclays analyst thank you and how about the crude differential greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey paul yeah on your first question when you look at the wcs ti kind of year over year 17 versus 18 it s about 13 and a 1 is about 100 million so on an ebitda basis it s 1 3 billion for us paul paul cheng barclays analyst perfect thank you jeff dietert vice president investor relations thank you operator doug leggate from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead your line is open clay bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys this is clay on for doug thanks for taking the question greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey clay bank of america merrill lynch analyst so my first is on it s a follow up to phil s question about the use of cash just wondering with your balances reloaded does this affirm the high end of your 1 billion to 2 billion buyback target for 2019 greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think we will guide to the range of 1 billion to 2 billion clay bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right my second question is a follow up to neil s question just on the wcf differential the alberta cuts cuts have worked but perhaps they ve worked too well since the dip is now out of the money as it relates to rail so my question is do you see a sharp slowdown in rail and do think that this could be a catalyst for a sharp widening of the dips may be not too october levels but toward that direction jeff dietert vice president investor relations yes we are seeing a reduced utilization of rail as we come into february i believe some of the canadian producers that ship by rail have acknowledged reduction those economics are closed the arm is closed and the marketplace is starting to react greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think it s interesting it looks like to us that we ve pulled inventories which was the whole idea of the government intervention and we ve over shopped on the differential and it looks like to us inventories are starting to build again in canada so i think that we will get back to the point where we have a differential at least a clear by rail and so you think about a fully loaded rail cost kind of 18 to 20 ish a barrel you look at variable cost is probably 15 to 16 so i think we ll get to the variable cost and then we ll move to variable cost as the year goes on operator prashant rao with citigroup please go ahead your line is open prashant rao citigroup analyst thanks good morning and thanks for taking the question my first sort of straddle midstream and refining a bit thinking about storage capacity and needs particularly in the gulf coast and through logistics needs and opportunities over the next couple of years i sort of see at least two event windows here one being imo and i m thinking about longer hydrocarbon chains here in particular medium to longer hydrocarbon chains one is imo we were expecting storage needs for fuel oil storage needs for different sorts of distillates changes in crude trade lanes and dynamics and the second being the wave of barrels that we expect to hit the gulf coast out for export as we get toward 2020 2021 i m curious to know sort of your thoughts on how the existing infrastructure wherever it stands in terms of capacity to handle the demand it will be there along these various lanes and sort of where s the opportunity for phillips since you re invested in projects that are all through the value chain and i figured you might have a view into sort of where the best sort of incremental opportunities are and how these play off against each other jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah so we do expect the growing production to largely be exported as the pipelines are announced most of the major pipelines have associated export terminals tied with them similar to our gray oak and south texas gateway terminal we ve got export capacity out of beaumont and we re continuing to build out that facility we ve got lpg export capability out of sweeny and as more and more fractionation comes online a lot of that lpg is going to be need to be exported and so we do see those opportunities across many of our value chains operator manav gupta with credit suisse please go ahead your line is open manav gupta credit suisse analyst hey guys can you talk about the benefits of bayou bridge on your entire gulf coast refining system and the actual start up date jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah so bayou bridge we have expectations for it to start up in march and provide service into st james bayou bridge also provides service from beaumont into lake charles and our lake charles refinery at lake charles we ve had projects there to increase our ability to use discounted domestic crudes and so we re benefiting there from the bayou bridge access to crudes and then the bayou bridge lake charles the st james provides opportunity for east pipeline which is in open season and that open season is continuing with strong interest and hopefully we ll have more to report on that in the near future manav gupta credit suisse analyst and a quick follow up jeff two areas where you first feel a recession coming is polyethylene demand and distillate demand demand softness is one thing but you re very close to both those end markets is there any sign in any of those two markets that we are probably approaching recession jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think greg covered the polyethylene side of the equation and perhaps more information there but when we look at diesel demand is very strong tonnage up 8 year on year most recent information global airline revenue miles up 6 year on year we re continuing to see strong diesel demand in the markets in which we participate so we don t see any signs as of this point operator chris sighinolfi with jefferies please go ahead your line is open chris sighinolfi jefferies analyst hi greg greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey chris sighinolfi jefferies analyst thanks for taking my questions i have two and they both relate to marketing and specialties i guess first very strong results here in the fourth quarter and if i look at how things performed versus our expectations and history it appears international fuel margins were particularly bright spot so i m wondering with a near double it s almost a doubling of the foreign margin quarter on quarter i believe it s the second consecutive record for you on fuel margins there just wanted to check kind of about any particular drivers of that and if anything structural is it for it that you ve cautioned us to pay attention to greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i d maybe start with in europe our markets are focused around germany austria switzerland and the uk in germany we had low water levels at the rhine and that presented some logistical challenges and we were able to use our infrastructure and logistic systems to capture some of the opportunity in advantaged as you know we re kind of reimaging rebuilding about 30 new jet sites a year in europe and so we re seeing some increased uplift from that so that s a piece it s i don t know if it s structural or not but it s certainly an adder and then we re moving into uk doing some similar work in the uk around the jet brand in the uk so combination of a logistical opportunity created in the fourth quarter and just some good nice growth opportunities jeff dietert vice president investor relations and i would just add on that the overall environment the falling price environment had the benefit you would expect to see in those markets as well like we saw in the us chris sighinolfi jefferies analyst right all right okay thanks and i guess secondly you ve continued to execute that reimaging effort on the branded sites here you noted in the release i think roughly 2 same store sales growth figure for the reimaged sites last year and i m just curious how that would compare to sites that have yet to be reimaged greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think the 2 is a really good number and it s what we see inside outside in terms of the uplift i mean the sites are certainly more attractive it s drawing people in and they re spending money and that s a whole reason we re doing the campaign operator jason gabelman from cowen and company please go ahead your line is open jason gabelman cowen and company analyst yeah i was going to ask about the international margin so thanks for addressing that i guess my other question is just going back to refining margins wondering with oil prices falling as they did just in terms of the secondary product realizations which geography do you see the highest uplift from those secondary products jeff dietert vice president investor relations we do see uplift across all our regions as you know we have cokers at all our refineries except for ferndale and bayway and so there is some contribution meaningful contribution from all of the different regions we saw it benefit coke ngls and fuel oil during the quarter so it was really across all the products and there was meaningful contributions from each of the regions jason gabelman cowen and company analyst okay so you wouldn t say just in a more general way that one region tends to benefit more than others it sounds like jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s across the board jason gabelman cowen and company analyst all right and then just a quick follow up it looks like capex ran a little high and 4q obviously not a big concern given the cash flow you generated in the quarter but i was just wondering what that was from and if that resulting in maybe capex coming in a bit lower next year kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer this is kevin you just look at the two large projects that we sanctioned last year and the timing of when the spend really started to ramp up on those so that was gray oak and the expansion of the sweeny hub with the additional fractionation capacity and so you re just seeing the impact of the spend level ramping up on those projects and that s already factored into our capital budget for 2019 that we communicated back in december operator matthew blair from tudor pickering holt please go ahead your line is open matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning everyone it seems like your gulf coast refining system really outperformed peers you think that was the result of bringing down the wcs barrels or was there anything unusual or anything that stood out this quarter jeff dietert vice president investor relations i think as we optimize across the integrated logistics network we did are able to allocate the canadian heavy volumes to the area that are most beneficial we did consume a fair amount of canadian heavy in the gulf coast we also benefit from the wide bakken differential with the bakken pipeline feeding into the gulf coast and across bayou bridge into lake charles so those were big contributions configuration is a meaningful impact on gulf coast because we produce less gasoline and more diesel than is in the 3 2 1 product realizations from pricing lags in a declining oil price environment were positive and i think finally the alliance refinery was down for maintenance during part of the third quarter and ran during the fourth quarter so we had higher volumes and lower turnaround expense there kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer 100 utilization for the region for the quarter always helps to matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst sounds good and what kind of impact if any are you expecting from this recent keystone pipeline outage jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a little bit early to know what the impact is going to be we are a shipper on the pipe so there is the potential for some impact but we will have to wait and see what the details of that situation are greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer we got to work around we actually talked about that this morning i guess platte is down too so we re i think we re prepared but again as jeff said i think we need to see more details about how long the pipe is going to be down operator we have now reached the time limit available for questions i would now turn the call back over to jeff jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah thank you julie and thank all of you for your interest in phillips 66 if you have additional questions please call brent or me thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference you may now disconnect duration 60 minutes call participants jeff dietert vice president investor relations greg c

with lópez obrador in workers have the confidence to walk out labour latin america february 9 2019 david bacon the election of andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo as president of mexico has raised the hopes and expectations of millions of mexican workers there could be no better evidence of this than the strike of tens of thousands of workers in matamoros a city at the eastern end of the u s mexico border across the rio grande rio bravo in mexico from brownsville texas during the past month between 30 000 and 40 000 of the 70 000 maquiladora workers in matamoros plants have walked off their jobs the maquiladoras are factories mostly foreign owned that manufacture goods destined for sale in the united states they are the product of a development policy begun by the mexican government in 1964 allowing the construction of foreign owned plants so long as their products were sold outside mexico the attraction for foreign companies has been a wage level far below that of workers just a few miles north and the lax enforcement of environmental and worker protection laws as a result along the border today more than two million workers labour in these factories workers and employers from tijuana to juarez are looking at the courageous actions of the matamoros workers says julia quiñones director of the border committee of women workers in ciudad acuña and a veteran of three decades of labour conflicts workers are thinking about following the matamoros example and of course employers are worried they ll do exactly that the strikes have their immediate origin in a promise made by lópez obrador in his speech to the mexican congress and repeated in mexico city s main plaza the zócalo as he was sworn into office on december 1 from january 1 he promised the minimum wage will be doubled keeping his word on january 1 he raised that wage from 88 36 pesos 4 63 per day to 176 72 pesos 9 25 matamoros in matamoros however factory owners declared that the wages of their workers would not increase because they were already making what lópez obrador had ordered according to juan villafuerte morales general secretary of the union for workers in the maquiladora industry the workers were earning between 156 and 177 pesos per day villafuerte s union is affiliated with the confederation of mexican workers ctm which during the past 25 years of the north american free trade agreement nafta has been a labour partner of the pro corporate mexican governments that preceded lópez obrador s on the border especially it has acted as a labour enforcer for the government policy of using low wages to attract foreign investment in maquiladoras quiñones however says the employers were really playing tricks with the way they calculate wages the base wage in most maquiladoras is 90 to 100 pesos but workers also earn a number of bonuses for productivity attendance transportation and other reasons they depend completely on these bonuses when the workers said their base wage should be doubled as the government promised the companies said they d eliminate the bonuses and the result would be the same as not raising the wages at all villafuerte said the union s agreement with matamoros companies permitted them to cancel bonuses if they faced an economic emergency many older matamoros workers remember a pre nafta era when their wages were much higher and the ctm union was run by a different kind of leader agapito gonzález cavazos from the late 1950s to the late 1980s the period in which the maquiladora industry mushroomed the matamoros maquiladora union had 50 000 to 60 000 members in the 1970s when the national minimum wage was 140 pesos then worth 11 20 in matamoros it was 198 pesos 15 84 in 1983 gonzález negotiated a famous agreement with a 43 per cent salary increase and an arrangement in which workers were paid for 56 hours of labour but only worked a 40 hour week gonzález also opposed the neoliberal reforms of president carlos salinas de gortari which included privatizing national enterprises ending land reform and preparing the ground for nafta matamoros s largest employers considered him an obstacle to passing and implementing the treaty in february 1992 as nafta s terms were being finalized salinas had him arrested and taken to mexico city gonzález had been negotiating union contracts with 42 companies including general motors and his arrest was protested by the united auto workers and the afl cio in the united states in the nafta era that followed labour opposition was weakened and wages fell drastically in 1992 workers were demanding 19 50 per day the new minimum wage even after being doubled by lópez obrador is 9 27 the workweek has gone back up from 40 hours to 48 hours in most factories making matters worse while matamoros s maquiladora wages aren t the lowest in mexico the cost of living on the border is much higher than in the rest of the country the price of many basic necessities like milk is actually higher in supermarkets in mexican border cities like matamoros and tijuana than it is just across the line in brownsville and san diego a woman on the assembly line in tijuana has to labour for half a day to earn enough to buy a gallon of milk prices have been rising rapidly in matamoros according to the tamaulipas office of mexico s federal consumer affairs prosecutor a pound of serrano chiles now costs 55 pesos more than half a day s wage at 88 pesos the price of tomatoes has gone up by 20 per cent and onions by 26 per cent delfina martínez a worker at trico componentes which makes auto parts for autozone and other u s retailers told reporter julia le duc of the mexico city daily la jornada that she was overjoyed when she heard about lópez obrador s promised wage increase then the union delegate told us that it was only for those who were earning minimum wage and we didn t qualify instead she discovered in her paycheck that the company had raised her wages by just 5 pesos a day then she found out it wasn t going to pay the 3 000 peso annual bonus either instead of helping her the federal decree raising the minimum wage gave a pretext to the factory to not pay us what we d normally get every january we went to the union and on saturday we put up the red and black strike flags wildcat walkouts and official strikes matamoros workers began making demands directly on the factory owners in early january and organized wildcat walkouts to pressure them into raising wages like martínez workers were additionally enraged when the companies refused to increase the aguinaldo an additional month s wages companies are obligated by law to pay workers at the end of the year soon work stopped in many plants including polytech 1 polytech 2 dura 4 afx autoliv and cedras de méxico a large percentage of the striking workers came from factories producing auto parts for u s assembly plants afx for instance is a supplier to general motors according to the matamoros maquiladora association companies lost 100 million in the first ten days thousands of workers marched through the streets of matamoros on january 18 the workers 2 000 strong occupied the offices of their own union which villafuerte had closed fearing the strikes and demonstrations angry workers accused him of caving to company demands especially in a new contract being negotiated for 2019 one of their chants which rhymes in spanish was the people are tired of so many damned tricks workers organized their own independent network called the workers movement of matamoros villafuerte was forced to announce that the union would mount an official strike the workers basic demand was a 20 per cent increase in pay and an increase in the productivity bonus from 3 500 pesos yearly to 32 000 pesos some factories offered a 10 per cent wage increase and a 10 000 peso bonus but workers rejected it on january 24 they began walking out at the 45 factories covered by the union agreement according to la jornada s le duc in some factories it was a violent process because the managers ordered the security guards to block the doors to prevent workers from leaving the production lines workers also tried to blockade the doors into some plants themselves suspecting that managers might try to sneak out machinery to continue production elsewhere rolando gonzalez barron a leader of the employers association called the workers ignorant and threatened to fire them if they participated in strike actions nevertheless on january 24 the very first day that workers walked out four factories agreed to the workers demands over the past week more than 20 more have given in thereby getting their workers to return to the assembly lines far reaching consequences the anger directed by workers at the ctm may have far reaching consequences last year before lópez obrador took office the previous government was forced to ratify convention 98 of the international labour organization guaranteeing freedom of association the mexican congress then passed a constitutional reform embodying these changes including the right of workers to vote on contracts elect their own leaders and form unions of their choice practices that the government and its cooperating unions did not previously recognize sweetheart agreements called protection contracts because they protect the employer from any effort by workers to form independent unions and raise wages will no longer be legal in matamoros one result of the strikes and organizing may be a decision by workers to use the labour law reforms and leave the ctm other national independent unions may also challenge the ctm the miners union has been active in organizing on the border and has supported the matamoros workers although it has no union contracts in the city while the lópez obrador administration has promised that the legal mechanisms protecting the old protection unions will be dismantled it has been slow to support the movement in the streets of matamoros in a november interview alfredo domínguez marrufo deputy to the new labour secretary luisa maría alcalde said that this government will defend the freedom of workers to organize and that we re not just fighting for an economic goal not just for decent wages but for the revitalization of the democratic life of workers nevertheless domínguez held a press conference in matamoros on january 25 and asked workers to postpone their strike for ten days while negotiations took place i expected more quiñones said it was a very cold response i think alcalde should have come to matamoros herself the lukewarm response didn t earn the government any breaks from employers either maquiladora owners are angry with lópez obrador for having raised workers expectations andrés manuel lópez obrador is burying the export industry in this country said luis aguirre lang president of the national maquiladora and export industry council which has been a successful model for business and regional development for 53 years it s sending the world a very wrong message of distrust about mexico that it s no longer a safe and attractive place for investment some maquiladora owners are threatening to close their factories or move them to another city the employer association for the auto parts industry declared that what the workers want is impossible instead of coming to terms with them recalcitrant employers blamed the conflict on susana prieto terrazas an attorney from juarez helping the strikers calling her an outside agitator when the strikes started the state labour board said that it had no jurisdiction over the matamoros conflict because it fell under federal purview instead but on january 29 it declared the strike non existent in 16 factories such a declaration allows a struck company to bring in strikebreakers and fire striking workers however another feature of the new government s labour law reform is the replacement of the labour boards which have historically defended employers with a neutral system of labour tribunals the actions of the labour board in matamoros provide strong evidence supporting the need for this change following the labour board s announcement tridonex fired 600 workers with the support of the ctm in protest of the firings a former union leader leocadio mendoza reyes began a hunger strike in the city s downtown plaza these people were fired because they asked for wage increases and the head of the union who s my brother turned his back on them he told la jornada despite the firings and repression workers have succeeded in winning significant wage increases in a number of factories of the original 47 that workers struck companies agreed to the workers demands in all but 11 and strikers returned to work following those agreements the strike has spread to three other plants toyoda gosei fisher dinamic and robert shown where workers rejected an 8 per cent raise negotiated by another ctm union nearly 1 000 other workers at the non maquiladora facilities of coca cola and matamoros s main milk distributor leche vaquita also walked off their jobs demanding the same 20 per cent raise and an end to unpaid overtime quiñones says that the situation of workers everywhere on the border is changing rapidly in part because of their rising expectations they re tired of abuse and exploitation and if they can see some hope for change they will act what we re seeing in matamoros is that rank and file workers are becoming more conscious and aware and that makes me optimistic this article first

the green new deal may be the dumbest piece of legislation ever submitted conservatives rightly attacked it as so much panic inducing horseshit and even nancy pelosi gave it the heisman and said no thanks thankfully it s only a nonbinding congressional resolution right now that allows all the leftist nutjobs running for president next year to virtue signal their wokeness by supporting it without actually having to vote in favor of it see how committed they are to socialist ideals now get out there all you proglodytes and vote for the democrats who put their little hairy paws on their hearts and promise to destroy your economy turn your great nation into rubble and steal all your earnings all for the common good because we all live for our brothers at least that s what the text of house resolution 109 reads like whereas the october 2018 report entitled special report on global warming of 1 5 ºc by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the november 2018 fourth national climate assessment report found that 1 human activity is the dominant cause of observed climate change over the past century 2 a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise and an increase in wildfires severe storms droughts and other extreme weather events that threaten human life healthy communities and critical infrastructure 3 global warming at or above 2 degrees celsius beyond preindustrialized levels will cause a mass migration from the regions most affected by climate change b more than 500 000 000 000 in lost annual economic output in the united states by the year 2100 c wildfires that by 2050 will annually burn at least twice as much forest area in the western united states than was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding 2019 d a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral reefs on earth e more than 350 000 000 more people to be exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 2050 and f a risk of damage to 1 000 000 000 000 of public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the united states and everybody panic or not says bjorn lomborg director of the copenhagen consensus center and a visiting professor at copenhagen business school things just aren t that bad and the changes from supposedly extreme weather will likely be gradual and hardly the humanity ending events alexandria ocasio cortez occasional cortex would have you believe the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in its latest major global analysis estimated that the total impact of unmitigated climate change from extreme weather changes in agriculture rising sea levels and so on would be equivalent to reducing the average person s income by between 0 2 and 2 percent in the 2070s by then developing world incomes will have increased by 400 percent to 500 percent or even more climate impacts have an ever smaller impact on humanity because of prosperity and resilience a hundred years ago climate disasters globally killed about half a million people annually today with many more people that toll has dropped by more than 95 percent this is from a guy who is not only a liberal but also believes in anthropogenic climate change what he doesn t believe in is tossing trillions of dollars at an alleged problem because some clueless twit of a politician foments hysteria among equally ignorant drooling uninformed dolts casting votes occasional cortex and her ilk love their pessimism everything to them is cause to panic and despair and that despair can only be solved by more government control fact is we are not in crisis we are better off as a nation and as a world than we were even 30 years ago as steven pinker said in a 2018 ted talk the other danger of thoughtless pessimism is radicalism if our institutions are all failing and beyond hope for reform a natural response is to seek to smash the machine drain the swamp burn the empire to the ground on the hope that whatever rises out of the ashes is bound to be better than what we have now that s what aoc and her ilk want to do they want to foment panic and manufacture crises so they can implement their bright ideas and exert control over your life and they are blaming the economic success of the us for all the world s troubles because like most filthy disgusting socialist swine they abhor achievement they despise anyone who earns and succeeds and they want to destroy the things they envy using via government force they loathe success and accomplishment because they cannot achieve it on their own so they use government force to tear it down the only way they can show themselves to be powerful and in control whereas because the united states has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions through 2014 and has a high technological capacity the united states must take a leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation this is a load of shit china is the world s largest polluter responsible for 25 9 percent of greehouse gas emissions the united states has already reduced said emissions by 2 7 percent during trump s first year in office and we already lead the world in carbon emissions reduction whereas the united states is currently experiencing several related crises with 1 life expectancy declining while basic needs such as clean air clean water healthy food and adequate health care housing transportation and education are inaccessible to a significant portion of the united states population 2 a 4 decade trend of wage stagnation deindustrialization and antilabor policies that has led to a hourly wages overall stagnating since the 1970s despite increased worker productivity b the third worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the developed world before the great recession c the erosion of the earning and bargaining power of workers in the united states and d inadequate resources for public sector workers to confront the challenges of climate change at local state and federal levels and crises oh is that why we ve had average real gdp growth of 3 175 in 2018 is that why unemployment is below 4 percent that s quite the economic crisis we face 3 the greatest income inequality since the 1920s with a the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of gains in the first few years of economic recovery after the great recession occasional cortex apparently slept through all her economics classes at boston university waking up for a brief moment when the professor mentioned the gini coefficient and then going back to sleep b a large racial wealth divide amounting to a difference of 20 times more wealth between the average white family and the average black family and this is where occasional cortex goes off the rails making claims based on biased research by french economist thomas piketty that have been widely panned by real economists such as chris giles economics editor for the financial times mit economist matthew rognlie uc berkeley economist alan auerbach and kevin hassett of the american enterprise institute for everything from missing citations to sketchy sources to shoddy scholarship most claims that income inequality is at a record high in the united states including piketty s are based on a measure of market income which does not take into account taxes or transfer payments or changes in household size or composition the failure to consider those factors considerably overstates effective levels of inequality in other words there is no crisis of inequality yes there are people in the us who earn more than other people they have different skills intelligence and life experiences that employers may value more than that of others inequality in and of itself is not a bad thing but occasional cortex and her jealous miserable mediocrity brethren want nothing more than for the incapable and indolent to be rewarded for their laziness and lack of skills and knowledge with the same salary as those who work their way up from rags to riches whom they despise because they succeed c a gender earnings gap that results in women earning approximately 80 percent as much as men at the median that hackneyed old claim has been discredited so many times it s almost laughable that occasional cortex still quotes it but ignorance is her weapon and spreading it is her strategy and the bumbling ignorami at whom she aims that weapon just eat it up whereas climate change pollution and environmental destruction have exacerbated systemic racial regional social environmental and economic injustices referred to in this preamble as systemic injustices by disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples communities of color migrant communities deindustrialized communities depopulated rural communities the poor low income workers women the elderly the unhoused people with disabilities and youth referred to in this preamble as frontline and vulnerable communities translation we are victims of weather give us free shit whereas climate change constitutes a direct threat to the national security of the united states 1 by impacting the economic environmental and social stability of countries and communities around the world and 2 by acting as a threat multiplier oh this is rich a socialist who cares about national security other than to ensure that the people whom the government abuses at the point of a gun and whose earnings she and her pals steal don t revolt and throw off their chains whereas the federal government led mobilizations during world war ii and the new deal created the greatest middle class that the united states has ever seen but many members of frontline and vulnerable communities were excluded from many of the economic and societal benefits of those mobilizations and no the new deal actually prolonged the great depression by seven years according to research by ucla economists harold l cole and lee e ohanian and other economic think tanks and this is where it gets really stupid because occasional cortex and friends claim that it s up to the federal government to address their histrionics how by giving away free shit of course especially to their chosen victim class you know indigenous people people of color people with vaginas people who think they should have been born with vaginas people who broke into our country illegally and those too stupid or inept to earn a living on their own 2 the goals described in subparagraphs a through e of paragraph 1 referred to in this resolution as the green new deal goals should be accomplished through a 10 year national mobilization referred to in this resolution as the green new deal mobilization that will require the following goals and projects a building resiliency against climate change related disasters such as extreme weather including by leveraging funding and providing investments for community defined projects and strategies b repairing and upgrading the infrastructure in the united states including i by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible ii by guaranteeing universal access to clean water iii by reducing the risks posed by climate impacts and iv by ensuring that any infrastructure bill considered by congress addresses climate change c meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the united states through clean renewable and zero emission energy sources including i by dramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power sources and ii by deploying new capacity d building or upgrading to energy efficient distributed and smart power grids and ensuring affordable access to electricity e upgrading all existing buildings in the united states and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy efficiency water efficiency safety affordability comfort and durability including through electrification f spurring massive growth in clean manufacturing in the united states and removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and industry as much as is technologically feasible including by expanding renewable energy manufacturing and investing in existing manufacturing and industry g working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the united states to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible including i by supporting family farming ii by investing in sustainable farming and land use practices that increase soil health and iii by building a more sustainable food system that ensures universal access to healthy food h overhauling transportation systems in the united states to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible including through investment in i zero emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing ii clean affordable and accessible public transit and iii high speed rail i mitigating and managing the long term adverse health economic and other effects of pollution and climate change including by providing funding for community defined projects and strategies j removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and reducing pollution by restoring natural ecosystems through proven low tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage such as land preservation and afforestation k restoring and protecting threatened endangered and fragile ecosystems through locally appropriate and science based projects that enhance biodiversity and support climate resiliency l cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned sites ensuring economic development and sustainability on those sites m identifying other emission and pollution sources and creating solutions to remove them and n promoting the international exchange of technology expertise products funding and services with the aim of making the united states the international leader on climate action and to help other countries achieve a green new deal yes this is a batshit crazy idea every home every car every building would have to be retrofitted with these new green renewable energies and that would cost trillions upon trillions of dollars which i m sure occasional cortex believes will be shit out by unicorns on top of a pink cloud or printed out by the government in large quantities if you ve ever read ayn rand s novella anthem you will remember a dystopian society in which people exist and work at the point of a government gun achievement is shunned in favor of forced equality and those who exhibit higher levels of intelligence drive or talent are forced into menial jobs to suppress their abilities and ensure they never consider themselves better stronger or smarter than the most pathetic mental defective anthem is set in a primitive future in which technology and scientific knowledge have been lost because achievement and scientific progress have been banned the tallest building is only three stories sundials keep time and the newest modern invention is the candle the unintended consequences of these insane policies will toss our nation right back to the dark ages because what occasional cortex and her pals are really after is for producers to produce for them to invent shiny new technologies by government mandate they want the inventors the achievers the thinkers and the scientific geniuses whose talents they couldn t hope to match to produce what they want when they wanted and at a value they set at the point of a government gun see scientific progress isn t made for the good of one s parasitic brothers it s made with the knowledge that the latest invention will be valued enough to make the inventor who took the risks and made the sacrifices loads of money which occasional cortex plans to appropriate and redistribute to those who don t have the skill knowledge or abilities to achieve at that level luckily this is occasional cortex s christmas list the list she gives santa when she sits on his lap and jumps up and down in wide eyed excitement and demands a purple pony under her tree it s not serious and it s certainly not viable it s the delusional rambling of an immature self important impudent child who thinks she s entitled to be taken seriously because she managed to hoodwink a bunch of frothing proglodytes into voting for her with a cute twitter presence it s time the adults sent this twit to bed
by paul wallace thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe what s a nigerian citizen to do when there s a presidential election coming up and the two leading candidates are a former dictator who s presided over four years of lackluster growth and an alleged kleptocrat of international repute this is the choice facing africa s largest oil producer and by some measures its largest economy in the feb 16 vote although the field is crowded incumbent muhammadu buhari 76 faces his strongest challenge from atiku abubakar 72 who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007 and has tried and failed several times already to secure the top job buhari who led nigeria briefly in the 1980s as a dictator came back to power four years ago via the ballot box after military rule ended in 1999 he contested several elections unsuccessfully before finally becoming the first opposition figure to win the presidency he describes himself as a converted democrat voters and pundits alike were optimistic that he could diversify the oil dependent economy tackle graft and end boko haram s deadly insurgency while the stern former general has succeeded in stamping out some of the corruption that s long blighted nigeria critics say he s been selective mostly targeting his political opponents they also say he s failed on other issues nicknaming him baba go slow in reference to his age and sluggish response to crises nigeria s per capita gdp current prices data international monetary fund nigeria s economy is still smaller on a per capita basis than it was in 2014 when it was hammered by the crash in crude prices unemployment has surged to a record 23 percent from 6 4 percent at the end of 2014 the stock market has been the world s worst performer since buhari came to office falling more than 50 percent in dollar terms boko haram militants some affiliated with islamic state continue to wreak havoc in the northeast other parts of the country have been roiled by a conflict between farmers and herders that s led to thousands of deaths abubakar widely known as atiku is a father of 26 who has business interests ranging from oil and gas services to food manufacturing he s pledged to loosen the state s grip on the economy end the naira s peg to the dollar and privatize companies including the nigerian national petroleum corp which dominates the local energy industry but for all his market friendly talk he admires the late conservative u k prime minister margaret thatcher many nigerians think he used his past positions in government to enrich himself it s like a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea says andrew niagwan 36 a teacher in the central city of jos who doesn t know if he ll vote buhari s got good intentions but he doesn t seem very capable our living standards have dropped in recent years as for atiku nigerians are wary because of all the allegations surrounding him a u s senate report in 2010 concluded that abubakar and one of his wives had wired 40 million of suspect funds into american accounts and said that his business dealings raise a host of questions about the nature and source of his wealth although he has denied the claims and has never been indicted at home or abroad abubakar hasn t been able to shake the perception of impropriety in january he met with lawmakers in washington after having been banned from the country for more than a decade under a state department edict against politicians linked to foreign corruption according to former u s officials a spokesperson for abubakar s campaign denies he d been banned from the u s and the state department declined to comment on the visit investors expect nigerian assets to rise if abubakar wins as much as buhari has done in terms of tackling corruption under his guidance the economy has been quite stagnant says christopher dielmann an economist at exotix capital in london the perception is that under atiku a degree of corruption could return to the country but that might bring with it higher economic growth still any bounce could be short lived abubakar may not risk the political fallout from trying to sell state assets or as he s also promised removing a cap that keeps nigeria s gasoline prices among the cheapest in the world i m doubtful there d be any great change with the economy no matter who gets elected says john campbell a former u s ambassador to nigeria who s now a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations in washington that s a major problem he says as the united nations projects nigeria s population will double to 410 million by 2050 how on earth can you grow an economy fast enough to accommodate those numbers new york based risk consultant eurasia group which included nigeria on its list of the top 10 global risks for 2019 predicts buhari will be reelected but even if steadier oil prices mean the worst is over it won t be an easy four years the country might just muddle through for now says amaka anku head of africa at eurasia the next election in 2023 could be an inflection point she says there s a real chance that a reformist government emerges then with tope alake bottom line no matter who wins nigeria s presidential election the economy is unlikely to improve setting up the nation for a humanitarian catastrophe in the coming decades

joining us today phillips 66 delivered another quarter of strong operating performance and record setting financial results for 2018 adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were a record 2 3 billion or 4 87 per share and we generated 4 1 billion of operating cash flow we rewarded our shareholders with strong distributions during the quarter returning 864 million through dividends and share repurchases refining operated at 99 capacity utilization and we toward heavy canadian crude and other advantaged crudes throughout our refining system to capture strong margins in midstream we benefited from increased pipeline internal throughput across our integrated network for the year adjusted earnings were 5 6 billion or 11 71 per share we generated 7 6 billion of operating cash flow the record financial performance in 2018 demonstrates our refining portfolio s ability to run well and capture market opportunities marketing provided pull through of our refined products to achieve record adjusted earnings also contributing to our strong results were the midstream and chemicals growth projects which were placed in the service during the past two years in 2018 we increased the quarterly dividend 14 and repurchased 10 of the shares outstanding resulting in 6 1 billion of capital being returned to our shareholders since 2012 we returned 22 5 billion to shareholders through dividends share repurchases and exchanges reducing our initial shares outstanding by 30 disciplined capital allocation is a priority and we are committed to a secure competitive and growing dividend as we look to 2019 we expect to deliver another double digit dividend increase through our ongoing share repurchase program we continue to buy shares when they trade below intrinsic value as demonstrated by our fourth quarter pace of repurchases phillips 66 partners achieved its five year 30 cagr target it also delivered industry leading distribution growth since its ipo in 2013 with its scale financial strength and project opportunities psxp is well positioned to fund and sustain organic program to continue to drive ebitda growth we are investing in robust portfolio projects across our businesses with attractive returns to create shareholder value the gray oak pipeline will provide 900 000 barrels a day of crude oil transportation from the permian and the eagle ford to texas gulf coast destinations including our sweeny refinery the project is supported by shipper commitments and is on schedule to be in service by the end of this year phillips 66 partners is the operator and the largest owner gray oak will connect with multiple terminals in corpus christi including the south texas gateway terminal in which psxp has a 25 ownership the marine terminal will have two deep water docks planned storage capacity of 6 5 million to 7 million barrels and is expected to start up in mid 2020 at the sweeny hub we re building two 150 000 barrel per day ngl fractionators and adding 6 million barrels of storage at phillips 66 partners clemens caverns the hub will have 400 000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity and 15 million barrels of storage when the expansion is completed in late 2020 we continue to have strong interest from customers in additional fractionation expansion projects the growth in domestic crude production is expected to result in an increased need for gulf coast exports we re making investments at our beaumont terminal to capitalize on this opportunity during the fourth quarter we placed 1 3 million barrels of fully contracted new crude oil storage into service this brings the terminal s total capacity to 14 6 million barrels construction is under way to further increase crude storage by 2 2 million barrels with completion anticipated in early 2020 dcp midstream has a 25 interest in the gulf coast express pipeline project and will transport approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the permian to gulf coast markets completion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 in the high growth dj basin dcps o connor 2 plant is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019 cpchem s new gulf coast petrochemical assets are running well and generating strong free cash flow a second gulf coast project is expected to include both ethylene and derivative capacity is under development cpchem is also evaluating additional capacity increases across multiple product lines through debottlenecked opportunities in refining we continue to focus on high return projects to improve margins we have an fcc upgrade project under way at sweeny refinery that will increase production of higher valued petrochemical products and higher octane gasoline this project is planned to be complete in the second quarter of 2020 during the fourth quarter we completed crude unit modifications at our lake charles refinery to run additional advantaged domestic crudes also at lake charles phillips 66 partners is constructing a 25 000 barrel per day isom unit to increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components this unit is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year as we move into 2019 we remain focused on operating excellence and executing on our strong portfolio of growth projects we are optimistic about the future opportunities across our businesses and we ll invest in projects with attractive returns disciplined capital allocation is fundamental to our strategy and we ll continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and with that i ll turn the call over to kevin to review the financials kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you greg hello everyone starting with an overview on slide four we summarize our financial results for the year 2018 adjusted earnings were 5 6 billion or 11 71 per share we generated 7 6 billion of operating cash flow including 2 9 billion in distributions from equity affiliates with approximately 1 billion each from cpchem and wrb this is the highest annual earnings and operating cash flow we have delivered since our company s inception at the end of the fourth quarter the net debt to capital ratio was 23 our return on capital employed for the year was 17 slide five shows the change in cash during the year we began the year with 3 1 billion in cash on our balance sheet cash from operations excluding the impact of working capital was 7 9 billion working capital changes reduced cash flow by 300 million we received 1 billion from the net issuance of debt during the year we funded 2 6 billion of capital expenditures and investments paid dividends of 1 4 billion and repurchased 4 7 billion of our shares representing 10 of shares outstanding our ending cash balance was 3 billion slide six summarizes our fourth quarter results adjusted earnings were 2 3 billion and adjusted earnings per share was 4 87 we generated operating cash flow of 4 1 billion including distributions from equity affiliates of 840 million capital spending for the quarter was approximately 1 billion with 648 million spent on growth projects we returned 864 million to shareholders through 367 million of dividends and 497 million of share repurchases we ended the year with 456 million shares outstanding moving to slide seven as i mentioned on last quarter s call we have changed our segment reporting to a pre tax basis income taxes are reflected at the consolidated company level this change makes our segment reporting more comparable with our peers this slide highlights the change in pre tax income by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter quarter over quarter adjusted earnings increased 804 million driven by higher results in refining marketing and midstream partially offset by lower chemicals results the fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21 slide eight shows our midstream results fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income for the segment was 409 million an increase of 97 million from the previous quarter midstream full year adjusted pre tax income was a record 1 2 billion more than 600 million higher than the prior year transportation adjusted pre tax income for the fourth quarter was 234 million up 25 million from the previous quarter the increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes for both our joint venture and wholly owned assets our operated pipelines benefited from strong utilization at our refineries in addition fourth quarter throughput on the bakken pipeline increased an average more then 500 000 barrels per day ngl and other adjusted pre tax income was 122 million an increase of 48 million primarily from inventory impacts we continue to run well at the sweeny hub during the quarter the export facility averaged 10 cargoes a month and the fractionator averaged 116 utilization dcp midstream adjusted pre tax income of 53 million in the fourth quarter is up 24 million from the previous quarter primarily due to improved hedging results partially offset by higher operating costs during the fourth quarter dcp completed the expansion of the sand hills pipeline capacity to 485 000 barrels per day sand hills is owned two thirds by dcp and one third by phillips 66 partners turning to chemicals on slide nine fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income for the segment was 152 million 111 million lower than the third quarter olefins and polyolefins adjusted pre tax income was 158 million down 67 million from the previous quarter the decrease reflects seasonally lower polyethylene sales volumes and higher turnaround in maintenance costs global o p utilization was 95 in the fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income for sa s decreased 35 million due to lower earnings for cpchem s equity affiliates and higher domestic turnaround costs the 9 million decrease in other reflects the fourth quarter increase of a contingent liability and a gain on an asset sale in the third quarter during the fourth quarter we received 300 million of cash distributions from cpchem next on slide 10 we ll cover refining crude utilization was 99 compared with 93 in the third quarter the fourth quarter clean product yield was 86 and pre tax turnaround costs were 130 million an increase of 75 million from the previous quarter the market crack declined 36 from the previous quarter realized margin was 16 53 per barrel 24 higher than the third quarter the chart on slide 10 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted pre tax income which increased 745 million primarily from strong results in the central corridor and gulf coast regions for the full year refining generated adjusted pre tax income of 4 6 billion the atlantic basin results increased as the bayway refinery returned to normal operations following third quarter downtime gulf coast adjusted pre tax income of 468 million increased 247 million due to higher clean product realizations improved heavy canadian crude oil differentials and increased volumes at the alliance refinery following third quarter downtime the higher clean product realizations benefited from declining market prices capacity utilization in the gulf coast region was 100 adjusted pre tax income in the central corridor was 1 2 billion an increase of 342 million reflecting expanded discounts on canadian crudes capacity utilization in the central corridor was 106 in the west coast the increase was mainly due to higher realized margins driven by widening crude differentials partially offset by higher turnaround costs slide 11 covers market capture the 3 2 1 market crack for the fourth quarter was 9 11 per barrel compared to 14 21 per barrel in the third quarter the realized margin was 16 53 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 181 market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries we make less gasoline and more distillate than premised in the 3 2 1 market crack the gasoline crack spread declined by 8 75 per barrel during the quarter while the distillate crack improved by 2 20 per barrel losses from secondary products of 0 29 per barrel were improved a 1 33 per barrel from the previous quarter due to the decline in crude oil prices relative to ngl fuel oil and coke advantaged feedstocks improved realized margins by 3 79 per barrel an improvement of a 1 29 per barrel from the prior quarter primarily due to widening canadian crude differentials the other category improved realized margins by 3 57 per barrel primarily due to optimization across our logistics network to capture market opportunities associated with widening crude differentials realized margins were further improved by gulf coast clean product price realizations moving to marketing and specialties on slide 12 adjusted fourth quarter pre tax income was a record 592 million 207 million higher than the third quarter marketing and other increased 205 million from improved margins associated with sharply following spot prices refined product exports in the fourth quarter were a record 249 000 barrels per day we reimaged 466 domestic branded sites during the fourth quarter bringing the total to approximately 2 600 since the start of our program for 2019 an additional 1 800 sites are scheduled for reimaging specialties adjusted pre tax income increased 2 million during the quarter primarily due to higher lubricants margins on slide 13 the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre tax costs of 201 million improved 22 million from the prior quarter lower net interest expense was due to interest income on a higher average cash balance and increased capitalized interest the corporate overhead cost decrease was due to employee severance costs recognized in the third quarter this concludes my review of the financial and operating results next i ll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year in chemicals we expect the first quarter global o p utilization rate to be in the mid 90s in refining we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid 80s and pre tax turnaround expenses to be between 140 million and 170 million we anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between 210 million and 240 million pre tax for 2019 we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between 550 million and 600 million pre tax we expect corporate and other costs to be in the range of 850 million to 900 million pre tax for the year we anticipate full year of d a of about 1 4 billion and finally we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low 20s with that we ll now open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session as we open the call for questions as a courtesy to all participants please limit yourselves to one question and one follow up question operator instructions phil gresh from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open phil gresh jpmorgan analyst hi and congratulations on a solid quarter here greg i guess the first question here would be if you look back at 2018 i mean this is the third straight quarter where you ve handled you ve beaten the consensus expectations it seems to be driven by different parts of the portfolio obviously refining has been strong but even other parts of the portfolio have been very strong as well so how do you think about the performance this year do you see some kind of sustainable structural improvement going on at phillips that s underappreciated or is this just beat or keeping control of the sell side better greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer you guys are doing a great job phil so look i think that there is no question the market environment we find ourselves is playing to the strength of our portfolio and it s two things it s distillate right and differentials and so no question in the fourth quarter the wcs differential drove a lot of the value creation we improved our distillate yield we re up another 1 in the fourth quarter so 90 39 distillate yield so versus our peers who were at the high end of the range on distillate and given our coking capacity and our ability to run heavy is differential the other thing i would just say is we got the these chemicals assets are up they re running they re performing well that s going to continue to drive earnings improvement versus mid cycle for us then you think about our midstream business starting to kick in we actually made more in midstream than we made in chemicals in 2018 so across the portfolio the things we ve been investing in are starting to show up and deliver value and then finally we continue to run really well operational excellence is key for us we continue to emphasize that in the quarter where we needed to run well i mean we run ran 106 utilization and central corridor ran a 100 on the gulf coast and it showed up as value so i don t know jeff if you have any comments on other structural changes jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think the projects that greg is talking about 1 5 billion of ebitda and incremental projects added across kind of evenly distributed between chemicals midstream and refining that s improved our overall cash flow from operations in a normalizing environment greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would probably say given kind of normalized mid cycle we used to say 4 billion to 5 billion we re kind of 6 billion to 7 billion now of cash flow on a normalized basis phil gresh jpmorgan analyst got it ok thanks i guess second question just looking at the guidance for the first quarter the mid 80s utilization in refining and the turnaround costs there would you say that the entire impact on utilization is the turnarounds or are you seeing an environment here for yourselves or for the industry that is warranting some run cuts here in the first quarter greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer most of that guidance is centered around turnaround activity we ve pulled a few things maybe from the back half of the year into the front half of the year where we could making sure that we can run in the back half but that s around the margin phil there wasn t a lot of work there so it s mostly focused around our turnaround activity phil gresh jpmorgan analyst got it ok one last one just for kevin how do you feel about the balance sheet levels here obviously earlier in the year you issued some debt to buyback some shares finishing the year really strong on cash flow clearly so how do you feel about desires to pay down debt from here kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah phil so we feel pretty good about where we got to in fact we basically we replenished the cash from where we had been with the strong third and fourth quarter this year so 3 billion of cash debt to cap is 29 on a fully consolidated basis 23 net of cash so we feel good on that we have some debt that s available for paydown but we ll look at that in the overall context of how the start of the year shakes out we ll have a little bit of turnaround on working capital that s typically a use of cash in the first quarter and so we d expect to see that happen as it typically does but the nice thing is we have a lot of flexibility to work through so if we have weak margins for any kind of extended period we have the flexibility to continue to work through that and fund all of our obligations phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay thanks i ll turn it over greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer thanks phil operator doug terreson with evercore isi please go ahead your line is open doug terreson evercore isi analyst good morning everybody greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey doug kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning doug terreson evercore isi analyst guys your 17 return on capital employed and your 10 reduction in shares outstanding are the best in the us energy industry so kudos to the team on exceptional results that s really good work there and my yeah my question is on your outlook for key businesses and starting with refining with margins on variable costs for conversion capacity unusually low do you think that utilization is going to decline for some of these processes there because weakness is often seasonal this time of the year throughput is going to remain high but so the question is how are you guys thinking about managing conversion utilization given these circumstances and also how do you think it plays out across the industry greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so i ll take a stab and jeff can correct me how about that so look i think that everyone s concerned about the high gasoline inventories at this point in the cycle there s no question in the fourth quarter the market environment was encouraging you to run given the diesel cracks that we had and gasoline cracks weren t that great but we re heading into the spring turnaround season there are some operational issues out there so our assessment is we re probably a little above normal in terms of outages for this time of year then you get to the propane butane in gasoline it comes out of the gasoline pool that s all directionally helpful for gasoline we re still constructive overall demand we think gasoline demand in north america is going to be flat for 2019 we see distillate demand up 1 2 1 3 in that range and a new add on imo and i know there s a debate about imo and that but there s still going to be some level of tailwind so as we look at 2019 for the year we re still mid cycle or better in terms of refining cracks doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst okay thanks greg jeff did you want to say anything or did he cover it jeff dietert vice president investor relations i think he covered it well doug terreson evercore isi analyst okay i didn t mean to interrupt anyway on chemicals you guys jeff dietert vice president investor relations go ahead doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst well i was just going to ask a question about chemicals and specifically you guys have strength capacity in the last couple of years and you seem positioned for more spending in the area based on greg s comments today so just want to get an update on your constructive view on chemicals which is a little bit more constructive than some and so the basis for increased investment in that area why are you guys optimistic for chemicals greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah so first of all you think about a growing global economy and albeit 19 is probably going to be a lower growth year than what 18 is globally but we re still constructive demand strictly for polyethylene which is mostly what cpchem makes in our view is demand is going to grow faster than capacity in 2019 so it should be constructive for operating rates and margins 2019 and then you look at all the advantaged feedstocks they re still available in the us doug and so that really says you should build into that if you have a great position which cpchem does access to advantaged feedstocks great technology great return on business and so it s a business that we should want to invest into jeff dietert vice president investor relations polyethylene grew by 6 last year substantially above gdp growth we did have some weakness in the fourth quarter we experienced the typical seasonal softness in demand but it was compounded by 35 decline in crude prices as we started the year margins were soft but crude prices have rebounded and cpchem seeing signs of demand improvement healthy demand is expected to drive some polyethylene price increases in the first quarter operator neil mehta from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open neil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning team and i ll add my congratulations on a good quarter here greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer thanks neil neil mehta goldman sachs analyst the kickoff question from me is on western canadian crude differentials which obviously were big tailwind in 4q and have reversed here in 1q our view is that it ultimately will settle out toward transportation economics which is wider than here but just your latest thoughts on how this plays out in 2019 and then longer term is there still a lot of uncertainty around the pipe and how you re adjusting your business to take advantage of that jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we ve gone from an unsustainably wide discount for canadian heavy to an unsustainably narrow discount we believe with the mandated cuts there was substantially more volume that came off the market than what the 325 million targeted amount was we also had some economic run reductions production reductions and so we are running well below what the producing capacity is in canada we do expect similar to your comments to move to rail economics as this passes i think a number of the canadian producers have argued for moving away from the mandate and so we expect the differentials to go back to kind of rail economics wti minus 20 something in that area neil mehta goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and then the follow up is something a little bit more specific slide 11 of your deck on refining margins kevin you walked through configuration of feedstock that made a lot of sense the other number felt bigger than normal 3 57 but it was a big part of the strength in the realized market can you talk about what that is in a little bit more detail and how should we think about that is that just a function of crude prices coming down precipitously or can we carry any of that forward kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer so you re partly on to that neil it does cover there are a variety of things in that other category but the big drivers for why that s a positive of 3 plus per barrel this time is a function of one realizing stronger prices on product realizations a lot of which is a function of the declining the overall declining market helped on the product price realizations and then the other is just on the crude side the crude differential side being able to optimize how we are moving barrels around our network to capture opportunities as they are available which in that kind of market environment we saw in the fourth quarter so it lent itself to us being able to do that so you think about both of those and not really it was good to have in the fourth quarter good that we could capture it but not something you d assume as ratable operator blake fernandes with piper jaffray please go ahead your line is open blake fernandez piper jaffray analyst guys good morning and congrats as well on the strong print there i know you covered chemicals already but in the release you talked a little bit about some potential debottlenecking and i was hoping you could maybe elaborate a little bit on that i m assuming that s totally separate from a potential second crack or just trying to get a sense of how significant that could be and maybe timing around that kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah blake it s kevin in terms of the debottleneck opportunities those are not of anything like the scale of the next major expansion major project i e a second cracker project these are what i would consider to be in a portfolio like cpchem has we re always able to identify opportunities for incremental investment to drive incremental production and usually very strong returns on those investments so i don t think we look at any one of those as significantly large but they typically screen pretty high to the list of priorities for investment because by nature of them being incremental to the existing portfolio usually very attractive returns greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so gulf coast project was by 33 capacity increase i mean debottleneck is typically on the order of 5 maybe 10 blake and but it s not across all the products we have very specific places where we think we can get some more capacity out of the derivatives and actually some of the ethylene units too but they re certainly worth pursuing when you look at the returns blake fernandez piper jaffray analyst yeah got it the second one really is just on i guess is focused on moving toward light sweet given the compression and heavy differentials in the market so maybe if you could just give an update on where you are on your system as far as ability to flex back and forth between light sweet and then i guess while we re on it maybe the same with the distillate and gasoline if you re at max distillate mode at this point jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we have shifted given the economics in the marketplace they have really driven a move toward maxing diesel and so we are there we ve been there and so we are making about as much diesel as we can given the current economics similar on the light product side we re about 50 sweet and 50 sour that s about a 1 million barrels a day or so of sweet crude there s the potential to go maybe another 100 000 barrels a day it s obviously dependent on economics we d need the economic incentive to do that but that s what our upside potential is there operator roger read with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open roger read wells fargo analyst yeah thanks good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good morning jeff dietert vice president investor relations hi roger roger read wells fargo analyst i guess maybe we could talk a little bit about the midstream segment and obviously you ve highlighted gray oak and so forth but as i think about the performance in the quarter looking in the 19 and 20 in an e p industry that seems to be slowing at spending a little bit and maybe slowing production how does that environment compare to the baseline that you ve laid out in terms of your expectation for future pipeline investments and i guess ngl fractionation et cetera as you think about what may get the trigger pulled on it in 19 or 20 and i guess really at the heart of it i m trying to understand what maybe the growth prospects are for the at least tee transportation and ngl side of the midstream as we look over the next year or two greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so i would start with we re just not going to build speculative capacity roger i think that the midstream projects we have in the queue are subscribed with p d and long term contracts these are seven year and 10 year contracts with good counterparties on the other side so i think that s a starting point i think you re right to the extent that they drove results down north america some of these additional investments will slow down so to the extent we can get these things subscribed we re not going to build them that is probably the starting point on that gray oak fully subscribed factory three fully subscribed but it s interesting we re still seeing good interest in additional frac capacity we re out in open seasons in red oak and liberty and i d say interest level is good on those we ll see well i don t know exactly where we will end up yet when people want to sign we just completed successful open season on dapple going to 570 million but we re still seeing good interest level out there from the producers and investing and having infrastructure to clear from the production centers to the market centers jeff do you want to comment jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah there s still substantial resource available and with new infrastructure coming the potential that activity resumes we re looking at ngl production growth that s been around 500 000 barrels a day year on year we re not adding that type of capacity in 2019 and so as production continues to grow the need for infrastructure will continue the challenge is matching the timing with production growth and infrastructure growth and so that s what getting projects fully contracted attempts to do roger read wells fargo analyst okay great thanks and then shifting gears back to refining greg you mentioned kind of a mid cycle or better assumption on margins for refining in 19 seems that on a macro front we get more concerns raised by investors that globally new capacity coming on line will be faster than demand growth not asking you to forecast demand growth that s too tough for any of us but as you think about the new capacity coming online how much of that do you think is really aimed at the transportation market versus what is nominally aimed at the petrochemical side in terms of feedstock greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we have a couple in china one in the middle east coming on in 2019 the transparency into china is probably a little harder for us our view is those two refineries are probably more petrochemical feedstock oriented and less gasoline oriented so and we think that they re probably toward the back half of 2019 so yeah there s capacity that s going to come on this year but i m not sure it s going to be as big a impact strictly to the first half of the year is what some people think jeff you want to comment jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think on the chinese side it s petrochemical focused as greg mentioned but with low diesel yields as well operator paul sankey from mizuho please go ahead your line is open paul sankey mizuho analyst good afternoon everyone greg you made some interesting comments recently to us about china demand keeping on with the general demand picture your sales i think has held up pretty well could you extend on what you were saying about the global markets petrochemicals you also as you may know had excellent saying that this weakness is because of excess capacity which i think you ve really referred to early on in this call but or rather i should say new capacity could you just talk a little bit about how the market could be clearing and particularly the market is still concerned about china anything you could add on that would be interesting thanks greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah absolutely thanks paul well first of all we re still constructive petrochemical demand coming into 2019 still driven by hundreds of millions if not billions of people ultimately coming into the middle class over the next decade or so so i think the fundamentals are set up well there china i mean it s interesting when you see crude prices fall as drastically as they did in the fourth quarter they always slow down because they know that petrochemical prices are going to fall those down and they ll wait time in the bottom and start buying again so we did probably see some slowdown activity in the fourth quarter around china but as we look into china through into the base demand in china it s still pretty healthy i d say north american demand european demand still relatively healthy in terms of growth and so i think that s been the surprise to the upside in the chemicals environment so still constructive i think what i d say is our fundamental view on 2019 for chemicals is that demand on chemicals is going to grow faster than capacity additions and the other thing is we may see some slippage on these other projects that are slated to come up in 2019 paul sankey mizuho analyst great thank you and then the follow up is a pretty large strategy question but it s related to your cash return versus capex framework which is 60 40 as we know at the moment i was wondering over what time frame and for what reasons that my shift given the scale of the company for example is getting so large thanks greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah so if you think about 12 to 18 we and consider our investments in equity affiliates we re right on top of the 60 40 60 reinvested back into our company and 40 back to shareholders who secure growing competitive dividend and share repurchase and exchanges in 2018 we were 60 40 it was just the other way we were 60 distributions and 40 investment back into our business but paul as i think kind of over a three year horizon the mid term most of our projects that we re investing in in midstream or refining we kind of have two year horizons on them the chemicals projects tend to go into a three to four year horizon on them but if i want to think about a three year horizon i still think 60 40 is about the right place for us to be operator paul cheng from barclays please go ahead your line is open paul cheng barclays analyst hey guys good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good morning paul jeff dietert vice president investor relations hey paul paul cheng barclays analyst couple quick questions greg you talked about china can you talk about mexico that where do you see on the export market there that with i mean we have heard early in the year that some widespread fuel shortage that s in the initial or formed an impact your export volume and have you seen any change in the trend that s the first question the second question is on the crude differential exxon has said that in the fourth quarter versus the year before fourth quarter their crude differential inaudible is about 1 2 billion after tax and now when you look at the chart look like it is about 1 6 billion i m wondering that is there a number that you can share jeff dietert vice president investor relations i ll take the mexico question we are seeing some impact on exports to mexico as their demand has gone down with the pipeline shutdowns mexico demand is about 800 000 barrels a day gasoline is about 350 000 barrels a day of diesel they import about 75 of that from the us at least in 2018 as you know refining utilization averaged about 38 last year and we re expecting it to go down lower from that this year we have seen some impact on exports into mexico and those volumes are down we re seeing some signs of movement into some of the interior but some of that demand is going to be lost permanently and as they re able to get product back into the center or country that will resume their imports but we are seeing that down somewhat paul cheng barclays analyst jeff have you seen any sign the export to mexico start to recover or increasing jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we have seen a little bit of a relief recently but it s probably going to be an area we don t have a lot of transparency in as they try to recover from these pipeline outages paul cheng barclays analyst thank you and how about the crude differential greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey paul yeah on your first question when you look at the wcs ti kind of year over year 17 versus 18 it s about 13 and a 1 is about 100 million so on an ebitda basis it s 1 3 billion for us paul paul cheng barclays analyst perfect thank you jeff dietert vice president investor relations thank you operator doug leggate from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead your line is open clay bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys this is clay on for doug thanks for taking the question greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey clay bank of america merrill lynch analyst so my first is on it s a follow up to phil s question about the use of cash just wondering with your balances reloaded does this affirm the high end of your 1 billion to 2 billion buyback target for 2019 greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think we will guide to the range of 1 billion to 2 billion clay bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right my second question is a follow up to neil s question just on the wcf differential the alberta cuts cuts have worked but perhaps they ve worked too well since the dip is now out of the money as it relates to rail so my question is do you see a sharp slowdown in rail and do think that this could be a catalyst for a sharp widening of the dips may be not too october levels but toward that direction jeff dietert vice president investor relations yes we are seeing a reduced utilization of rail as we come into february i believe some of the canadian producers that ship by rail have acknowledged reduction those economics are closed the arm is closed and the marketplace is starting to react greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think it s interesting it looks like to us that we ve pulled inventories which was the whole idea of the government intervention and we ve over shopped on the differential and it looks like to us inventories are starting to build again in canada so i think that we will get back to the point where we have a differential at least a clear by rail and so you think about a fully loaded rail cost kind of 18 to 20 ish a barrel you look at variable cost is probably 15 to 16 so i think we ll get to the variable cost and then we ll move to variable cost as the year goes on operator prashant rao with citigroup please go ahead your line is open prashant rao citigroup analyst thanks good morning and thanks for taking the question my first sort of straddle midstream and refining a bit thinking about storage capacity and needs particularly in the gulf coast and through logistics needs and opportunities over the next couple of years i sort of see at least two event windows here one being imo and i m thinking about longer hydrocarbon chains here in particular medium to longer hydrocarbon chains one is imo we were expecting storage needs for fuel oil storage needs for different sorts of distillates changes in crude trade lanes and dynamics and the second being the wave of barrels that we expect to hit the gulf coast out for export as we get toward 2020 2021 i m curious to know sort of your thoughts on how the existing infrastructure wherever it stands in terms of capacity to handle the demand it will be there along these various lanes and sort of where s the opportunity for phillips since you re invested in projects that are all through the value chain and i figured you might have a view into sort of where the best sort of incremental opportunities are and how these play off against each other jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah so we do expect the growing production to largely be exported as the pipelines are announced most of the major pipelines have associated export terminals tied with them similar to our gray oak and south texas gateway terminal we ve got export capacity out of beaumont and we re continuing to build out that facility we ve got lpg export capability out of sweeny and as more and more fractionation comes online a lot of that lpg is going to be need to be exported and so we do see those opportunities across many of our value chains operator manav gupta with credit suisse please go ahead your line is open manav gupta credit suisse analyst hey guys can you talk about the benefits of bayou bridge on your entire gulf coast refining system and the actual start up date jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah so bayou bridge we have expectations for it to start up in march and provide service into st james bayou bridge also provides service from beaumont into lake charles and our lake charles refinery at lake charles we ve had projects there to increase our ability to use discounted domestic crudes and so we re benefiting there from the bayou bridge access to crudes and then the bayou bridge lake charles the st james provides opportunity for east pipeline which is in open season and that open season is continuing with strong interest and hopefully we ll have more to report on that in the near future manav gupta credit suisse analyst and a quick follow up jeff two areas where you first feel a recession coming is polyethylene demand and distillate demand demand softness is one thing but you re very close to both those end markets is there any sign in any of those two markets that we are probably approaching recession jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think greg covered the polyethylene side of the equation and perhaps more information there but when we look at diesel demand is very strong tonnage up 8 year on year most recent information global airline revenue miles up 6 year on year we re continuing to see strong diesel demand in the markets in which we participate so we don t see any signs as of this point operator chris sighinolfi with jefferies please go ahead your line is open chris sighinolfi jefferies analyst hi greg greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hey chris sighinolfi jefferies analyst thanks for taking my questions i have two and they both relate to marketing and specialties i guess first very strong results here in the fourth quarter and if i look at how things performed versus our expectations and history it appears international fuel margins were particularly bright spot so i m wondering with a near double it s almost a doubling of the foreign margin quarter on quarter i believe it s the second consecutive record for you on fuel margins there just wanted to check kind of about any particular drivers of that and if anything structural is it for it that you ve cautioned us to pay attention to greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i d maybe start with in europe our markets are focused around germany austria switzerland and the uk in germany we had low water levels at the rhine and that presented some logistical challenges and we were able to use our infrastructure and logistic systems to capture some of the opportunity in advantaged as you know we re kind of reimaging rebuilding about 30 new jet sites a year in europe and so we re seeing some increased uplift from that so that s a piece it s i don t know if it s structural or not but it s certainly an adder and then we re moving into uk doing some similar work in the uk around the jet brand in the uk so combination of a logistical opportunity created in the fourth quarter and just some good nice growth opportunities jeff dietert vice president investor relations and i would just add on that the overall environment the falling price environment had the benefit you would expect to see in those markets as well like we saw in the us chris sighinolfi jefferies analyst right all right okay thanks and i guess secondly you ve continued to execute that reimaging effort on the branded sites here you noted in the release i think roughly 2 same store sales growth figure for the reimaged sites last year and i m just curious how that would compare to sites that have yet to be reimaged greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think the 2 is a really good number and it s what we see inside outside in terms of the uplift i mean the sites are certainly more attractive it s drawing people in and they re spending money and that s a whole reason we re doing the campaign operator jason gabelman from cowen and company please go ahead your line is open jason gabelman cowen and company analyst yeah i was going to ask about the international margin so thanks for addressing that i guess my other question is just going back to refining margins wondering with oil prices falling as they did just in terms of the secondary product realizations which geography do you see the highest uplift from those secondary products jeff dietert vice president investor relations we do see uplift across all our regions as you know we have cokers at all our refineries except for ferndale and bayway and so there is some contribution meaningful contribution from all of the different regions we saw it benefit coke ngls and fuel oil during the quarter so it was really across all the products and there was meaningful contributions from each of the regions jason gabelman cowen and company analyst okay so you wouldn t say just in a more general way that one region tends to benefit more than others it sounds like jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s across the board jason gabelman cowen and company analyst all right and then just a quick follow up it looks like capex ran a little high and 4q obviously not a big concern given the cash flow you generated in the quarter but i was just wondering what that was from and if that resulting in maybe capex coming in a bit lower next year kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer this is kevin you just look at the two large projects that we sanctioned last year and the timing of when the spend really started to ramp up on those so that was gray oak and the expansion of the sweeny hub with the additional fractionation capacity and so you re just seeing the impact of the spend level ramping up on those projects and that s already factored into our capital budget for 2019 that we communicated back in december operator matthew blair from tudor pickering holt please go ahead your line is open matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning everyone it seems like your gulf coast refining system really outperformed peers you think that was the result of bringing down the wcs barrels or was there anything unusual or anything that stood out this quarter jeff dietert vice president investor relations i think as we optimize across the integrated logistics network we did are able to allocate the canadian heavy volumes to the area that are most beneficial we did consume a fair amount of canadian heavy in the gulf coast we also benefit from the wide bakken differential with the bakken pipeline feeding into the gulf coast and across bayou bridge into lake charles so those were big contributions configuration is a meaningful impact on gulf coast because we produce less gasoline and more diesel than is in the 3 2 1 product realizations from pricing lags in a declining oil price environment were positive and i think finally the alliance refinery was down for maintenance during part of the third quarter and ran during the fourth quarter so we had higher volumes and lower turnaround expense there kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer 100 utilization for the region for the quarter always helps to matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst sounds good and what kind of impact if any are you expecting from this recent keystone pipeline outage jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a little bit early to know what the impact is going to be we are a shipper on the pipe so there is the potential for some impact but we will have to wait and see what the details of that situation are greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer we got to work around we actually talked about that this morning i guess platte is down too so we re i think we re prepared but again as jeff said i think we need to see more details about how long the pipe is going to be down operator we have now reached the time limit available for questions i would now turn the call back over to jeff jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah thank you julie and thank all of you for your interest in phillips 66 if you have additional questions please call brent or me thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference you may now disconnect duration 60 minutes call participants jeff dietert vice president investor relations greg c

by david stockman we attended our first of five state of the union sotu speeches as a young congressional aide beginning way back in 1971 followed by four more as a congressman from michigan and then the opportunity to march into the hall as a member of ronald reagan s cabinet five additional times after that came another 30 or so sotus these ones beaming from our home boob tube in the civilian world so we have no illusions about the purpose of sotus they re about flag waving gallery guest parading constituency pandering promise making potus boasting partisan bragging bipartisanship feinting rhetorical flourishing and patriotic posturing what they don t address is anything serious about governance policy or the actual state of the union needless to say the donald checked the box on both of these dimensions last night beginning with his rhetorical flourishes when we heard the following passage we thought for a moment that he was cribbing from woody guthrie s this land is your land but we then remembered woody was actually a communist and that the string of lefties who subsequently recorded his ode to america pete seeger bob dylan arlo guthrie lead belly and joan baez weren t too far removed here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california in fact a very large portion of teleprompter donald s 82 minute read through third in length only behind two bill clinton sotus which lasted 84 and 89 minutes respectively might well have been embraced by woody guthrie himself after all the commies were actually on our side back when the donald s three octogenarian gallery guests private riley sergeant locker and sergeant zeitchik landed on the normandy beaches in june 1944 and when it came to liberating nazi concentration camps it was actually the red army that ended the horror shows at auschwitz birkeneau belzec treblinka sachenhausen and ravensbrueck of course when you have to reach back 75 years to establish common ground or even 50 years to a moon walking buzz aldrin it tells you something about the fraught climate of the current moment still there wasn t alot the assembled dems congressional ladies in white and washington pooh bahs apparatchiks and factotums could take issue with in much of the speech s airballs such as the the following call to bigger and better things now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach we can make our community safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before needless to say that s the kind of motherhood and apple pie that every president bloviates about but it s the we part of it which ought to give pause that s because in these flourishes the donald and all his predecessors are not talking about some grand united way outpouring of voluntary citizen action at the grass roots the we here is the central state it s the washington leviathan horning into every nook and cranny of american life in the name of economic uplift and social betterment outcomes which are actually not in its power to deliver or within its constitutional remit to pursue likewise the donald went on an extended rife about the virtues and glories of bipartisanship but that was the javanka wing of the white house speaking lest we forget trump was not elected to embrace the bipartisan establishment he was chosen by the desperate citizens of flyover america to disrupt it to discredit its self serving and counter productive assault on capitalist prosperity constitutional liberty and honest democratic self government indeed when the donald uttered the following words no one sitting on their hands on the dem side of the aisle believed it anyway so why not remind the 46 million tv viewers last night that the assembled bipartisan party of the status quo is what threatens america s financial and political future that is there are deep policy and philosophical differences between the power and privileges of the washington governing class on the one side and the needs and rights of the main street citizenry on the other and that the raucous disorder in the imperial city at present represents the deep state s attempt to repel an unwelcome intervention by the unwashed electorate in their own supposed process of self governance what needs to be broken in fact is not political stalemate as trump averred but the baleful status quo of empire abroad and debt and speculation fueled financial bubbles and artificial prosperity at home together we can break decades of political stalemate we can bridge all divisions we can bridge old divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of america s future the decision is ours to make what these words and much else in the 82 minutes really told us is that the great disrupter was mia last night he s now focused on re election at all hazards even if it requires dutifully lip synching the words written by jared ivanka mnuchin and their coterie of ill informed philosophically neuter power seeking swells in all it led to a rhetorical crescendo that most definitely was not about the fractured polity wizened economy and egregiously inflated financial bubble and mal distribution of wealth that defines the actual state of the union indeed the donald ended up talking rank nonsense somehow implying that the state of the union is rock solid and that from a booming trumpian economy there is nothing ahead but unicorns and rainbows and ever more magnificent feats of national grandeur together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history what will we do with this moment how will we be remembered i ask the men and women of this congress look at the opportunities before us our most thrilling achievements are still ahead our most exciting journeys still await our biggest victories are still to come we have not yet begun to dream we must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them we must choose whether we squander our inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are americans we do the incredible we defy the impossible we conquer the unknown this is the time to re ignite the american imagination this is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens as neighbors as patriots this is our future our fate and our choice to make i am asking you to choose greatness no matter the trials we face no matter the challenges to come we must go forward together when push comes to shove the great disrupter went a long way to proving himself not all that last night beneath his serial tweetstorms it now seems clear the donald is just another statist at heart who has a fondness for debt anti immigrant demoguery and 17th century mercantilism economic delusions last night s boasting about the hottest economy in the world made it abundantly clear that there is nothing strategic or even tactical about the donald s foolish embrace of an aging stock market bubble and wizened economic cycle it s just a glandular lurch the impulsive action of an incorrigible megalomaniac grasping for anything which can be portrayed as a personal win including even dodgy successes like the u 3 unemployment rate that are sure to implode at any moment in the months ahead in fact the trump boom which the donald embraced with all fours again last night will prove to be the most lunatic stock market mania of modern times as its implosion now gathers force even the casino revilers will soon be shaking their heads in a grand consternated chorus of what were we thinking the truth is the main street economy went essentially nowhere during the radically lopsided post crisis recovery since 2009 where wall street boomed and main street flat lined and aside from short run aberrations in the recent headline gdp numbers which resulted from the trump s impending trade wars and tax cuts financed by uncle sam s credit card the main street economy has not accelerated in the slightest for example the chart below shows seasonally adjusted annualized rates of change for real final sales the latter is a more stable and indicative figure than real gdp because it excludes highly volatile quarter to quarter changes in the rates of inventory stocking and destocking which essentially wash out to zero over any meaningful period of time you don t need a calculator to see that there is essentially no difference in the fluctuating quarter to quarter growth rates during the past seven quarters of the trump economy compared to results during the obama presidency after the us economy had dug out from the great recession in fact the average real final sales growth rate under obama s last 11 quarters was 2 53 per annum and under trump it s been 2 67 we d call that close enough to the same thing for government work and also tepid on both accounts moreover the more salient point is that 90 of the gain depicted by each of the red bars below reflects not the fruits of white house policy machinations but the workers entrepreneurs and companies of capitalist america pushing the ball of economic activity forward yard by yard quarter after quarter just like they always do no matter who is president and no matter how strong the policy headwinds emanating from washington indeed the great scam of the present era is the bipartisan lie under which washington policy makers take full credit for growth and jobs as if the 20 trillion american economy would be one great big stagnant void without monetary and fiscal stimulus from washington that s just plain tommyrot but like his predecessors before the donald has embraced the delusion that it s his economy hook line and sinker as we have demonstrated elsewhere monetary stimulus after 2008 essentially never left the canyons of wall street and fiscal deficits never really stimulate unless they are monetized by the fed but in today s world fed bond buying only fuels financial asset inflation not main street activity in fact the only contribution to growth attributable to either of the last two presidents is a negative one that is both obama and trump heavily mortgaged future taxpayers as they attempted to inject borrowed spending power into the short term gdp prints but that s nothing to boast about since these obligations will eventually take a far greater toll in debt service payments and reduced growth over the indefinite future in any event there is no more comprehensive measure of current activity rates in america s 2o trillion economy than real final sales and by that core metric the main street economy was essentially chopping slowly forward under obama alas that punctuated pace of slow advance has not accelerated one bit since the donald moved into the oval office including the mere 1 5 growth rate of the most recent quarter q3 2018 to be sure the u 3 unemployment rate is a pretty lousy statistic and misleading measure of labor market conditions but notwithstanding its manifold defects it is self evident that the u 3 unemployment rate tracks the natural growth of american capitalism during a business cycle expansion and that there has been no meaningful acceleration from the pre existing downward trend since january 2017 technically speaking in fact during 2010 2016 the unemployment rate declined by 0 7 per month and during the 22 months on the donald s watch the decline has averaged 0 6 per month likewise on a nonfarm payroll count basis the jobs gains was 208 000 per month during obama s last 22 months and 196 000 per month during the first 22 months on the donald s watch unless you have the gop talking points therefore this chart will give you no hint as to when the donald took over and turned around the failing obama economy that s because he actually didn t accordingly the above chart is not any kind of success marker at all it s a clanging warning bell that unless the economic gods have abolished recessions the likely future direction of the red line in the graph is up and smartly so the same kind of cyclical fortuity also pertains to the donald s boasting about workers finally getting a wage gain as purportedly reflected in the most recent year 0ver year gain of 3 2 in fact the september 2018 nominal wage gain red line is about at the lowest it s been since the late 1960s and in real terms the story is even worse to wit between 1955 and 2000 inflation adjusted compensation per hour purple line grew at a 1 75 annual rate and that s the average across seven business cycle including recession years by contrast we are now at the top of the second longest business expansion in history and real compensation was up just 0 1 over the 12 months ending in september that s not even up it s a rounding error that s right siting check by jowl at the no change level the purple line below shows that year over year real wage growth has now clocked in at virtually the weakest late cycle gain on record finally there is the matter of the crisis on the mexican border that is no such thing the donald had not a single word to say about the massive even existential fiscal calamity barreling down the pike but what amounts to an unreality tv crisis about marauding immigrants and menacing caravans largely manufactured by fox news took up most of what passed for policy content in the donald s otherwise content free teleprompt needless to say the whole border war thing is a completely fake crisis if there ever was one contrary to the donald s sotu bombast there is no horde of entrants swarming the border no outbreak of crime on the us side of the line and absolutely no shred of a national security threat whatsoever as to the alleged hordes of menacing immigrants you only need to glance at the chart below to see that is pure fox news bunkum the 310 000 unauthorized immigrant apprehensions at the southwest us border in 2017 in fact represented a 78 plunge from the level in the year 2000 and when it comes to mexican migrants the decline has been nearly 90 likewise there is no evidence of crime spilling over the borders to the contrary on three leading measures of crimes per 100 000 population in 2017 the counties which border mexico have lower rates than for the rest of the us for example there are 3 4 homicides per 100 000 in the border counties compared to a 5 2 per 100 000 rate in the rest of the us in the case of the property crime rate it is 2 207 100 000 in the border counties and 2 256 100 000 in the rest of the country and when it comes to all violent crimes including assault battery rape muggings etc the rate is 348 100 000 in the border counties and 379 100 000 in the rest of the nation indeed on the crime flowing over the border file the donald pulled a downright fast one in his speech he again cited ice arrest statistics which suggested that a huge share of these cases involved illegals who had previously been convicted of a crime and in many cases violent ones but here s the thing the immigration and customs enforcement agency ice doesn t patrol the borders for better or ill it is in the deportation business and as a matter of operating procedure targets likely criminals for its raids and arrests throughout the interior of the usa that is there is an inherent high criminal ratio in the ice arrest statistics because that exactly what its mission entails by contrast it is the border patrol which picks up illegals along the border for the year 2018 through august 31 it apprehended 361 993 undocumented immigrants but only 6 259 or 1 7 had a prior criminal record according to border patrol data moreover 3 600 or 58 of these criminals were actually circular criminals that is they had previously been convicted of illegal entry into the u s a misdemeanor or reentry a felony another 1 000 had been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in fact among last years 361 993 apprehended illegal border crossers there were only three convictions for manslaughter which implies a rate per 100 000 that is 75 lower than for the general us population and a total of 506 convictions for assault battery or domestic violence which also implies a rate far below the us average yes there is a serious crime problem associated with the mexican border but it is one manufactured in the legislative chambers of washington not along a fenceless border we are referring of course to the war on drugs which makes prohibited substances immensely and artificially valuable thereby fueling a massive violent underground distribution system that is the number one source of violent crime in america to be sure many if not most illegal drugs can be harmful to personal health or even fatal just like cigarettes too much alcohol or kentucky fried chicken or sky diving but the distributors of marlboros and jim beam don t kill people who distribute their product or inflict violent mayhem on neighborhoods in order to enforce business deals such as cartel territorial rights there is no better evidence for this than what is now happening in states where weed has been made legal according to a recent story about oregon there is now a glut of producers and a 70 decline in prices which is the very opposite of the kind of high priced scarcity that results from drug prohibition in fact as drug prices fall to free market clearing levels the criminal gangs and cartels would be squeezed out because they couldn t possibly compete with legitimate commercial businesses the irony here is that two of trump s gallery guests were actually victims of washington s failed war on drugs who unjustly spent years in prison for petty distribution yet repeal the drug war and crime at the border will disappear and offer anyone who wants a job a guest worker permit and the human trafficking will disappear too so will the need for the donald s vaunted steel slate barrier yet long before he figures that out the monumental fiscal debauch he has exacerbated and the massive wall street bubble he has foolishly embraced braced will come crashing down on his head when that happens the work of the great disrupter will finally be done david stockman was director of the office of management and budget under president ronald reagan after leaving the white house stockman had a 20 year career on wall street the above originally appeared at david stockman s contra corner at the end of the day most of the donald s boasting about the greatest economy ever amounts to claiming credit for the daily sunrise thus having entered office at the top of a labored but long running business expansion which is now in month 115 trump inherited 83 of the improvement in the unemployment rate shown below between the 10 0 recessionary

this article originally appeared on the conversation as political and economic crises threaten to topple venezuela s president nicolás maduro political scientists like us are not surprised that he has run into trouble instead we see venezuela as another example of what scholars call the resource curse that s the unfortunate correlation first described by the british economic geographer richard m auty between nations with vast wealth from oil or other natural resources and political instability venezuela is a textbook case of the curse since nearly 90 percent of its people are now living in poverty in the country with the world s largest oil reserves after decades of leaders who failed to harness this commodity for peace and prosperity it is questionable whether a new government can do a better job only a few oil and natural gas rich countries such as the united states canada and norway have avoided this curse in part because they built solid institutions and diverse economies before their petroleum drilling began the resource curse the resource curse has afflicted many latin american countries with profligate and populist elected leaders who succumbed to the temptations of corruption and reckless spending when easy money poured in followed by right wing dictatorships imposing repressive technocracies oil and wealth from other commodities like gold and copper and foreign aid have also supported kleptocrats and dictatorships who have often used their fortunes to retain power in other regions the scholars terry karl and thad dunning have persuasively argued that oil export revenue helped sustain venezuelan democracy from the 1950s to the early 1980s the government they explained could buy support from the elite with lower taxes and from the poor with social programs oil money in short can sustain whatever government is in power be it dictatorship or democracy but when crude prices fall the loss of revenue polarizes politics as the wealthy and the poor fight over the reduced proceeds and when these countries not only rely on one export but also very limited markets that adds to their vulnerability oil sales constituted 98 percent of venezuela s export earnings in 2017 with the u s buying nearly half of the country s exported crude boom and bust after several decades of strong economic performance backed by comparatively impressive social programs venezuela s economy started to sputter in the 1980s the vast sums of money it had borrowed a decade earlier backed by future oil revenues were coming due by that time president carlos andrés pérez who had presided over strong economic growth between 1974 and 1979 returned to power in 1989 however this time the country faced a weak currency rising poverty rates and increased foreign and public debt in combination with low oil prices to stabilize the economy pérez implemented austerity policies that deregulated capital markets and reduced price controls on gasoline and other products these measures exacerbated economic hardships for the poor and venezuelans took to the streets to protest in deadly riots known as the caracazo pérez survived two coup attempts in 1992 only to be impeached and forced out of office for embezzlement in 1993 popular anger against economic conditions and the dominant political class led voters to back more polarizing politicians the first coup attempt against pérez in 1992 was organized by hugo chávez then a lieutenant colonel who famously exclaimed to the nation that he had failed for now he was right just six years later in 1998 he ran for president and won an overwhelming victory building support luckily for chávez oil prices had started to rise again eventually reaching record levels while he was in power aside from a brief downturn brought on by the great recession those high oil prices raised enough revenue to help sustain his support he gained extra revenue by restructuring petróleos de venezuela pdvsa the country s state owned oil and natural gas company that now faces u s sanctions to increase his control and to direct a bigger percentage of its export earnings into government coffers with that money he built popular support by paying for dozens of safety net programs such as the barrio adentro health initiative for the poor and the misión robinson literacy program starting massive infrastructure projects and continuing to subsidize the world s cheapest gasoline when chávez appointed allies to prominent posts at pdvsa in 2002 dissident members of the military and radicalized leaders of the venezuelan federation of chambers of commerce staged a coup attempt that ultimately failed to oust him meanwhile the government invested too little in the oil industry and mismanaged it at the same time it did too little to prepare for the possibility of lower revenue from oil to boost other exports or to stop depending on the united states as its biggest customer following a big decline venezuela remained america s third largest source of foreign oil as of october 2018 maduro s staying power maduro arrived to power in 2013 after the 58 year old chávez died from cancer by then venezuelan oil production had declined and just one year later global oil prices began to collapse maduro s popularity collapsed too although he did get re elected in 2018 in a race without any independent international electoral observers that was marked by boycotts accusations of repressing the opposition and vote rigging on top of his misfortune to be leading venezuela during an oil price slump maduro has turned out to be even worse at managing the oil industry than chávez he installed military cronies as managers led by manuel quevedo a major general in venezuela s national guard since his rise there have been more purges of pdvsa executives and many reports that lower level workers are staying home since they can no longer afford the commute on their wages adding even further to the commotion corruption has run rampant the increased social and economic upheaval has even led many poor people to withdraw their allegiance to maduro amid the turmoil the u s and many other countries are recognizing opposition leader juan guaidó as the nation s legitimate president whether or not guaidó manages to dislodge maduro s grip on power the country s turbulent history suggests that long term success will require much more than removing its current embattled leader any future leaders must also build the coalitions and institutions necessary to break the resource curse and thus empower venezuela to finally draw social and economic stability from its oil wealth scott morgenstern professor of political science university of pittsburgh and john polga hecimovich assistant professor of

by the push is on to turn california into a venezuela style socialist paradise as james carville famously said never let a crisis go unused in this case pg e plus a fire gives san fran the right to start the process of buying the assets of pg e now the drum beat grows louder for the purchase or take over of the utility by government thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe while conversion of pg e to a true publicly held utility with local democratic control would represent a decisive break from california s past the call for public ownership of utility companies has quietly emerged as a national issue advocates across the united states are calling for a reimagining of the widespread corporate public utility model toward more democratic management elected officials staffing utility company boards establishing budgets policies and setting prices and holding regular meetings open to public comment politicians that have run up trillions in debt over one trillion of unfunded pension liabilities run failed government schools losing riders for tax subsidized transportation folks that created a drug crime and housing crisis now want to run your utility in cuba electricity is not on 24 7 you have to run your life and business based on the few hours energy is available that will be california while conversion of pg e to a true publicly held utility with local democratic control would represent a decisive break from california s past the call for public ownership of utility companies has quietly emerged as a national issue advocates across the united states are calling for a reimagining of the widespread corporate public utility model toward more democratic management elected officials staffing utility company boards establishing budgets policies and setting prices and holding regular meetings open to public comment after years of being screwed by pg e california should take public ownership of the floundering utility alexander sammon cnsnews 2 7 19 solutions last week pacific gas electric the beleaguered gas and electric provider for some 16 million residents across the state of california formally filed for bankruptcy protection it s a move that s long been anticipated the investor owned utility company has sustained billions of dollars in losses after a rash of major wildfires exacerbated by climate change damaged transmission lines throughout the state and brought a litany of lawsuits according to court filings the company now has more than 50 billion in liabilities despite being cleared of responsibility for 2017 s tubbs fire then the most destructive wildfire in california history the announcement of the company s pursuit of chapter 11 protection was met with a surprising reaction the company s stock price surged registering one day gains as high as 17 percent resulting in a flurry of coverage in the financial press maybe there s a future not just for this utility wondered chris hill on the motley fool podcast but a future for investing in this utility just one day prior bloomberg businessweek ran an article extolling the virtue of utilities as an investment class noting increased upside due to that very same climate change that has added to pg e s woes a warmer than normal summer last year led to increased air conditioner use boosting earnings the article notes the fate of pg e remains uncertain while the financial sector cozies up to the company the california public utility commission is considering breaking up the regulated monopoly and talks of a bailout linger yet a third option has slowly been gaining popularity among activists in the state public ownership taking pg e out of the hands of investors and turning it over to public control would represent a major transition for the utility sector in california which has seen similar situations before and opted against de privatization in 2001 after the deregulation of the state s energy markets led to a wave of blackouts pg e was forced to file for bankruptcy protection then one of the largest such cases in history that filing resulted in a multibillion dollar bailout courtesy of the state s treasury and reorganization pg e was allowed more or less to return to business as usual while conversion of pg e to a true publicly held utility with local democratic control would represent a decisive break from california s past the call for public ownership of utility companies has quietly emerged as a national issue advocates across the united states are calling for a reimagining of the widespread corporate public utility model toward more democratic management elected officials staffing utility company boards establishing budgets policies and setting prices and holding regular meetings open to public comment in providence rhode island activists have called for the nationalization of electricity provider national grid after protesting proposed rate hikes the providence chapter of the democratic socialists of america launched the nationalizegrid campaign a multi tiered effort aimed at ending utility shutoffs limiting rate increases and establishing democratic control over the primary gas and electricity provider in the state of rhode island we believe wholeheartedly that the state s utility system should not be in private hands and making profits for shareholders says will speck a member of the group and spokesperson for the campaign while the campaigns in rhode island and california may seem fledging they re not without precedent there s already one state in the union that provides electricity to its businesses and residents via community ownership rather than for profit corporations nebraska despite its status as a republican stronghold nebraska has long been a pioneer of the socialization of energy distribution it s home to some 166 different community owned utilities servicing its population of nearly two million and public ownership has not proven to be an expensive luxury public power rates in nebraska are lower than the national average with the cost per kilowatt hour lower than all its neighboring states that s because local not for profit utilities have the power to put their neighbors first reads the nebraska power association website nebraska hasn t always been home to publicly held utilities in the early 20th century more than a third of the state s utilities were owned by private corporations but a wave of laws passed in the new deal era led to the dramatic restructuring of that sector passage of the public utility holding company act and the rural electrification act of the mid 1930s broke up corporate electricity monopolies and provided financing for infrastructure investments by 1949 nebraska had become the first and only all public power state while smaller publicly owned utilities groups have sprung up across the country including the los angeles department of water and power no other state has been able to establish public power on a statewide level the cornhusker state s community owned utilities offer a blueprint for what a publicly owned grid might look like in addition to elected officials staffing utility providers there s also a power review board with five seats appointed by the governor that s tasked with long term planning this has allowed the state to pursue some renewable energy initiatives like the ainsworth wind energy facility one of the nation s largest publicly owned wind farms notably the state does still rely heavily on coal according to advocates of publicly held utilities the threat of climate change and the urgent necessity of conversion to renewable energy means that public ownership of the grid is imperative the biggest reason for the push toward publicly owned utilities is the broader explosion of energy trying to combat climate change especially related to the recent ipcc report says speck referencing the landmark united nations report published last year that warned that sweeping environmental changes would be needed in the next 12 years to keep global temperature increases in check speck notes that the nationalizegrid campaign hopes to go beyond the nebraska model which has been criticized for lagging when it comes to its efforts to curb emissions with the green new deal ascending in popularity and prominence the call to nationalize and democratize energy production and distribution will likely get louder as an important climate policy position that may well appeal to decision makers in california a state that has a reputation for aggressive climate policy and where carbon emissions recently dropped below 1990 levels a full four years ahead of the state s own legal requirement recently sworn in governor gavin newsom has yet to give any indication that public ownership of pg e is being seriously considered but the company s bankruptcy filing does allow the opportunity for the state to lead on a nationwide issue it may well be a necessary step in advancing california s environmental agenda which as of september included a law requiring that 100 percent of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2045 alexander sammon is a reporter researcher at

financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap rewalk believes that the

with gaap for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 non gaap net loss is calculated as gaap net loss excluding i non cash share based compensation expense ii depreciation and iii

believes that providing non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash share based compensation expense depreciation and non cash financial income expenses allows for more meaningful comparisons between operating results from period to period each of the company s non gaap financial measures is an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for the company s evaluation of its operating results over different periods of time the non gaap financial data are not measures of the company s financial performance under u s gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to operating loss or net loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap non gaap financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in rewalk s industry as other companies in the industry may calculate non gaap financial results differently particularly related to non recurring unusual items in addition there are limitations in using non gaap financial measures because the non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on the company s reported financial results further share based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the company s business and an important part of the compensation provided to its employees the presentation of non gaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap rewalk urges investors to review the reconciliation of the company s non

materially we direct you to our earnings release slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website and our most recent form 10 k and form 10 q filed with the securities and exchange commission for a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations i will now turn the call over to david emery for a few comments please make sure you ve selected a ticker david emery executive chairman thanks jerome good morning everyone we appreciate your attendance on the call today as most of you are likely aware lin evans succeeded me as ceo effective january 1 and i m going to continue to serve as executive chairman of the board until may 1 2020 which follows the expiration of my current three year board term in light of that ceo succession this will be my last earnings call and today i plan to just make a few introductory comments and then i ll turn it over to lin evans and rich kinzle to review results and answer all your questions 2018 was a transformational year for black hills we made great progress on a number of key strategic initiatives during the year that positions us extremely well for future success as we focus on the customer and growth as an electric and gas utility lin and rich will provide the details for the year but i think a few of our achievements deserves special mention we completed our exited oil and gas business during the year that s our final business that was not directly related to our utilities we developed and disclosed comprehensive long term capital investment plans for both our electric and natural gas utilities those will ensure our ability to serve customers safely reliably and affordably and also provide our shareholders with earnings growth that is well above industry average for years to come we continued our track record now of 49 consecutive annual dividend increases for shareholders which is now the second longest streak in the utility industry we delivered solid financial results even exceeding the top end of our earnings guidance range thanks to a little help from weather in the fourth quarter and we had the most successful regulatory year in the company s history under the guidance of our regulatory team our employees completed three different rate reviews received approval to return the benefits of the tax cuts and jobs act to our customers in six states we extended a critical integrity rider in nebraska settled a multiyear power cost adjustment dispute in wyoming followed an filed an electric resource plan in wyoming we filed for approval of innovative renewable energy tariffs in wyoming and south dakota and block chain and data center tariffs in wyoming and colorado and we made significant progress toward combining our multiple gas distribution utilities in three states colorado wyoming and nebraska all of those achievements set us up really well for success in 2019 and beyond i want to personally thank each member of our employee team for a really successful 2018 their efforts are greatly appreciated the future of the company is extremely bright we ve got an excellent strategic plan to better serve our customers and communities while providing our shareholders with strong total shareholder returns our leadership and employee team which i believe is among the best in the industry is well positioned to successfully execute that strategy and finally to wrap up i want to thank all of you in the investment community that i ve had the pleasure to work with over the last 15 years as ceo i wish you all the best and with that i ll turn it over to lin and rich lin evans president and chief executive officer thank you dave good morning everybody please let me take this opportunity to once again recognize and congratulate dave on his retirement after more than 29 years of service with our company and served our employees and our customers and our shareholders very well david has done an extraordinary job in my opinion leading creating and growing the company that we know today and i am enjoying and valuing my relationship with dave as our executive chairman of the board and we continue to wish david and diana a great happiness as they enter their next chapter of their life together i ll be starting on slide 3 of our presentation i ll cover the highlights of the quarter rich will then provide his financial update and then i ll finish with the discussion around our strategy before i cover highlights on slide 5 i too would like to take a moment to recognize the 2018 achievements that are represented within the materials that we re going to present this morning these achievements are certainly not possible without our investors both large and small investors they entrust us with their savings and we thank them for that without the broad access to cost effective capital from our investors we would not be able to make the necessary investments that we do to provide safe and reliable energy to our customers we are laser focused on delivering for our customers and our investors this year and we re also prepared for 2020 and beyond also at black hills we take safety very seriously and it continues to be top of mind with an enhanced commitment in everything that we do we set an all time record in 2018 with the fewest number of employee injuries from boots on the ground to safety in the office every meeting and every job we do starts with what we call a safety share or a safety tailboard in the field all potential hazards are discussed before the job begins and necessary precautions are taken to protect employees and our communities a sustained and strengthened safety culture requires persistent daily attention in everything that we do and i assure you that all of us at black hills take that very seriously we had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2018 operationally financially and strategically our entire black hills team continued to execute our electric and natural gas utility strategy and have shelled through a variety of successes across the organization operationally we delivered excellent performance being ready to deliver reliable service during all time peak weather demands enabling strong financial results financially we reported earnings above our guidance range mainly related to weather benefits compared to normal weather of 0 06 per share for the quarter and 0 09 per share for the full year strategically we planned for and executed a comprehensive regulatory agenda and i am proud of how the organization responded we further demonstrated our customer focus in 2018 laying the groundwork for upgrading and modernizing our utility infrastructure systems while we continue to transform the customer experience and then to cap off our achievements for the year we did celebrate our 135th anniversary of serving customers we ve come a long way from our origins when we introduced electric lights to the western frontier back in 1883 now moving to slide 5 and our highlights for our electric utilities on december 17 we requested approval for our voluntary renewable energy tariffs in south dakota and wyoming and i plan to provide additional details about this later in the presentation on november 30 we filed our integrated resource plan in wyoming we are recommending that we serve customers through a balanced mix of generation resources that will include coal natural gas and renewables a balanced mix of generation assets will allow us to deliver reliable and affordable energy to customers while adding renewable energy resources as it make sense for our customers and shareholders importantly the resource plan also notes that the wygen 1 power plant is the most economic resource to meet our near term capacity shortfall under all modeling scenarios in october wyoming electric received approval from the wyoming public service commission for a multiyear multi docket settlement to resolve issues related to our power cost adjustment now importantly the settlement provides us clarity for the wygen 1 power purchase agreement through 2022 and rich will provide details around the customer credits related to this settlement in his financial update turning to slide 6 last summer both colorado electric and wyoming electric set new all time peak loads then in the fourth quarter both of our colorado electric and wyoming electric utilities set new record winter peak loads indicating ongoing load growth in those jurisdictions gas utility highlights on slide 6 now in february 1 2019 colorado gas filed a rate review proposal with the colorado commission to consolidate the rates the tariffs and the services of our two legacy gas utilities in colorado this is another step in our jurisdiction simplification you may recall that in 2018 we filed a request with the colorado commission to approve the legal consolidation of our two legacy utilities into a single new company we received approval for that consolidation last october and then we completed the consolidation in excuse me in december our colorado gas rate review filing also requests a new rider mechanism to recover integrity investments that we have identified within colorado in november our gas utilities received approval from the wyoming commission to construct the 54 million natural bridge pipeline to improve safe supply diversity and delivery capacity for our customers in central wyoming and we expect this pipeline to be in service in late 2019 in october we received approval in arkansas for our first rate review since acquiring gas utility operations in the state new rates were implemented in mid october to recover more than 160 million of utility infrastructure investments as we support the robust economic growth being experienced in the northwest arkansas and in support of our continued safety and reliability investments on behalf of our customers now moving to slide 7 in december our power generation segment acquired a 50 interest in the busch ranch 1 wind farm in colorado which provides renewable energy to our colorado electric utility under a power purchase agreement that agreement expires in 2037 our colorado electric utility owns the other 50 interest in busch ranch 1 and also operates the entire facility on january 30 our board declared a quarterly dividend of 50 and a half cents per share which represents an annualized rate of 2 02 in 2019 and is our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase one of the longest track records in the utility industry and a record we are proud of and we are determined to continue last november we increased the dividend by 6 3 moving to slide 8 as noted earlier david retired as ceo effective december 31 he has continued to serve as executive chairman until may of 2020 when his current board term will expire i m both humbled and excited to lead black hills as we focus on our natural gas and electric utility strategy as we deliver benefits to customers and shareholders now shifting back to the quarter we completed the conversion of our equity units on november first we issued 6 37 million shares of new common stock this milestone completed the financing related to the very successful acquisition of source gas back in february of 2016 slides 9 and 10 illustrate our excellent fourth quarter and full year earnings driven by strong results in our gas utilities the gas utilities benefited from new rates associated with three completed rate reviews return on new infrastructure investments residential growth increased usage per customer and colder weather you can find the full year highlights and more details on specific items in our earnings release which we distributed last night now i ll turn it over to rich for his financial update rich rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer very good thank you lin and good morning everyone as lin noted we enjoyed strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018 i ll start on slide 12 where we reconciled gaap earnings to earnings from continuing operations as adjusted a non gaap measure we do this to isolate special items and communicate earnings that better represent our ongoing performance this slide displays the last five quarters and full years 2017 and 2018 working from top to bottom on the slide the first special item is related to onetime acquisition costs incurred as part of the source gas integration which wrapped up in 2017 the second item relates primarily to tax reform at the end of 2017 we recorded a benefit related to tax reform in 2018 certain benefits and expenses associated with the new law netted to 0 07 of expense for the full year the tax reform items this year related to our continued evaluation of the impact of the new law on our financial statements as well as impacts from continued revisions and irs guidance regarding the new law the largest special item you see is related to the tax benefit of legal restructurings completed in 2018 as part of an effort to simplify our legal organization in q1 and q4 we restructured certain entities acquired as part of the source gas acquisition the restructurings increased goodwill that is amortizable for tax purposes resulting in a 49 million deferred tax benefit in the first quarter and a 23 million deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter for a total of 1 31 per share for the full year the special items on this page are not indicative of an ongoing performance and accordingly we reflected them on as adjusted basis as adjusted eps for the fourth quarter grew 7 to 1 05 per share compared to 0 98 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year as adjusted eps increased 5 in 2018 to 3 54 per share compared to 3 36 per share in 2017 this growth was driven mainly by strong performance at our gas utilities as lin noted earlier we benefited from colder than normal weather across our service territories in 2018 and we estimate that 0 06 of eps in the fourth quarter and 0 09 of eps for the full year resulted from favorable weather compared to normal backing the 0 06 of favorability in the fourth quarter off the 3 54 our eps would have been 3 48 which is within the high end of the guidance range of 3 35 to 3 50 that we issued in early november the waterfall chart on slide 13 illustrates major drivers bridging net income from q4 2017 to q4 2018 all amounts on this chart are net of income tax you ll note we had a revenue reduction in 2018 as a result of passing tax reform benefits on to our utility customers these revenue reductions are offset by reduced income tax outside the tax reform the biggest item of note is that our gas utilities gross margin for the fourth quarter demonstrated substantial improvement driving our 13 increase in as adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter last year i ll detail segment performance shortly the waterfall chart on slide 14 illustrates major drivers bridging net income for full year 2017 into full year 2018 as with the fourth quarter chart all amounts in this chart are net of income taxes again we had a revenue reduction in 2018 as a result of passing tax reform benefits on to our utility customers which is offset by reduced taxes and strong margin improvement at the gas utilities drove our 6 increase in as adjusted net income slide 15 displays our fourth quarter and full year income statements comparing 2018 to 2017 we delivered growth in income from continuing operations as adjusted from both the fourth quarter and the full year operating income and ebitda decreased in 2018 mainly due to the reductions in revenue and gross margin from delivering approximately 43 million of tax reform benefits to our utility customers again this reduction in revenue gross margin is offset by reduced income taxes so the effect on the bottom line is neutral operating expenses increased by over 5 year over year however 2018 operating expenses included a few nonrecurring items such as the 30 day wygen 1 major outage which included a million 1 3 million of o m and bad debt was 2 1 million higher in 2018 due to increased revenue recognized backing these amounts out of 2018 operating expenses yields an approximately 4 normalized increase in operating expenses year over year we did make targeted o m investments during 2018 by hiring additional people in our higher growth areas like arkansas and in areas such as gas engineering and regulatory to support our customer focused capital program looking ahead we expect o m escalation to be near inflationary we remain committed to our long term objective of improving efficiencies for our customers also of note is that during 2018 we recognized approximately 69 million in onetime reductions of income tax expense related primarily to the legal restructurings i mentioned previously excluding those onetime net benefits in our tax expense line our effective tax rate would ve been 17 6 for the full year which is about what we would have expected income from continuing operations as adjusted increased 6 from 185 3 million in 2017 to 196 5 million in 2018 you will note our diluted share count increased year over year on november first 2018 we issued 6 37 million common shares upon conversion of unit mandatory securities issued in late 2015 to help fund the source gas acquisition this brought our year end actual diluted share count to just under 60 million shares overall we re pleased with the earnings per share growth from 3 36 to 3 54 slide 16 displays our electric utilities gross margin and operating income the electric utilities gross margin was relatively flat for the fourth quarter and full year compared to 2017 predominantly driven by increases from shared facility revenue returns on transmission investments and favorable weather offset by lower revenue due to tax reform the shared facility revenue is new in 2018 and is reflective of south dakota electric owning our new corporate headquarters and receiving rent from all our subsidiaries this amounted to 9 8 million in 2018 over 2017 this compares in difference and our segment information will go away in 2019 another notable gross margin item relates to the 7 million wyoming pca settlement we reached in october we recorded a 1 7 million reserve associated with this issue in 2017 and another 4 3 million in 2018 so we have 6 million of the 7 million settlement recorded through year end 2018 with 500 000 to be expensed in each 2019 and 2020 per the terms of the settlement other gross margin changes for the quarter and year over year are detailed in our press release yesterday operating expenses were 4 6 million higher in the fourth quarter and 19 2 million for the full year as a result of increase expenses associated with vegetation management shared facility ramp and depreciation operating income decreased by approximately 22 million for full year 2018 compared to 2017 again this decrease in operating income is attributed to delivering approximately 22 million in tax reform benefits to our customers which is offset by lower income tax moving to slide 17 from an operating income perspective our gas utilities were flat year over year which is remarkable given the effective tax reform on operating income gross margin increased by 25 million despite delivering approximately 21 million of tax reform benefits to customers the year over year margin increase was the result of new rates from three completed rate reviews return on new infrastructure investments residential customer growth increased usage per customer and favorable weather operating expenses were approximately 25 million higher year over year offsetting the increase in gross margin operating expenses increased as a result of higher employee and contract related costs associated with growth in our service territories higher facility costs higher uncollectible accounts and increased from increased revenue and higher depreciation expense again achieving flat operating income at our gas utilities year over year is quite remarkable given the effective tax reform as you saw back on slide 10 on an as adjusted basis the gas utilities increased their contribution to earnings by nearly 18 million comparing 2018 to 2017 next i ll talk about gross margin impact from weather at both our electric and gas utilities when compared to normal as opposed to comparing to last year in the fourth quarter compared to normal weather favorability impacted our gas utilities gross margin by an estimated 4 1 million and our electric utilities gross margin by approximately 400 000 for the full year compared to normal weather favorability impacted our gas utilities gross margin by an estimated 4 6 million and our electric utility gross margins by an estimated 1 8 million on slide 18 you see that power generation operating income decreased 3 2 million for the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased by 4 1 million year over year primarily driven by a planned major turbine outage on wygen 1 that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 this scheduled outage reduced revenue by 2 9 million year over year and increased o m by approximately 1 3 million year over year outside of that outage the power generation segment continued to realize strong contract availability from its generating units and continued its strong cash flow contributions on slide 19 in the fourth quarter of 2018 our mining segment had an 800 000 operating income increase compared to the fourth quarter in 2017 for the quarter revenue declined 900 000 with unfavorable tons sold primarily driven by the wygen 1 outage this revenue decrease was more than offset by decreased maintenance and overburden removal costs compared to the prior year for the full year 2018 mining operating income increased by 2 8 million revenue was 1 4 million higher for the full year with the benefit of increased pricing partially offset by lower tons sold compared to full year 2017 on the cost side we had decreased costs of 1 4 million primarily driven by lower maintenance and mining costs in 2018 the mine continues to perform at a high level and sales almost entirely to on site and mine mouth plants with roughly half our sales based on a cost plus pricing methodology slide 20 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure credit ratings and financial flexibility our credit ratings are strong at bbb plus at both fitch and s p and baa2 at moody s we remain committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings at the end of 2018 our debt to total capitalization ratio of 58 9 was a 710 basis point improvement from year end 2017 we met our commitment to improve our capital structure after the acquisition of source gas and reduced our debt to cap ratio below 60 by the end of 2018 this improvement was in large part driven by the final settlement of our equity units and the resulting conversion of the unit mandatories to common equity on november first we used the proceeds received from the settlement to pay off the 250 million notes due january of 2019 and reduce short term debt we continue to target a debt to total capitalization ratio in the mid 50s over the long term looking to the future we have strong and stable cash flows from our businesses a very manageable debt maturity schedule and access to liquidity through our revolver and at the market equity program providing us plenty of flexibility to fund our strong capital expenditure program slide 21 illustrates our dividend track record we ve grown the dividend at a faster rate the past few years demonstrating our confidence in our future earnings growth potential as we ve stated in the past our intent is to not reduce the amount of the annual dividend increase and we maintain our dividend payout ratio policy of 50 to 60 of earnings on slide 22 we re reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2019 with a range of 3 35 to 3 55 per share and for 2020 with a range of 3 50 to 3 80 per share as i noted on our third quarter call back in november we don t intend to make two years of guidance our regular practice but providing this preliminary 2020 guidance to demonstrate confidence in our customer focused growth strategy which includes substantial capital expenditures to support the growth and maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our utility systems the major assumptions relied upon to formulate the earnings guidance for both 2019 and 2020 are noted on slides 59 and 60 in the appendix our capex disclosure has once again increased this quarter primarily due to the addition of the corriedale wind project in total 2018 through 2020 capex increased by 90 million from our previous disclosure in november we ve continued to assume annual equity issuances through our at the market equity program of 25 to 50 million in both 2019 and 2020 to help fund their capex program with that i m going to turn it back to lin to talk about our strategy lin evans president and chief executive officer thank you rich i ll be continuing on slide 24 which sets forth our strategic objectives update consistent with past several years we grouped our strategic goals into four major categories profitable growth valued service better every day and great workplace our overall objective is to perform as a best in class utility in everything that we do with the strategic divestiture of our final non utility supporting business the entire black hills team continues to be tightly aligned as we execute our customer focused utility strategy on slide 25 we have completed the process of transitioning our earnings growth drivers from an acquisition and integration focus to a more traditional customer focused utility growth strategy from a strategy execution perspective we are focused on delivering long term shareholder value returns driven by our customer focused capital investment program our continued focus on standardization and efficiency improvements across the entire organization more regular rate review filings as we return to a more traditional utility model and achieving greater burner tip saturation in our gas utilities and adding load in our electric utilities additionally we target a dividend payout ratio of 50 to 60 our team is determined to continue our track record of 49 consecutive annual dividend increases moving to slide 26 this slide illustrates the diversity between our electric and gas utilities for complementary seasonality and the broad customer locations we serve in stable and growing states this diversity reduces business risk and delivers earnings that are more predictable risk from any particular region or business are diminished in light of the total company scale as illustrated on slide 27 our strategic utility acquisitions over the years have created greater investment opportunities for our larger transmission and distribution systems and expanded customer base these larger systems across eight states provide more diverse opportunities for investments more interconnections for reliability and growth and greater overall efficiency of operations on slide 28 our larger systems require significant long term investments to meet our customers needs we anticipate significant ongoing capital investment requirements focused on safety and reliability and supporting customer growth these forecasted levels of investment needs far exceed forecasted appreciation which will translate to earnings growth as we ve noted on prior calls we normally add capital to the outer years as those gears get closer and as we gain more comfort around specific projects our total five year forecast of capital expenditures of more than 2 5 billion has potential for incremental opportunities which we are still evaluating with the build out of our programmatic infrastructure replacement plans combined with growth in larger project opportunities we fully expect our actual capital expenditures will be greater we updated our capital investment plan again this quarter by adding our current 2023 capital investment forecast as a reminder we added 208 million to the capital investment plan last quarter our current capital forecast now includes a couple of larger projects including the natural bridge pipeline near casper wyoming and the busch ranch 2 wind farm currently under construction in colorado this capital forecast also includes some initial capital for me in the proposed pens mega rule as it s sometimes referred to i want to have one more comment around capital investment and earnings growth we believe our base investment forecast will translate to earnings growth rates above the utility industry average as we consider other growth objectives that have meters and have load and as larger customer focused capital investment projects that we don t currently have in the forecast start to come to fruition we will then add to our base forecast then we should achieve even higher earnings growth rates slide 29 illustrates the background of our five year capital forecast excuse me the breakdown our 90 of our forecasted investment is in our utilities those utility investments over 70 are recovered in an accelerated manner moving to slide 30 now this slide provides detail on forecasted capital investment for our gas utilities including breakouts by state by investment type and by recovery mechanism the forecast includes the addition of the natural bridge pipeline project this year as well slide 31 illustrates our base expectations around our long term recurring capital outlook at our gas utilities of at least 225 to 250 million annually related primarily to programmatic safety investment for both gas distribution and gas transmission as we note on the slide and as i stated on slide 28 larger pipeline and storage product will be incremental to this base expectation slide 32 provides detail on forecasted capital investment for our electric utilities as noted before we ve added 57 million for the corridale wind project across 2019 and 2020 slide 33 illustrates our current expectation of 120 million to 140 million of annual base investment in our electric utilities 80 of which to ensure a safe and reliable system large generation renewable and transmission projects will be incremental through this recurring annual expectation with our natural gas electric utilities combined our current expectation for annual recurring base investment is 345 million to 390 million plus incremental large projects across both utilities again as we enhance our customer investment programs and continue to grow we expect our gas and electric utility capital forecast will increase as we grow to as we continue to evaluate our system moving to slide 34 as i noted earlier black hills planned and executed extremely well a comprehensive regulatory agenda in 2018 we successfully completed three rate reviews including our first at arkansas gas we provided tax reform benefits to customers in six states we prepared and filed an electric resource plan in wyoming we received approval for the natural bridge pipeline also in wyoming we requested approval for the corridale wind energy project we also commenced proceedings in colorado to consolidate two gas utilities within the state we completed that legal consolidation in december and we recently filed a rate review application to consolidate the rates the tariffs and the services from our two legacy gas utilities the table also shows the ongoing tax reform effort in wyoming and we expect to receive approval in the first half of 2019 to date we have returned approximately 43 million of benefits to customers related to the tax cuts and jobs act moving to slide 35 this slide shows a timeline around our multistate jurisdiction simplification efforts we have three states in which we own multiple gas distribution utilities colorado nebraska and wyoming we strongly believe consolidation of the multiple entities within each of these states will provide long lasting benefits for all of our stakeholders including our regulators through streamlined and fewer regulatory proceedings and filings consolidation will also simplify the customer billing process and improve how we deliver customer service through fewer tariffs to manage having fewer jurisdiction entities will reduce our risk and also reduce both the complexity and the quantity of rate reviews regulatory filings and other reporting requirements we also make corporate processes simpler and in some cases it provided onetime tax benefits wyoming electric will likely file a legal consolidation request in the first quarter of 2019 and if approved we will file a consolidated rate review later in 2019 nebraska will most likely file a legal consolidation request in the first half of 2019 prior to our current plan and to file a rate review likely 2020 moving now to slide 36 to support our renewable ready program as we call it we submitted request for approval of tariffs to both south dakota and the wyoming commissions this tariff and program if it s approved will provide government and larger commercial and industrial customers a cost effective option to purchase utility scale renewable energy up to 100 of their needs so far we have received strong interest from potential customers got renewable energy this program is basically a subscription program that offers customers contracts and duration of five years and up to 25 years if we continue to experience sufficient interest the program would essentially fund the rate base investment required to provide renewable energy and this program is designed to keep these larger customers on our electric utilities systems while protecting remaining customers from the potential loss of load slide 37 on this slide we focus every day on operational excellence our safety performance continues to be excellent and our reliability for 2018 was outstanding even though we did not quite achieve our internal safety goal this year we delivered a record year respect to the fewest number of our employee injuries all three electric utilities achieved reliability in the top quartile of all electric utilities in the country we also received employee recognition in south dakota and in nebraska for their safety and their community service slide 38 contains our 2018 scorecard and this will be our final review of how we did for this last year with many successes across the board all in all i feel very good about our accomplishments in 2018 now slide 29 introduces our 2019 scorecards listing a number of priorities across our organization the scorecard includes a number of key objectives including executing on our capital program and completing construction of three major projects the natural bridge pipeline the busch ranch 2 wind farm and the rapid city to stigo transmission line in conclusion 2018 was a very eventful and productive year for black hills and i m very proud of our accomplishments and the performance of the entire black hills team we re really excited about 2019 as we execute on our natural gas and electric utility strategy we will continue to transform the customer experience we will remain laser focused on delivering results for shareholders and we will continue our journey to become the safest utility in the industry this concludes my and rich s remarks and we re happy to take questions please questions and answers operator our first question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning congratulations lin evans president and chief executive officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst and all the best to david yeah so perhaps just to kick things off at a high level you talked strategy you talked about being above average among the utilities can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think about that just is that under using the current forecast and through what period are you thinking sorry to ask you for a little more detail here but i just want to get a little bit clear on how you re thinking about it lin evans president and chief executive officer we see that julien for the next through 2023 we have strong capital spending as we said earlier and we said before in meetings like this as we get closer to those years we routinely find projects that we are working on as we find we re working on projects as they come to fruition then we begin to add them to the capital and so we see i see strong spreading through 2023 as we put into this presentation this quarter and we also see that ongoing rate spending of up to 390 million of being something that we re going to continue to do so we serve territories that are growing we serve territories now with especially up to the source gas transaction and we have opportunities to enhance our customer reliability enhance our system for customer reliability and continue to improve safety within our territory so we see above industry average growth in the near term and in the midterm as well at least through 2023 julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent so let me get a little bit more the details there if you can obviously a nice quarter over quarter increase again in the capex just wanted to make sure i know what s in and more importantly what s out of the capex still as it stands today i think you said several times the natural bridge program busch ranch etc are in the capex program but outside of it i think you said the tariff program in south dakota and wyoming still excluded what else is outside of it and how do you think about a the timeline to getting that into the capex program and b at least specific to the tariff program the magnitude of the capital rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer julien it s rich the corridale project which supports renewable ready is in the capex that s one of the additions we made so that s 57 million in the addition you saw julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok all right excellent now are there other products that are excluded i know that sort of the quarter over quarter increases that we ve seen it seems like it s largely reflective of this point in time but is there anything else with respect to the capital program that you just discussed that are excluded rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve got a lot of projects that we ve identified that we re working on again we typically don t add them to this capex until either we file the cpcn or otherwise advance the project to a point where we re comfortable adding it but i think the point that lin was making earlier and that i ll reiterate is it s very likely that you will see that forward capex schedule continue to increase as we get to smooth from up around the different projects we re looking at julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent rich one quick follow up there on 18 very nicely done i want to just clarify here obviously there s a good chunk of weather there year over year as you roll into 19 here any favorable tailwinds that we should be paying attention to that have materialized to get you above 2018 here just to make sure we re not missing anything rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer if you re referring to weather we re in the process of closing our january books and so nothing to share there but i will say it was warm to start the year for the first couple weeks and then as you know the latter half of january has been pretty cold so at this point kind of averaging that out i d characterize it as normal nothing s materialized that would make us change the assumptions that we ve put in our guidance and that s why we reaffirmed it julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it but nothing outside of weather that you d be flagging or just that drove the beat on 18 to pay attention to in the 19 rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer nope julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok all right excellent well thank you all very much rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you julien operator our next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse your line is now open michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys how are you doing lin evans president and chief executive officer great michael good morning how are you michael weinstein credit suisse analyst great so on the renewable ready program how big can that program get and what are you thinking about in terms of future growth for it and does it become a material driver of capex at some point you know lin evans president and chief executive officer it s a good question it s early in the process michael so i wouldn t analyze it we ve been approaching our top when i say our largest customers especially in south dakota and wyoming with this concept we started talking to them several months ago and i d say we were a little bit on the surprised side how interested those customers were and they have expressed strong interest frankly in fact when we filed the tariffs we asked the customers who had high interest to sign kind of letters of intent if you will to establish with our regulators that there is interest in this kind of a program and we ve kind of just scratched the surface we plan to talk the tariffs propose that our top 600 customers would be eligible for the tariff and we re working our way down the list so we will see i m pretty excited about it personally i believe that we may have opportunity beyond this project but we have a ways to go to determine that michael weinstein credit suisse analyst ok and with the emphasis on consolidation at the utilities colorado and wyoming coming up i know you said that the m a is a or acquisitions at least from a strategy point of view has been deemphasized and that continues to be the case now in 2019 but what about divestitures which is another that you specifically mentioned that is not included in the guidance but is there any additional consolidation through divestitures that might to be being considered or would be considered going forward lin evans president and chief executive officer michael i think the short answer to that is no we like the territories that we re in they re growing territories and we re in the utilities business and we re going to appreciate those that we have so the short answer is no michael weinstein credit suisse analyst and one final question about wire duct and pacific core i don t know if you ve gotten any kind of indication from them as to whether they intend to go extend their life of that plant beyond 2022 and if they did decide not to and the contract for coal with pacificorp was ended at that point what would be the impact on net income lin evans president and chief executive officer good question we ve been watching their irps closely and of course having conversations with pacific core and frankly we re in negotiations with them now as we reopen the coal contract for pricing if you ll note in there april as i recall 2017 irp they show why that plant is being a very low cost resource and operating it through to 2039 and then they re making their 2019 irp presentations now and those presentations continue to show the benefits of continuing to operate the wire duct plant now the other half of your so we don t we believe they will continue to operate it the other side of your question what if they were to close it well we ll cross that bridge when we get to it but we do have cost plus contracts at the mine for our remaining plants and we would certainly rightsize the mine and operate it as efficiently as we could from that perspective going forward michael weinstein credit suisse analyst so there would be a path to mitigate any earnings impact essentially from shutting parts of the plant part of the mine lin evans president and chief executive officer we think so mike yeah michael weinstein credit suisse analyst ok ok great all right thank you very much appreciate it operator with no further questions i will return the call back to lin evans for closing remarks go ahead sir lin evans president and chief executive officer thank you everyone for your interest in black hills i ll take this opportunity to once again thank our employee team for an outstanding 2018 and ask for their continued focus on 2019 as we execute our strategy and thank you for your interest in black hills and have a great day thank you operator duration 51 minutes call participants jerome

washington ap a new report from the white house tries to shift the trump administration s combative rhetoric on health care suggesting changes to the affordable care act under president donald trump do not fundamentally undermine the health law the council of economic advisers report released friday says obama era subsidies that help low and middle income customers pay their premiums will help keep healthcare gov afloat even if some healthy people drop out or seek other coverage because of trump s changes nearly 90 percent of customers get taxpayer provided assistance the report reflects the outcome of 2018 midterm elections in which democrats successfully campaigned on keeping the aca and effectively ended trump s drive to repeal it democratic 2020 white house hopefuls are seizing on health care as an issue with some pushing for a government run system that would cover all americans and replace the aca better known as obamacare the council is a white house agency that advises the president larry levitt of the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation said it suggests to him the administration is trying to move on from the battle over the aca which trump and republicans in congress failed to repeal the president seemed to take pride in undermining the aca but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law levitt said they can point to benefits of deregulation but will also have to live with the costs which include higher premiums for middle class people with pre existing conditions the aca has risen in popularity with the public the report looks at three big changes under trump that affect former president barack obama s health care law they are congressional repeal of the law s unpopular fines on people who go uninsured association health plans for small businesses and low cost short term health insurance that doesn t have to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs these reforms do not sabotage the aca but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax funded care to those in need says the report casting the administration s changes as de regulation it comes as house democrats under speaker nancy pelosi d calif are moving to shore up the aca including trying to undo some of trump s insurance changes although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre existing conditions restoring the ad budget for healthcare gov slashed by trump is also a possibility about 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the aca s subsidized markets or exchanges and another 12 million are covered by its medicaid expansion casey mulligan chief economist for the white house council said it turns out that the health law s penalty for people going uninsured wasn t really essential for the program to function he said the subsidies were more important removing the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars give families more choice without destabilizing the exchanges he said the report didn t address constitutional arguments in a texas court case against the aca brought by red state officials but its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case the plaintiffs contend that the whole law was made unconstitutional by congressional repeal of the fines on the uninsured a federal district court judge agreed and that ruling is on appeal the justice department has said in connection with the case that it will no longer defend the law s protections for people with pre existing conditions now the white house report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law officials at the council of economic advisers said they re not policymakers or lawyers but economists the report also claims 450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies and the cancelled fines but it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle and upper income consumers kaiser foundation analyst levitt said 450 billion seems high to him
while large numbers defy comprehension americans should try to wrap their minds around the huge sums of money owed on the fastest growing segment of the federal budget the interest expense on the national debt will hit the 1 trillion mark in a decade then become a consistent 1 trillion outlay each year while economists generally track spending revenues and deficits as a share of gross domestic output there is something to be said about the sheer magnitude of an annual interest cost of 1 trillion and the profound effect that a bill of that size would have on the budget millions billions and trillions may be phonetically similar but they have vastly different magnitudes a million is certainly large but a trillion is a million times a million while a 5 7 billion disagreement on a wall may have shut down the government for more than a month budget debates having a 1 trillion interest expense at their core enough to fund a wall long enough to wrap around the world twice will be substantially worse mosads the interest expense on the national debt is for the most part payments owed on outstanding borrowings and not all that unlike the interest charge many of us see on monthly credit card statements it is tolerable if the purchases were worthwhile perhaps for investing rather than for consuming fortunately the federal government enjoys a much better credit rating than the rest of us and it pays a much lower interest rate while federal spending for social security and medicare are frequently and accurately cited as the major drivers of the unenviable budgetary outlook for the country the congressional budget office estimates that net interest will increase at a substantially faster pace than entitlements interest payments are forecast to double from 325 billion last year to 650 billion in about five years this is a course that will have the united states spending more money on interest than national defense by 2025 americans should not be surprised by the magnitude of this interest cost because the federal government has for many years followed a deliberate policy of spending more money than it collects thereby requiring heavy borrowing in good times and bad even now with low unemployment and interest rates high asset values and an expanding economy the united states finds itself in a 1 trillion budget deficit pattern with little political will to alter a design where spending growth steadily outpaces revenues the national debt is the accumulation of many years of operating in the red it is close to 22 trillion and will continue to rise along with interest due congress occasionally debates debt levels and imposes a limit but that is an ineffectual gesture because borrowing needs are driven by past budgetary decisions rather than the imposition of an after the fact debt ceiling which is now suspended but slated to be reimposed next month notwithstanding attention in policy and academic circles regarding the economic and fiscal impacts of government debt borrowing is never free it costs households and it costs the government borrowing only makes sense if you think you will have more money in the future unfortunately recent tax changes weaken the ability of the united states to repay its debts because less money will be available in the future tax cuts might better be described as tax deferrals citizens will pay down the road or perhaps more likely our children and our grandchildren will foot the bill economists and fiscal policy analysts have differing opinions regarding how much debt is sustainable the traditional argument against incurring large amounts of debt has been that public borrowing crowds out other uses for investable resources reduces national savings and increases upward pressure on interest rates as borrowers compete for increasingly scarce resources debt however can be a valuable fiscal tool if it is used prudently such as for investment or to support countercyclical stimulus regardless a significant portion of the federal debt cake is already baked interest payments will be high for the foreseeable future perhaps the best that policymakers can reasonably do at this point is to ensure the situation does not get dramatically worse while the economy is strong new efforts should be made to stabilize the primary deficit which excludes interest payments to lessen the structural budgetary imbalance that exists if not interest payments will consume an ever increasing share of the wealth in the united states and it is sure to negatively impact future generations if the united states was not stuck with such a huge interest bill the funds could be used in countless ways or taxes could be cut by thousands of dollars for every american household but first the country must pay this interest expense which is not exactly the kind of public spending that generates enthusiasm among citizens who would prefer to pay taxes in exchange for federal programs designed to protect and care for them both now and in the future not so much for services done in the past douglas criscitello is a senior lecturer and executive director of the golub center for finance and policy at the

earnings call and today i plan to just make a few introductory comments and then i ll turn it over to lin evans and rich kinzle to review results and answer all your questions 2018 was a transformational year for black hills advertisement advertisement we made great progress on a number of key strategic initiatives during the year that positions us extremely well for future success as we focus on the customer and growth as an electric and gas utility lin and rich will provide the details for the year but i think a few of our achievements deserves special mention we completed our exited oil and gas business during the year that s our final business that was not directly related to our utilities we developed and disclosed comprehensive long term capital investment plans for both our electric and natural gas utilities those will ensure our ability to serve customers safely reliably and affordably and also provide our shareholders with earnings growth that is well above industry average for years to come we continued our track record now of 49 consecutive annual dividend increases for shareholders which is now the second longest streak in the utility industry we delivered solid financial results even exceeding the top end of our earnings guidance range thanks to a little help from weather in the fourth quarter and we had the most successful regulatory year in the company s history under the guidance of our regulatory team our employees completed three different rate reviews received approval to return the benefits of the tax cuts and jobs act to our customers in six states we extended a critical integrity rider in nebraska settled a multiyear power cost adjustment dispute in wyoming followed an filed an electric resource plan in wyoming we filed for approval of innovative renewable energy tariffs in wyoming and south dakota and block chain and data center tariffs in wyoming and colorado and we made significant progress toward combining our multiple gas distribution utilities in three states colorado wyoming and nebraska all of those achievements set us up really well for success in 2019 and beyond i want to personally thank each member of our employee team for a really successful 2018 their efforts are greatly appreciated the future of the company is extremely bright we ve got an excellent strategic plan to better serve our customers and communities while providing our shareholders with strong total shareholder returns advertisement advertisement our leadership and employee team which i believe is among the best in the industry is well positioned to successfully execute that strategy and finally to wrap up i want to thank all of you in the investment community that i ve had the pleasure to work with over the last 15 years as ceo i wish you all the best and with that i ll turn it over to lin and rich lin evans president and chief executive officer thank you dave good morning everybody please let me take this opportunity to once again recognize and congratulate dave on his retirement after more than 29 years of service with our company and served our employees and our customers and our shareholders very well david has done an extraordinary job in my opinion leading creating and growing the company that we know today and i am enjoying and valuing my relationship with dave as our executive chairman of the board and we continue to wish david and diana a great happiness as they enter their next chapter of their life together i ll be starting on slide 3 of our presentation i ll cover the highlights of the quarter rich will then provide his financial update and then i ll finish with the discussion around our strategy before i cover highlights on slide 5 i too would like to take a moment to recognize the 2018 achievements that are represented within the materials that we re going to present this morning advertisement advertisement these achievements are certainly not possible without our investors both large and small investors they entrust us with their savings and we thank them for that without the broad access to cost effective capital from our investors we would not be able to make the necessary investments that we do to provide safe and reliable energy to our customers we are laser focused on delivering for our customers and our investors this year and we re also prepared for 2020 and beyond also at black hills we take safety very seriously and it continues to be top of mind with an enhanced commitment in everything that we do we set an all time record in 2018 with the fewest number of employee injuries from boots on the ground to safety in the office every meeting and every job we do starts with what we call a safety share or a safety tailboard in the field all potential hazards are discussed before the job begins and necessary precautions are taken to protect employees and our communities a sustained and strengthened safety culture requires persistent daily attention in everything that we do and i assure you that all of us at black hills take that very seriously we had an outstanding fourth quarter and full year 2018 operationally financially and strategically our entire black hills team continued to execute our electric and natural gas utility strategy and have shelled through a variety of successes across the organization operationally we delivered excellent performance being ready to deliver reliable service during all time peak weather demands enabling strong financial results financially we reported earnings above our guidance range mainly related to weather benefits compared to normal weather of 0 06 per share for the quarter and 0 09 per share for the full year strategically we planned for and executed a comprehensive regulatory agenda and i am proud of how the organization responded we further demonstrated our customer focus in 2018 laying the groundwork for upgrading and modernizing our utility infrastructure systems while we continue to transform the customer experience advertisement advertisement and then to cap off our achievements for the year we did celebrate our 135th anniversary of serving customers we ve come a long way from our origins when we introduced electric lights to the western frontier back in 1883 now moving to slide 5 and our highlights for our electric utilities on december 17 we requested approval for our voluntary renewable energy tariffs in south dakota and wyoming and i plan to provide additional details about this later in the presentation on november 30 we filed our integrated resource plan in wyoming we are recommending that we serve customers through a balanced mix of generation resources that will include coal natural gas and renewables a balanced mix of generation assets will allow us to deliver reliable and affordable energy to customers while adding renewable energy resources as it make sense for our customers and shareholders importantly the resource plan also notes that the wygen 1 power plant is the most economic resource to meet our near term capacity shortfall under all modeling scenarios in october wyoming electric received approval from the wyoming public service commission for a multiyear multi docket settlement to resolve issues related to our power cost adjustment now importantly the settlement provides us clarity for the wygen 1 power purchase agreement through 2022 and rich will provide details around the customer credits related to this settlement in his financial update turning to slide 6 last summer both colorado electric and wyoming electric set new all time peak loads then in the fourth quarter both of our colorado electric and wyoming electric utilities set new record winter peak loads indicating ongoing load growth in those jurisdictions gas utility highlights on slide 6 now in february 1 2019 colorado gas filed a rate review proposal with the colorado commission to consolidate the rates the tariffs and the services of our two legacy gas utilities in colorado this is another step in our jurisdiction simplification you may recall that in 2018 we filed a request with the colorado commission to approve the legal consolidation of our two legacy utilities into a single new company advertisement advertisement we received approval for that consolidation last october and then we completed the consolidation in excuse me in december our colorado gas rate review filing also requests a new rider mechanism to recover integrity investments that we have identified within colorado in november our gas utilities received approval from the wyoming commission to construct the 54 million natural bridge pipeline to improve safe supply diversity and delivery capacity for our customers in central wyoming and we expect this pipeline to be in service in late 2019 in october we received approval in arkansas for our first rate review since acquiring gas utility operations in the state new rates were implemented in mid october to recover more than 160 million of utility infrastructure investments as we support the robust economic growth being experienced in the northwest arkansas and in support of our continued safety and reliability investments on behalf of our customers now moving to slide 7 in december our power generation segment acquired a 50 interest in the busch ranch 1 wind farm in colorado which provides renewable energy to our colorado electric utility under a power purchase agreement that agreement expires in 2037 our colorado electric utility owns the other 50 interest in busch ranch 1 and also operates the entire facility on january 30 our board declared a quarterly dividend of 50 and a half cents per share which represents an annualized rate of 2 02 in 2019 and is our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase one of the longest track records in the utility industry and a record we are proud of and we are determined to continue last november we increased the dividend by 6 3 moving to slide 8 as noted earlier david retired as ceo effective december 31 he has continued to serve as executive chairman until may of 2020 when his current board term will expire i m both humbled and excited to lead black hills as we focus on our natural gas and electric utility strategy as we deliver benefits to customers and shareholders now shifting back to the quarter advertisement advertisement we completed the conversion of our equity units on november first we issued 6 37 million shares of new common stock this milestone completed the financing related to the very successful acquisition of source gas back in february of 2016 slides 9 and 10 illustrate our excellent fourth quarter and full year earnings driven by strong results in our gas utilities the gas utilities benefited from new rates associated with three completed rate reviews return on new infrastructure investments residential growth increased usage per customer and colder weather you can find the full year highlights and more details on specific items in our earnings release which we distributed last night now i ll turn it over to rich for his financial update rich rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer very good thank you lin and good morning everyone as lin noted we enjoyed strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2018 i ll start on slide 12 where we reconciled gaap earnings to earnings from continuing operations as adjusted a non gaap measure advertisement advertisement we do this to isolate special items and communicate earnings that better represent our ongoing performance this slide displays the last five quarters and full years 2017 and 2018 working from top to bottom on the slide the first special item is related to onetime acquisition costs incurred as part of the source gas integration which wrapped up in 2017 the second item relates primarily to tax reform at the end of 2017 we recorded a benefit related to tax reform in 2018 certain benefits and expenses associated with the new law netted to 0 07 of expense for the full year the tax reform items this year related to our continued evaluation of the impact of the new law on our financial statements as well as impacts from continued revisions and irs guidance regarding the new law the largest special item you see is related to the tax benefit of legal restructurings completed in 2018 as part of an effort to simplify our legal organization in q1 and q4 we restructured certain entities acquired as part of the source gas acquisition the restructurings increased goodwill that is amortizable for tax purposes resulting in a 49 million deferred tax benefit in the first quarter and a 23 million deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter for a total of 1 31 per share for the full year the special items on this page are not indicative of an ongoing performance and accordingly we reflected them on as adjusted basis as adjusted eps for the fourth quarter grew 7 to 1 05 per share compared to 0 98 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year as adjusted eps increased 5 in 2018 to 3 54 per share compared to 3 36 per share in 2017 this growth was driven mainly by strong performance at our gas utilities as lin noted earlier we benefited from colder than normal weather across our service territories in 2018 and we estimate that 0 06 of eps in the fourth quarter and 0 09 of eps for the full year resulted from favorable weather compared to normal backing the 0 06 of favorability in the fourth quarter off the 3 54 our eps would have been 3 48 which is within the high end of the guidance range of 3 35 to 3 50 that we issued in early november the waterfall chart on slide 13 illustrates major drivers bridging net income from q4 2017 to q4 2018 all amounts on this chart are net of income tax you ll note we had a revenue reduction in 2018 as a result of passing tax reform benefits on to our utility customers these revenue reductions are offset by reduced income tax outside the tax reform the biggest item of note is that our gas utilities gross margin for the fourth quarter demonstrated substantial improvement driving our 13 increase in as adjusted net income compared to the fourth quarter last year i ll detail segment performance shortly the waterfall chart on slide 14 illustrates major drivers bridging net income for full year 2017 into full year 2018 as with the fourth quarter chart all amounts in this chart are net of income taxes again we had a revenue reduction in 2018 as a result of passing tax reform benefits on to our utility customers which is offset by reduced taxes and strong margin improvement at the gas utilities drove our 6 increase in as adjusted net income slide 15 displays our fourth quarter and full year income statements comparing 2018 to 2017 we delivered growth in income from continuing operations as adjusted from both the fourth quarter and the full year operating income and ebitda decreased in 2018 mainly due to the reductions in revenue and gross margin from delivering approximately 43 million of tax reform benefits to our utility customers again this reduction in revenue gross margin is offset by reduced income taxes so the effect on the bottom line is neutral operating expenses increased by over 5 year over year however 2018 operating expenses included a few nonrecurring items such as the 30 day wygen 1 major outage which included a million 1 3 million of o m and bad debt was 2 1 million higher in 2018 due to increased revenue recognized backing these amounts out of 2018 operating expenses yields an approximately 4 normalized increase in operating expenses year over year we did make targeted o m investments during 2018 by hiring additional people in our higher growth areas like arkansas and in areas such as gas engineering and regulatory to support our customer focused capital program looking ahead we expect o m escalation to be near inflationary we remain committed to our long term objective of improving efficiencies for our customers also of note is that during 2018 we recognized approximately 69 million in onetime reductions of income tax expense related primarily to the legal restructurings i mentioned previously excluding those onetime net benefits in our tax expense line our effective tax rate would ve been 17 6 for the full year which is about what we would have expected income from continuing operations as adjusted increased 6 from 185 3 million in 2017 to 196 5 million in 2018 you will note our diluted share count increased year over year on november first 2018 we issued 6 37 million common shares upon conversion of unit mandatory securities issued in late 2015 to help fund the source gas acquisition this brought our year end actual diluted share count to just under 60 million shares overall we re pleased with the earnings per share growth from 3 36 to 3 54 slide 16 displays our electric utilities gross margin and operating income the electric utilities gross margin was relatively flat for the fourth quarter and full year compared to 2017 predominantly driven by increases from shared facility revenue returns on transmission investments and favorable weather offset by lower revenue due to tax reform the shared facility revenue is new in 2018 and is reflective of south dakota electric owning our new corporate headquarters and receiving rent from all our subsidiaries this amounted to 9 8 million in 2018 over 2017 this compares in difference and our segment information will go away in 2019 another notable gross margin item relates to the 7 million wyoming pca settlement we reached in october we recorded a 1 7 million reserve associated with this issue in 2017 and another 4 3 million in 2018 so we have 6 million of the 7 million settlement recorded through year end 2018 with 500 000 to be expensed in each 2019 and 2020 per the terms of the settlement other gross margin changes for the quarter and year over year are detailed in our press release yesterday operating expenses were 4 6 million higher in the fourth quarter and 19 2 million for the full year as a result of increase expenses associated with vegetation management shared facility ramp and depreciation operating income decreased by approximately 22 million for full year 2018 compared to 2017 again this decrease in operating income is attributed to delivering approximately 22 million in tax reform benefits to our customers which is offset by lower income tax moving to slide 17 from an operating income perspective our gas utilities were flat year over year which is remarkable given the effective tax reform on operating income gross margin increased by 25 million despite delivering approximately 21 million of tax reform benefits to customers the year over year margin increase was the result of new rates from three completed rate reviews return on new infrastructure investments residential customer growth increased usage per customer and favorable weather operating expenses were approximately 25 million higher year over year offsetting the increase in gross margin operating expenses increased as a result of higher employee and contract related costs associated with growth in our service territories higher facility costs higher uncollectible accounts and increased from increased revenue and higher depreciation expense again achieving flat operating income at our gas utilities year over year is quite remarkable given the effective tax reform as you saw back on slide 10 on an as adjusted basis the gas utilities increased their contribution to earnings by nearly 18 million comparing 2018 to 2017 next i ll talk about gross margin impact from weather at both our electric and gas utilities when compared to normal as opposed to comparing to last year in the fourth quarter compared to normal weather favorability impacted our gas utilities gross margin by an estimated 4 1 million and our electric utilities gross margin by approximately 400 000 for the full year compared to normal weather favorability impacted our gas utilities gross margin by an estimated 4 6 million and our electric utility gross margins by an estimated 1 8 million on slide 18 you see that power generation operating income decreased 3 2 million for the fourth quarter 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased by 4 1 million year over year primarily driven by a planned major turbine outage on wygen 1 that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 this scheduled outage reduced revenue by 2 9 million year over year and increased o m by approximately 1 3 million year over year outside of that outage the power generation segment continued to realize strong contract availability from its generating units and continued its strong cash flow contributions on slide 19 in the fourth quarter of 2018 our mining segment had an 800 000 operating income increase compared to the fourth quarter in 2017 for the quarter revenue declined 900 000 with unfavorable tons sold primarily driven by the wygen 1 outage this revenue decrease was more than offset by decreased maintenance and overburden removal costs compared to the prior year for the full year 2018 mining operating income increased by 2 8 million revenue was 1 4 million higher for the full year with the benefit of increased pricing partially offset by lower tons sold compared to full year 2017 on the cost side we had decreased costs of 1 4 million primarily driven by lower maintenance and mining costs in 2018 the mine continues to perform at a high level and sales almost entirely to on site and mine mouth plants with roughly half our sales based on a cost plus pricing methodology slide 20 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure credit ratings and financial flexibility our credit ratings are strong at bbb plus at both fitch and s p and baa2 at moody s we remain committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings at the end of 2018 our debt to total capitalization ratio of 58 9 was a 710 basis point improvement from year end 2017 we met our commitment to improve our capital structure after the acquisition of source gas and reduced our debt to cap ratio below 60 by the end of 2018 this improvement was in large part driven by the final settlement of our equity units and the resulting conversion of the unit mandatories to common equity on november first we used the proceeds received from the settlement to pay off the 250 million notes due january of 2019 and reduce short term debt we continue to target a debt to total capitalization ratio in the mid 50s over the long term looking to the future we have strong and stable cash flows from our businesses a very manageable debt maturity schedule and access to liquidity through our revolver and at the market equity program providing us plenty of flexibility to fund our strong capital expenditure program slide 21 illustrates our dividend track record we ve grown the dividend at a faster rate the past few years demonstrating our confidence in our future earnings growth potential as we ve stated in the past our intent is to not reduce the amount of the annual dividend increase and we maintain our dividend payout ratio policy of 50 to 60 of earnings on slide 22 we re reaffirming our earnings guidance for 2019 with a range of 3 35 to 3 55 per share and for 2020 with a range of 3 50 to 3 80 per share as i noted on our third quarter call back in november we don t intend to make two years of guidance our regular practice but providing this preliminary 2020 guidance to demonstrate confidence in our customer focused growth strategy which includes substantial capital expenditures to support the growth and maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our utility systems the major assumptions relied upon to formulate the earnings guidance for both 2019 and 2020 are noted on slides 59 and 60 in the appendix our capex disclosure has once again increased this quarter primarily due to the addition of the corriedale wind project in total 2018 through 2020 capex increased by 90 million from our previous disclosure in november we ve continued to assume annual equity issuances through our at the market equity program of 25 to 50 million in both 2019 and 2020 to help fund their capex program with that i m going to turn it back to lin to talk about our strategy lin evans president and chief executive officer thank you rich i ll be continuing on slide 24 which sets forth our strategic objectives update consistent with past several years we grouped our strategic goals into four major categories profitable growth valued service better every day and great workplace our overall objective is to perform as a best in class utility in everything that we do with the strategic divestiture of our final non utility supporting business the entire black hills team continues to be tightly aligned as we execute our customer focused utility strategy on slide 25 we have completed the process of transitioning our earnings growth drivers from an acquisition and integration focus to a more traditional customer focused utility growth strategy from a strategy execution perspective we are focused on delivering long term shareholder value returns driven by our customer focused capital investment program our continued focus on standardization and efficiency improvements across the entire organization more regular rate review filings as we return to a more traditional utility model and achieving greater burner tip saturation in our gas utilities and adding load in our electric utilities additionally we target a dividend payout ratio of 50 to 60 our team is determined to continue our track record of 49 consecutive annual dividend increases moving to slide 26 this slide illustrates the diversity between our electric and gas utilities for complementary seasonality and the broad customer locations we serve in stable and growing states this diversity reduces business risk and delivers earnings that are more predictable risk from any particular region or business are diminished in light of the total company scale as illustrated on slide 27 our strategic utility acquisitions over the years have created greater investment opportunities for our larger transmission and distribution systems and expanded customer base these larger systems across eight states provide more diverse opportunities for investments more interconnections for reliability and growth and greater overall efficiency of operations on slide 28 our larger systems require significant long term investments to meet our customers needs we anticipate significant ongoing capital investment requirements focused on safety and reliability and supporting customer growth these forecasted levels of investment needs far exceed forecasted appreciation which will translate to earnings growth as we ve noted on prior calls we normally add capital to the outer years as those gears get closer and as we gain more comfort around specific projects our total five year forecast of capital expenditures of more than 2 5 billion has potential for incremental opportunities which we are still evaluating with the build out of our programmatic infrastructure replacement plans combined with growth in larger project opportunities we fully expect our actual capital expenditures will be greater we updated our capital investment plan again this quarter by adding our current 2023 capital investment forecast as a reminder we added 208 million to the capital investment plan last quarter our current capital forecast now includes a couple of larger projects including the natural bridge pipeline near casper wyoming and the busch ranch 2 wind farm currently under construction in colorado this capital forecast also includes some initial capital for me in the proposed pens mega rule as it s sometimes referred to i want to have one more comment around capital investment and earnings growth we believe our base investment forecast will translate to earnings growth rates above the utility industry average as we consider other growth objectives that have meters and have load and as larger customer focused capital investment projects that we don t currently have in the forecast start to come to fruition we will then add to our base forecast then we should achieve even higher earnings growth rates slide 29 illustrates the background of our five year capital forecast excuse me the breakdown our 90 of our forecasted investment is in our utilities those utility investments over 70 are recovered in an accelerated manner moving to slide 30 now this slide provides detail on forecasted capital investment for our gas utilities including breakouts by state by investment type and by recovery mechanism the forecast includes the addition of the natural bridge pipeline project this year as well slide 31 illustrates our base expectations around our long term recurring capital outlook at our gas utilities of at least 225 to 250 million annually related primarily to programmatic safety investment for both gas distribution and gas transmission as we note on the slide and as i stated on slide 28 larger pipeline and storage product will be incremental to this base expectation slide 32 provides detail on forecasted capital investment for our electric utilities as noted before we ve added 57 million for the corridale wind project across 2019 and 2020 slide 33 illustrates our current expectation of 120 million to 140 million of annual base investment in our electric utilities 80 of which to ensure a safe and reliable system large generation renewable and transmission projects will be incremental through this recurring annual expectation with our natural gas electric utilities combined our current expectation for annual recurring base investment is 345 million to 390 million plus incremental large projects across both utilities again as we enhance our customer investment programs and continue to grow we expect our gas and electric utility capital forecast will increase as we grow to as we continue to evaluate our system moving to slide 34 as i noted earlier black hills planned and executed extremely well a comprehensive regulatory agenda in 2018 we successfully completed three rate reviews including our first at arkansas gas we provided tax reform benefits to customers in six states we prepared and filed an electric resource plan in wyoming we received approval for the natural bridge pipeline also in wyoming we requested approval for the corridale wind energy project we also commenced proceedings in colorado to consolidate two gas utilities within the state we completed that legal consolidation in december and we recently filed a rate review application to consolidate the rates the tariffs and the services from our two legacy gas utilities the table also shows the ongoing tax reform effort in wyoming and we expect to receive approval in the first half of 2019 to date we have returned approximately 43 million of benefits to customers related to the tax cuts and jobs act moving to slide 35 this slide shows a timeline around our multistate jurisdiction simplification efforts we have three states in which we own multiple gas distribution utilities colorado nebraska and wyoming we strongly believe consolidation of the multiple entities within each of these states will provide long lasting benefits for all of our stakeholders including our regulators through streamlined and fewer regulatory proceedings and filings consolidation will also simplify the customer billing process and improve how we deliver customer service through fewer tariffs to manage having fewer jurisdiction entities will reduce our risk and also reduce both the complexity and the quantity of rate reviews regulatory filings and other reporting requirements we also make corporate processes simpler and in some cases it provided onetime tax benefits wyoming electric will likely file a legal consolidation request in the first quarter of 2019 and if approved we will file a consolidated rate review later in 2019 nebraska will most likely file a legal consolidation request in the first half of 2019 prior to our current plan and to file a rate review likely 2020 moving now to slide 36 to support our renewable ready program as we call it we submitted request for approval of tariffs to both south dakota and the wyoming commissions this tariff and program if it s approved will provide government and larger commercial and industrial customers a cost effective option to purchase utility scale renewable energy up to 100 of their needs so far we have received strong interest from potential customers got renewable energy this program is basically a subscription program that offers customers contracts and duration of five years and up to 25 years if we continue to experience sufficient interest the program would essentially fund the rate base investment required to provide renewable energy and this program is designed to keep these larger customers on our electric utilities systems while protecting remaining customers from the potential loss of load slide 37 on this slide we focus every day on operational excellence our safety performance continues to be excellent and our reliability for 2018 was outstanding even though we did not quite achieve our internal safety goal this year we delivered a record year respect to the fewest number of our employee injuries all three electric utilities achieved reliability in the top quartile of all electric utilities in the country we also received employee recognition in south dakota and in nebraska for their safety and their community service slide 38 contains our 2018 scorecard and this will be our final review of how we did for this last year with many successes across the board all in all i feel very good about our accomplishments in 2018 now slide 29 introduces our 2019 scorecards listing a number of priorities across our organization the scorecard includes a number of key objectives including executing on our capital program and completing construction of three major projects the natural bridge pipeline the busch ranch 2 wind farm and the rapid city to stigo transmission line in conclusion 2018 was a very eventful and productive year for black hills and i m very proud of our accomplishments and the performance of the entire black hills team we re really excited about 2019 as we execute on our natural gas and electric utility strategy we will continue to transform the customer experience we will remain laser focused on delivering results for shareholders and we will continue our journey to become the safest utility in the industry this concludes my and rich s remarks and we re happy to take questions please questions and answers operator our first question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning congratulations lin evans president and chief executive officer good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst and all the best to david yeah so perhaps just to kick things off at a high level you talked strategy you talked about being above average among the utilities can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think about that just is that under using the current forecast and through what period are you thinking sorry to ask you for a little more detail here but i just want to get a little bit clear on how you re thinking about it lin evans president and chief executive officer we see that julien for the next through 2023 we have strong capital spending as we said earlier and we said before in meetings like this as we get closer to those years we routinely find projects that we are working on as we find we re working on projects as they come to fruition then we begin to add them to the capital and so we see i see strong spreading through 2023 as we put into this presentation this quarter and we also see that ongoing rate spending of up to 390 million of being something that we re going to continue to do so we serve territories that are growing we serve territories now with especially up to the source gas transaction and we have opportunities to enhance our customer reliability enhance our system for customer reliability and continue to improve safety within our territory so we see above industry average growth in the near term and in the midterm as well at least through 2023 julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent so let me get a little bit more the details there if you can obviously a nice quarter over quarter increase again in the capex just wanted to make sure i know what s in and more importantly what s out of the capex still as it stands today i think you said several times the natural bridge program busch ranch etc are in the capex program but outside of it i think you said the tariff program in south dakota and wyoming still excluded what else is outside of it and how do you think about a the timeline to getting that into the capex program and b at least specific to the tariff program the magnitude of the capital rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer julien it s rich the corridale project which supports renewable ready is in the capex that s one of the additions we made so that s 57 million in the addition you saw julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok all right excellent now are there other products that are excluded i know that sort of the quarter over quarter increases that we ve seen it seems like it s largely reflective of this point in time but is there anything else with respect to the capital program that you just discussed that are excluded rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve got a lot of projects that we ve identified that we re working on again we typically don t add them to this capex until either we file the cpcn or otherwise advance the project to a point where we re comfortable adding it but i think the point that lin was making earlier and that i ll reiterate is it s very likely that you will see that forward capex schedule continue to increase as we get to smooth from up around the different projects we re looking at julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent rich one quick follow up there on 18 very nicely done i want to just clarify here obviously there s a good chunk of weather there year over year as you roll into 19 here any favorable tailwinds that we should be paying attention to that have materialized to get you above 2018 here just to make sure we re not missing anything rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer if you re referring to weather we re in the process of closing our january books and so nothing to share there but i will say it was warm to start the year for the first couple weeks and then as you know the latter half of january has been pretty cold so at this point kind of averaging that out i d characterize it as normal nothing s materialized that would make us change the assumptions that we ve put in our guidance and that s why we reaffirmed it julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it but nothing outside of weather that you d be flagging or just that drove the beat on 18 to pay attention to in the 19 rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer nope julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok all right excellent well thank you all very much rich kinzley senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you julien operator our next question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse your line is now open michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys how are you doing lin evans president and chief executive officer great michael good morning how are you michael weinstein credit suisse analyst great so on the renewable ready program how big can that program get and what are you thinking about in terms of future growth for it and does it become a material driver of capex at some point you know lin evans president and chief executive officer it s a good question it s early in the process michael so i wouldn t analyze it we ve been approaching our top when i say our largest customers especially in south dakota and wyoming with this concept we started talking to them several months ago and i d say we were a little bit on the surprised side how interested those customers were and they have expressed strong interest frankly in fact when we filed the tariffs we asked the customers who had high interest to sign kind of letters of intent if you will to establish with our regulators that there is interest in this kind of a program and we ve kind of just scratched the surface we plan to talk the tariffs propose that our top 600 customers would be eligible for the tariff and we re working our way down the list so we will see i m pretty excited about it personally i believe that we may have opportunity beyond this project but we have a ways to go to determine that michael weinstein credit suisse analyst ok and with the emphasis on consolidation at the utilities colorado and wyoming coming up i know you said that the m a is a or acquisitions at least from a strategy point of view has been deemphasized and that continues to be the case now in 2019 but what about divestitures which is another that you specifically mentioned that is not included in the guidance but is there any additional consolidation through divestitures that might to be being considered or would be considered going forward lin evans president and chief executive officer michael i think the short answer to that is no we like the territories that we re in they re growing territories and we re in the utilities business and we re going to appreciate those that we have so the short answer is no michael weinstein credit suisse analyst and one final question about wire duct and pacific core i don t know if you ve gotten any kind of indication from them as to whether they intend to go extend their life of that plant beyond 2022 and if they did decide not to and the contract for coal with pacificorp was ended at that point what would be the impact on net income lin evans president and chief executive officer good question we ve been watching their irps closely and of course having conversations with pacific core and frankly we re in negotiations with them now as we reopen the coal contract for pricing if you ll note in there april as i recall 2017 irp they show why that plant is being a very low cost resource and operating it through to 2039 and then they re making their 2019 irp presentations now and those presentations continue to show the benefits of continuing to operate the wire duct plant now the other half of your so we don t we believe they will continue to operate it the other side of your question what if they were to close it well we ll cross that bridge when we get to it but we do have cost plus contracts at the mine for our remaining plants and we would certainly rightsize the mine and operate it as efficiently as we could from that perspective going forward michael weinstein credit suisse analyst so there would be a path to mitigate any earnings impact essentially from shutting parts of the plant part of the mine lin evans president and chief executive officer we think so mike yeah michael weinstein credit suisse analyst ok ok great all right thank you very much appreciate it operator with no further questions i will return the call back to lin evans for closing remarks go ahead sir lin evans president and chief executive officer thank you everyone for your interest in black hills i ll take this opportunity to once again thank our employee team for an outstanding 2018 and ask for their continued focus on 2019 as we execute our strategy and thank you for your interest in black hills and have a great day thank you operator duration 51 minutes call participants jerome nichols

addis ababa ethiopia persisting trade tensions between economic superpowers the united states and china could shave 0 7 per cent from africa s gdp in 2019 a senior official at the african development bank afdb said on friday hanan morsy director of the afdb s macroeconomic policy department made the prediction on the sidelines of an african union meeting in addis ababa as fresh doubts emerged over the prospects for us china trade war negotiations she was speaking after the release of the bank s african economic outlook 2019 report which said the continent registered growth of 3 5 per cent in 2018 and was expected to grow 4 per cent in 2019 this is higher than most regions of the world but still insufficient to address persistent fiscal and current account deficits and unsustainable debt furthermore the ongoing trade battle between the us and china could have a negative impact of 0 7 per cent of gdp from africa this impact will be through lack of trade and investment flows afdb in particular expects a noticeable impact in the tradeable sectors including export commodities like minerals oil and food related products she added the united states has threatened to more than double existing tariffs on chinese goods at the start of march if there is no agreement on measures to reform china s trade practices which washington says are deeply unfair us president donald trump said thursday he did not expect to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping before the march 1 deadline leading to a slump in world stock markets top white house economist larry kudlow told fox business on thursday that while trump was optimistic about prospects for a deal there remained a sizeable distance separating the two sides a lack of a breakthrough could weaken the global economy with already gloomy growth forecasts from the european commission on thursday which predicted lower than expected growth of 1 3 per cent in the eurozone this year a slowdown in the global economy could lead to a decline in demand for africa s exports more than 60 per cent of which head to the us china and europe said the afdb report the report said that in 2019 40 per cent of african countries are projected to see growth of at least 5 per cent however a burgeoning working age population means the continent needs to create 12 million jobs a year meaning the nature of economic growth has to change to move away from mainly informal sector jobs
the interim budget presented to parliament by interim finance minister piyush goyal fits into a pattern taken together the five budget speeches of finance minister arun jaitley and the sixth one by goyal present the bharatiya janata partyâ s vision for the economy and the polity how different is the bjpâ s economic vision from that of the erstwhile indian national congress and its contemporary version the sonia congress there is an increasing emphasis in the â modi budgetsâ so to speak on offering something to everyone it is like what so many indian restaurants offer to their customers â north indian south indian chinese fast foodâ advertisement a bjp budget speech sounds so much like good old congress speak goyal has not left any significant socio economic group out of his speech from farmers to soldiers salary earners to investors there is something for everyone at its core the bjpâ s economic vision is no different from that of the congress borrowing political scientist rajni kothariâ s evocative phrase one can say that the bjp is trying to put in place its own version of the old congress systemâ of appealing to a wide cross section of society going beyond its narrow and limiting â hindu hindi heartlandâ to emerge as a dominant national political force if there is any departure from the norm it is the emphasis on the wants of the â aspirational indiansâ but there are limits to how much one can offer an aspiring voter it is best to stick to the knitting and focus on the perspiring one that is what goyal has done there are many promises for the future but the fiscal handouts here and now are for small and marginal farmers and the so called lower middle class â the economically weaker sections ews advertisement prime minister narendra modiâ s finance ministry has read the literature on political business cycles from polish economist michal kaleckiâ s 1943 paper to american economist william nordhausâ s paper of 1975 and beyond there has been growing literature on how political parties in government spend their way into elections in the hope of injecting a â feel good factorâ advertisement so the promised reduction in the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of national income will not happen anytime soon indeed even the budgetary commitment to bring it down to 3 3 percent has been compromised and the government has said it would be comfortable with a revised as well as a budget estimate of 3 4 percent such fiscal injections become even more necessary if there is a â feel badâ factor in play in the run up to an election more than the fiscal arithmetic of the budget is its political economy advertisement so what is that â feel badâ factor that the modi governmentâ s interim budget seeks to address clearly inflation is not such a major concern with oil prices down and food prices low but food has presented a problem the terms of trade between agriculture and the non agricultural economy have been adverse to the grower farm economists ramesh chand and sk srivastava of niti aayog have argued that a moderate increase in the wholesale price index along with a fall in food prices has resulted in adverse terms of trade for farm output that would explain the widespread view across the country that farmers are an aggrieved lot the pradhan mantri kisan samman nidhi pm kisan seeks to address precisely this concern taken together the pm kisan initiative and the pradhan mantri shram yogi maandhan will benefit 22 crore citizens â 12 crore farmers and 10 crore labourers advertisement the finance minister has provided pm kisan rs 20 000 crore in the revised estimates of the budget for 2018 19 and rs 75 000 crore in the 2019 20 budget this sum is to be disbursed in three instalments of rs 2 000 each to 12 crore farmers and tenant farmers with up to two hectares of land since this scheme is to be rolled out with retrospective effect from december 1 2018 it has generally been assumed in the commentary on the budget that at least two instalments will be paid into farmersâ accounts before the voting day assuming each instalment would cost rs 25 000 crore and given the additional provision already made in the 2018 19 budget it can be safely calculated that rs 50 000 crore will be injected into the farm economy this quarter that is a lot of purchasing power and that is what perking up the â political business cycleâ is all about advertisement a second feature of the budgetâ s political economy is the concession made to the lower middle class through a rebate provided for tax payers in the income bracket of up to rs 5 lakh per annum this gesture must be viewed along with the union governmentâ s decision in january to extend reservations to economically weaker sections among the upper castes this ews group of what are essentially lower middle class mostly upper caste urban families constitute the core of the bjpâ s support base especially in the hindi heartland advertisement the income tax rebate that is expected to benefit salary earners small businesses small traders pensioners and senior citizens is estimated to cost rs 18 500 crore thus while the interim budget speech promises many things to many people the interim finance minister has put his money where his mouth is mainly for farmers and the lower middle class advertisement the rest of the budget speech reads like the contours of the bjpâ s election manifesto the ten dimensional vision presented by goyal can be expected to frame the bjpâ s election manifesto however if in 2014 the bjp got elected based on its promises and vision in 2019 the voterâ s decision will be based on performance rather than promise sanjaya baru was chief editor the financial express and business standard
business zimbabwe should adopt the rand ex finance minister says bloomberg 9 feb 2019 zimbabwe should adopt south africa s rand as its currency one of a series of fundamental reforms needed to restore economic stability in the country former finance minister tendai biti said his call is an endorsement of government efforts to link zimbabwe s economy to neighboring south africa s currency as it grapples with a foreign exchange shortage that s spawned the fastest price increases since hyperinflation a decade ago zimbabwe abolished its own currency in 2009 and mainly uses the us dollar the american currency is too strong for the zimbabwean economy biti said friday in an interview in johannesburg joining the so called common monetary area in which namibia lesotho and eswatini peg their currencies to the rand would reduce costs he said the advantage of joining a rand monetary union would be that it would foist some much needed discipline on the zimbabwean economy biti said it would also enhance regional integration by giving manufacturers in the country access to 300 million consumers in southern africa compared with the 100 000 he estimates can still afford goods usually bought by the middle class in zimbabwe he said biti who served as finance minister from february 2009 until september 2013 is deputy chairman of the opposition movement for democratic change miracle of failure zimbabwe is considering pegging a planned new currency to the rand one of several proposals being discussed by the government the harare based financial gazette reported last week it may be favored because south africa is the country s biggest trading partner it said in addition to the dollar zimbabwe s central bank also prints quasi greenbacks called bond notes and an electronic currency known as rtgs to fund rampant government spending and stem the shortage of foreign exchange that s resulted in a convoluted system of exchange rates with consumers charged different prices depending on how they pay even though the government insists all the securities are at par with the dollar biti said both the bond notes and rtgs should be scrapped inflation reached an estimated 500 billion percent in 2008 before the zimbabwe dollar was scrapped the rate rose to 42 in december from 31 in november price growth risks are entering another hyperinflationary cycle driven by the government s insatiable appetite to spend money it doesn t have biti said to have two hyperinflationary spells in a period of 10 years is a miracle of failure biti said read zimbabwe to allow dollar trading
why for the upper class silence is golden perry rebuts aboud on cure for public ills after digesting gregory aboud s insightful commentary in the trinidad express it behooves me to offer a retort his silence of the elites piece is chicanery masked as concern for country and changing the status quo aboud may genuinely believe that he is offering a compelling and emphatic critique of his groups obsequiousness and complacency but his remarks actually show how detached he is how stupid must our elites actually think we are based on his argument because of the silence of elite upper class members of our society murders and other social ills are overwhelming our nation this seems like a somewhat arrogant and distorted view of reality for him the only transgression that elites have perpetrated is their silence that somehow our elites hold the key to solving our problems and the rest of society can benefit from their brilliant albeit muffled ideas this view is not only smug it is erroneous we often hear the biased reproaches of the chamber of commerce about national issues including the most recent sandals debacle that spurred arthur lok jack s rant he fails to convince me that he grasps the significant level of complicity of this group in many wide ranging problems they are waging longstanding silent class war aboud s attempt at showing empathy for sea lots seems either disingenuous or outright tone deaf study after study show a strong correlation between high wealth and income inequality and increases in criminality anyone who is honest would first acknowledge the high levels of inequality in our society is made worse by austerity meted out by the government since 2015 added to this is a heightened level of insecurity many people are experiencing many public servants today are on month to month contracts which weakens their bargaining power and reduces their quality of life as they face the increasing costs of living more people are also unemployed than they were a year ago especially university graduates some are in bullshit jobs according to the title of a recent book however mr aboud does not see this as part of the problem or the complicity of his class he ineluctably sees them as part of the solution many in our society driven by our government and the media have come to believe that the private sector is more efficient and innovative while the public sector is poorly managed and corrupt however this fact is not borne by solid evidence we hardly hear of the mainly failures in the private sector or why they were run down into the ground because that information is largely held in private circles recently a facebook post suggested that lok jack s carlton savannah was a failure in addition the incestuous connections between private companies and the government have been critical to the poor quality of our public services and many failing institutions mr aboud does not mention that our most well known corruption scandals like the piarco airport or massive construction projects under udecott the private sector has been active participants they have also been willing participants in the private outsourcing of public goods in health education and housing and have contributed to their poor quality and high costs instead he suggests that state failure and corruption are the cause and throws in the bogeyman venezuela for good measure in my respectful view mere show of concern by elites will not resolve the problems of community lawlessness long waits at the hospital difficulty for public

will allow private operators to offer transport services will bring immeasurable relief to the tobago economy and to its hotel and tourism industry since 1986 we have seen more and more participation of private sector interests in the public life of the country be it in healthcare education national security construction banking entertainment you name it about 95 per cent of all tertiary education institutions in this country that first benefited from dollar for dollar to gate programme are privately owned institutions when the government justified cutting and restructuring the gate programme much of the discussion centred on the abuse by students there was no mention of the low quality poor outcomes and hyper inflated courses by private entities which receive gate subsidies aboud suggests that further privatisation of healthcare through the public subsidising the private sector by tripling of the tax credit for health insurance for employees in the private sector as it will reduce the burden on public health institutions spawn an industry of private hospitals and enhance the quality of life of those with less privilege similar to that of the united states such a private insurance system has literally bankrupted numerous people and left millions who cannot afford healthcare and are dying because of it he fails to acknowledge that the rapid increase in private clinics hospitals nursing homes pharmacies or ambulance services have led to a simultaneous dramatic fall in overall health standards and service quality our two tier health system in which senior and junior doctors straddle both as public providers and profit making owners has also done little for equalising the provision of healthcare services t t is ranked among the countries with the lowest public funding spent on healthcare in latin america the public sector is therefore starved of funds to make improvements and has to prop up the failing system there is hardly talk about the fact that a large number of ambulances provided to public hospitals are privately operated or that the biggest financial beneficiary of the cdap programme are not the patients but private pharmacies one such private owner is a former minister of health who actually initiated the program when the public hospital pharmacies lack medicines no problem private pharmacies will do the needful real estate and housing construction is another area that is arguably receiving relatively the most public finance since the government started cutting back in 2015 there are more private contractors and construction companies than there has ever been in the history of the country they profit the most from large inflated contracts for housing and construction projects at high costs in the low income housing market meanwhile the population is continually told the public sector cannot supply all the demand for housing many working adults and millennials have resigned to living at home with parents for as long as possible as they cannot even begin to acquire a mortgage i bet you if the mark ups kickbacks and private contracting costs and corruption were eliminated the public sector would get significantly closer to providing all the housing needs of the country mr aboud believes that elites are busy running their legitimate businesses but they have been party to extracting the country s wealth and leading the public sector to bankruptcy as mr lok jack recently pointed out was its current state of affairs some of these funds could be used for providing much needed community and social support services in addition to the built house it is why the suggestion that more private provision of public goods is the answer is puzzling not only is he self serving he is condescending he conveniently joins the decriminalisation of marijuana bandwagon very concerned about showing the world the respect which we have for the rastafarian movement who have been constructive afro caribbean citizens perhaps those in sea lots come from a different breed and certainly he does not see dollar signs for his family and friends mr aboud s intervention is an unfortunate naked and hollow attempt at demanding a further transfer of wealth to the very elites he chastises a process that began in the late 1980s or known through much of our history we have seen that such an unholy alliance between business and political regimes does not serve the public good it enriches a few and punishes the majority of the population through austerity when times get harder the population does not need these hollow and myopic expressions of concern what we need to begin addressing our social ills is reprioritising of the public interest through a complete transformation of our political system from below it is only then we can really address poor public services and the ridiculous unequal distribution of resources that is causing more harm than good editor s note click here to read gregory aboud s silence of the elites column
why for the upper class silence is golden perry rebuts aboud on cure for public ills after digesting gregory aboud s insightful commentary in the trinidad express it behooves me to offer a retort his silence of the elites piece is chicanery masked as concern for country and changing the status quo aboud may genuinely believe that he is offering a compelling and emphatic critique of his groups obsequiousness and complacency but his remarks actually show how detached he is how stupid must our elites actually think we are based on his argument because of the silence of elite upper class members of our society murders and other social ills are overwhelming our nation this seems like a somewhat arrogant and distorted view of reality for him the only transgression that elites have perpetrated is their silence that somehow our elites hold the key to solving our problems and the rest of society can benefit from their brilliant albeit muffled ideas this view is not only smug it is erroneous we often hear the biased reproaches of the chamber of commerce about national issues including the most recent sandals debacle that spurred arthur lok jack s rant he fails to convince me that he grasps the significant level of complicity of this group in many wide ranging problems they are waging longstanding silent class war aboud s attempt at showing empathy for sea lots seems either disingenuous or outright tone deaf study after study show a strong correlation between high wealth and income inequality and increases in criminality anyone who is honest would first acknowledge the high levels of inequality in our society is made worse by austerity meted out by the government since 2015 added to this is a heightened level of insecurity many people are experiencing many public servants today are on month to month contracts which weakens their bargaining power and reduces their quality of life as they face the increasing costs of living more people are also unemployed than they were a year ago especially university graduates some are in bullshit jobs according to the title of a recent book however mr aboud does not see this as part of the problem or the complicity of his class he ineluctably sees them as part of the solution many in our society driven by our government and the media have come to believe that the private sector is more efficient and innovative while the public sector is poorly managed and corrupt however this fact is not borne by solid evidence we hardly hear of the mainly failures in the private sector or why they were run down into the ground because that information is largely held in private circles recently a facebook post suggested that lok jack s carlton savannah was a failure in addition the incestuous connections between private companies and the government have been critical to the poor quality of our public services and many failing institutions mr aboud does not mention that our most well known corruption scandals like the piarco airport or massive construction projects under udecott the private sector has been active participants they have also been willing participants in the private outsourcing of public goods in health education and housing and have contributed to their poor quality and high costs instead he suggests that state failure and corruption are the cause and throws in the bogeyman venezuela for good measure in my respectful view mere show of concern by elites will not resolve the problems of community lawlessness long waits at the hospital difficulty for public transport absent teachers in the classroom that he highlights he recommends deregulation of the air and sea bridge to tobago to allow private operators to offer transport services this in his view

congressional documents publications on behalf of the transportation trades department of the afl cio and our 32 affiliated unions i want to first thank chairman defazio and ranking member graves for inviting me to testify before you today and let me offer my congratulations to the new and returning members of this committee each of you asked to serve on this committee because you recognize the incredible and important role our transportation network plays in creating and sustaining good paying jobs and facilitating the world s most advanced economy and more often than not this committee demonstrates to the american people that party affiliations in washington d c can represent a wealth of good ideas and not just lines in the sand your willingness to work across those lines which too often divide us as a country was evident last year when you passed a long term reauthorization of our nation s air transportation programs and when you continued the committee s tradition of funding our water resources projects it was also evident three years ago when you passed a five year reauthorization of our transit highway and rail programs these were not easy jobs nonetheless many of you here today worked together to get them done let me be clear though while these were all good pieces of legislation that included hard fought provisions for america s working families i am sad to say they simply are not anywhere near enough they are not enough to meet the demands that we place on our transportation system today they are certainly not enough to meet the demands that are going to be placed on it in ten years and they are nowhere near what we need to leave a legacy for our children the way our parents and grandparents did when they had the courage to build something as impossible seeming as the interstate highway system and world class urban and rural transit systems in every part of our country rail lines that connected new york to california and nearly every state in between a network of more than 900 ports through which 99 percent of overseas trade passes and an aviation system that set the global standard for moving people and goods safely and efficiently across our skies yes past generations built a system of transportation infrastructure that inspired a nation but they did more than that by demanding that working people have a voice on the job and earn living wages our parents and grandparents helped define the american dream they created an economic system that allowed a middle class to grow and thrive by ensuring those who built this country and contributed to its economy enjoyed the protections and benefits of a strong union contract sadly today we are well past the point where we run the risk of letting those legacies quite literally crumble away we know that it hurts working families when the federal government fails to invest in infrastructure we know it hurts our economy we know that when the federal government fails to invest in infrastructure it leaves good union jobs on the table and delays the ability of goods and services to get to american manufacturers business owners and household consumers that is why today i want to take you past gdp indicators past the report card scores past the dizzying array of numbers any of us can point to and instead focus on the ways failing to invest in infrastructure takes a toll on working families i am talking about the young adult who is ready and willing to work but cannot find decent full time employment the single parent who burns the candle at both ends and is still barely able to scrape by the office workers who want to spend more time with the people they love but are held hostage by hours long work commutes the transit operators who in city after city wonder when not if backlogs of deferred maintenance will lead to another tragic incident all because of our failure to invest the people i am describing are real people they are the frontline transportation workers who want to operate and build a world class system they are the nurses teachers veterans government employees and business professionals who depend on a safe efficient transportation network they are your constituents back home and the impacts they feel today are only going to get worse if we decide that current federal measures are simply good enough take for example an iowa family who lives in an isolated corner of des moines like many americans they are struggling just to make ends meet and cannot afford a car a lack of public transit options means this family is forced to walk for two miles along the shoulder of a busy highway often in poor weather conditions and feet from speeding cars and trucks just to get groceries sadly many of their neighbors face the same problem the local transit authority is looking at options but tight budgets mean the authority is already struggling with existing routes federal investment here could mean a safer more reliable commute for the families of des moines and the creation of good operating and maintenance jobs for the community lack of reliable affordable public transportation is not lost on business leaders either in greenville south carolina employers representing more than 1 000 businesses in the area called on the county and the city to come together and identify solutions to provide better public transportation without it they simply will not be able to access enough workers to meet the needs of rapid economic growth in their city put simply a lack of resources to provide transportation options may stifle what should otherwise be a model success story for economic growth in a small american city down the road in fort mill employers have hired thousands of workers across multiple sectors but highways that are in desperate need of expansion have left commuters facing traffic headaches and safety issues so serious that they are beginning to look for work elsewhere leaving county officials worried that the rapid growth they have enjoyed could be brought to a grinding halt underinvestment is harming americans in small and large cities alike and takes a particular toll on those who are already underserved in so many other areas of their lives take for example chicago where young black adults face an unemployment crisis of startling proportions unemployment in illinois is at 4 3 percent yet 60 percent of black 20 to 24 year old chicago residents do not have jobs a recent study identified lack of public transportation options as a primary reason for that the majority of jobs in chicago are located downtown and on the city s northwest side far from chicago s traditionally black neighborhoods this is the very definition of what it means to be disadvantaged the same thing is happening in minnesota s twin cities where researchers noted that disadvantaged jobs seekers are often qualified for entry level positions located in the suburbs but have no way of actually getting to those jobs failing to invest in transportation infrastructure goes well beyond getting people to and from jobs that allow them to support their families just ask truck drivers at the port of virginia who come face to face with america s lack of infrastructure investment on a regular basis surges in containers from increasingly large ships regularly put the port over capacity creating traffic jams that can be 13 lanes wide 10 trucks deep and take eight hours to clear port congestion not only means truck drivers lose out on pay lessening their purchasing power and placing a strain on their communities but it means the shipment of goods and raw materials to retailers small businesses and farmers is severely delayed at our nation s airports the situation is not much better at lax the fourth busiest airport in the world air traffic controllers regularly work overtime because of severe staffing shortages raising concerns about fatigue traffic volumes and basic quality of life sadly the issues found in the lax control tower are just the tip of the iceberg across the aviation system frontline workers including those in other types of safety sensitive positions like systems specialists and transportation security agents are increasingly required to do more with less because of america s failure to invest in fact air and ground congestion at major airports has been identified as the biggest economic threat to our aviation industry yet inconsistent funding sequestration and government shutdowns have hobbled efforts designed to increase capacity we used to be a nation that was not afraid to dig deeper build higher or go faster but today we have turned a blind eye to projects that will make us better by failing to tackle some of our nation s largest and most pressing needs we are putting our country s entire economy on the line consider the gateway tunnel on the northeast corridor the northeast accounts for 30 percent of all jobs in the u s and contributes 3 trillion annually to the u s economy it is home to 51 million people one in seven americans a figure expected to hit 58 million by 2040 yet in the busiest rail corridor in the country we continue to move people and goods at maximum capacity through a hundred year old tunnel that has been in dire need of expansion and modernization for the past 25 years at the soo locks in sault ste marie michigan only one lock the poe lock built in 1896 is capable of handling the large lake freighters used on the upper great lakes one hundred percent of the iron ore mined in the united states comes through this one lock if it were to fail for six months or longer the u s department of homeland security estimates that it would have a 1 1 trillion dollar economic impact on our country and cause 11 million jobs to be lost yet this project is still waiting on crucial federal funding for the construction of a second lock meanwhile america s first truly high speed rail project which will lead to an estimated 7 6 billion in new business sales and 3 billion in new wages faces continuous threats by congress this is what good enough looks like our members stand ready willing and able to drive those buses in des moines and chicago to build those roads in fort mill to modernize and move freight in and out of our ports to make the most advanced aviation system in the world even more efficient to build the infrastructure we need today for the electric vehicles that are coming tomorrow and to dare to dream big with you on projects like the gateway tunnel and california high speed rail and yet we sit here today still trying to pay for a 21st century transportation network on a 1993 budget still seemingly unwilling to make the difficult political choices that frankly we do not think are all that difficult the policy solutions are no great mystery we know that a user fee supported system works when it generates enough revenue to meet our needs but that is simply no longer happening with the highway trust fund since 2008 congress has transferred 140 billion into the highway trust fund from the general treasury and even then it is just barely enough money to keep pace with current spending levels spending levels that do not even begin to address the larger investment gaps i have discussed today spending levels that we know must be dramatically increased if we are to compete in the world economy and provide mobility options that working families are calling for we have long supported efforts for a modest increase in the federal gas tax which remains the most efficient and reliable means to raise revenue for our surface transportation network yes an extra twenty five cents per gallon at the pump will increase costs for some consumers by roughly 100 per year but this calculation overlooks the fact that investing in american infrastructure will raise household income by a recent estimate to the tune of 1 400 per year we would also support any serious effort in this congress to lay the groundwork for a transition to a mileage based user fee as gasoline powered vehicles become more efficient and electric vehicles become more prevalent contributions to the highway trust fund will continue to dry up leaving us back in the same position we are today at a minimum congress should spearhead an immediate effort to dramatically expand the testing of a mileage based fee we should take the harbor maintenance trust fund off budget and stop raiding it to pay for other priorities america not one of our competitors should be home to the best ports the world has ever known what s more when congress cannot show responsibility with the money they collect for our trust funds it harms the public s faith in your work in a very real way this is about the health of our democracy i applaud chairman defazio s tireless efforts to see that this happens i should note that if we fix our highway trust fund and if we utilize the harbor maintenance trust fund for its intended purposes it will free up limited federal dollars for transportation needs that do not currently have access to a trust fund or user fee revenue we know that jobs created by smart investments in transportation and infrastructure are good jobs that people can raise families on in part this is because of high union density is some of these sectors and in part because of the federal policies that have been associated with these investments in particular labor standards specific to construction and transportation have been included in past infrastructure investment statutes and together have resulted in a high road labor model and ensured a skilled workforce is utilized these standards and other employee protections should be expanded and applied to future investments considered by the committee in addition buy america rules should be aggressively applied to federal infrastructure programs so that we can grow our manufacturing base as we seek to reverse decades of under investment it would be a grave mistake for the health of our nation to use an infrastructure bill to attack these important laws or to undercut collective bargaining rights that are essential to the good jobs that can and should be created in this space finally we are here today to talk about our nation s infrastructure and what happens if we don t invest but there is another piece of the puzzle that must be stated clearly and loudly we have to stop shutting down the federal government during the last shutdown the longest in u s history two agencies vital to our transportation system the u s department of transportation and u s department of homeland security went unfunded for 35 days grant money was not awarded to transit authorities accident investigators stayed home and critical frontline transportation workers including air traffic controllers faa inspectors and technicians and transportation security officers were forced to perform safety sensitive work without pay or in some cases not come to work at all if we want to improve transportation infrastructure in this country the very least we can do is put a stop to needless self inflicted wounds by way of government shutdowns by taking these steps today we can leave behind a legacy better than crumbling roads and insufficient transit better than seaports that no longer compete with our neighbors to the north and to the south better than airports where we ask our workforce to do more with less every single day better than an economy where the ultra wealthy only get richer at the expense of everyone else it is your turn in congress now to show america s working families that you are ready to meet this challenge to show our children the kind of courage and leadership that our parents dared to show us the kind of leadership that inspired a nation to invest in the economic wellbeing of its people by building the hoover dam the panama canal the interstate highway system and countless other projects named after great americans who dared to dream bigger than we seem capable of today we must not find ourselves back at this table in ten or thirty years asking what went wrong why nobody rose to meet the challenge and so i challenge each of you and all of us to seize the opportunity before us with that i am happy to answer any questions read this original document at
washington ap a new report from the white house tries to shift the trump administration s combative rhetoric on health care suggesting changes to the affordable care act under president donald trump do not fundamentally undermine the health law the council of economic advisers report released friday says obama era subsidies that help low and middle income customers pay their premiums will help keep healthcare gov afloat even if some healthy people drop out or seek other coverage because of trump s changes nearly 90 percent of customers get taxpayer provided assistance the report reflects the outcome of 2018 midterm elections in which democrats successfully campaigned on keeping the aca and effectively ended trump s drive to repeal it democratic 2020 white house hopefuls are seizing on health care as an issue with some pushing for a government run system that would cover all americans and replace the aca better known as obamacare the council is a white house agency that advises the president larry levitt of the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation said it suggests to him the administration is trying to move on from the battle over the aca which trump and republicans in congress failed to repeal the president seemed to take pride in undermining the aca but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law levitt said they can point to benefits of deregulation but will also have to live with the costs which include higher premiums for middle class people with pre existing conditions the aca has risen in popularity with the public the report looks at three big changes under trump that affect former president barack obama s health care law they are congressional repeal of the law s unpopular fines on people who go uninsured association health plans for small businesses and low cost short term health insurance that doesn t have to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs these reforms do not sabotage the aca but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax funded care to those in need says the report casting the administration s changes as de regulation it comes as house democrats under speaker nancy pelosi d calif are moving to shore up the aca including trying to undo some of trump s insurance changes although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre existing conditions restoring the ad budget for healthcare gov slashed by trump is also a possibility about 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the aca s subsidized markets or exchanges and another 12 million are covered by its medicaid expansion casey mulligan chief economist for the white house council said it turns out that the health law s penalty for people going uninsured wasn t really essential for the program to function he said the subsidies were more important removing the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars give families more choice without destabilizing the exchanges he said the report didn t address constitutional arguments in a texas court case against the aca brought by red state officials but its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case the plaintiffs contend that the whole law was made unconstitutional by congressional repeal of the fines on the uninsured a federal district court judge agreed and that ruling is on appeal the justice department has said in connection with the case that it will no longer defend the law s protections for people with pre existing conditions now the white house report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law officials at the council of economic advisers said they re not policymakers or lawyers but economists the report also claims 450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies and the cancelled fines but it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle and upper income consumers kaiser foundation analyst levitt said 450 billion seems high to him

business increased by 18 4 for the quarter this increase was the result of double digit growth in our subsidiary joint venture and distributor businesses china contributed significantly with gains of 21 5 or 27 2 on a constant currency basis our international sales including both wholesale and retail increased 17 9 for the quarter and 19 2 for the year and represented over 55 of our sales in the fourth quarter further detailing our international growth for the quarter our wholly owned international subsidiary business grew by 14 4 and our joint venture wholesale business by 19 5 for the quarter the significant dollar gains came from germany spain japan and peru within our subsidiaries and china india malaysia and singapore within our joint ventures china remains the largest country within our international portfolio with an annual sales increase of 29 1 and approximately 22 8 million pairs shipped in the full year at the close of the year in china we had 876 skechers freestanding stores a total of 2 390 points of sale and a 53 increase in our annual online sales to support our growing business we broke ground on an approximately 1 6 million square foot distribution center and logistics facility the facility is expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2020 our international distributor business increased 19 7 in the quarter primarily due to strong gains from indonesia russia turkey and the middle east and despite sizable headwinds in the first half of the year our international distributor sales increased 0 8 for the full year by quarter end there were 2 306 skechers branded stores owned and operated by international distribution partners joint ventures and a network of franchisees in the fourth quarter 195 third party owned stores opened including our first locations in cyprus northen cyprus and tanzania additional stores opened include 105 in china 24 in india six in australia five each in thailand and taiwan four each in south korea and spain three each in hong kong indonesia and vietnam two each in croatia honduras malaysia mexico norway and the philippines and one each in brazil canada cambodia colombia egypt england greece iraq macau netherlands northern ireland paraguay serbia singapore switzerland turkey ukraine and uruguay 40 third party stores closed in the fourth quarter 25 third party owned skechers stores have opened so far in the first quarter and three have closed which brings us to 2 328 third party owned stores as of today in 2019 we expect to open in excess of 500 third party owned skechers branded stores in the remainder of the year we continue to see international as the biggest growth opportunity for the company which is why we have transitioned india from a joint venture to a wholly owned subsidiary with approximately 220 skechers retail stores of which just over 60 are wholly owned and a new e commerce platform india was one of our fastest growing markets in 2018 with another 80 to 100 stores planned for 2019 we see great potential to grow our business in this country of 1 3 billion people and believe this will be accretive to our diluted earnings per share in 2019 mexico was another attractive growth opportunity for the skechers brand which is why we ve reached an agreement in principle to establish a joint venture with our current distribution partner operating more than 70 stores today we believe this market can support significant additional growth over the coming years when complete we believe that this transaction will also be accretive to earnings in our company owned global retail business sales increased 7 5 in the fourth quarter which was the result of sales increases of 3 3 on domestic retail stores and 15 9 in our international store which on a constant currency basis was 20 4 worldwide comp store sales increased 1 1 in the quarter which was the result of a 3 increase in our international stores and a 0 4 in our domestic sales for the full year sales increased 12 which was the result of an increase of 7 7 in our domestic retail stores and 21 2 in our international stores domestically our gross margins increased by 450 basis points in the quarter and by 160 basis points for the full year due to improved pricing and a decrease in promotional activity our domestic e commerce business continued to grow in 2018 by 8 9 for the quarter and 11 6 for the year we expect to launch improved functionality accessibility and user interfaces this year and also roll out company owned sites in more countries at year end we had 692 company owned skechers retail stores of which 222 were outside the united states in the fourth quarter we opened 11 stores five in the u s four in the uk and one each in peru and italy we also remodeled five stores relocated five stores and expanded three locations to date in this first quarter we have opened two stores and closed four bringing us to 690 company owned stores in 2019 we expect to open approximately 70 to 80 stores not including the india stores that we ll be opening and remodel relocate or expand an additional 20 to 30 existing stores now i ll turn the call over to john to review our financials john vandemore chief financial officer thank you david in the fourth quarter sales increased 11 4 over the prior year to 1 08 billion and represented a new fourth quarter record for the company it is especially gratifying that this growth was driven by contributions from each of our business segments international wholesale increased 18 4 which included a 19 5 increase in our joint ventures a 19 7 increase in our distributor business and a 14 4 increase from our wholly owned subsidiaries company owned global retail same store sales increased 7 5 the result of a 3 3 increase in domestic retail including e commerce and a 15 9 increase in international retail domestic wholesale increased 4 8 on previous calls we highlighted our expectation that foreign exchange rates would become a headwind in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the front half of 2019 for the quarter foreign exchange rates negatively impacted sales by 22 3 million or roughly 230 basis points of growth total sales on a constant currency basis grew 13 7 year over year gross profit was 515 7 million up 61 6 million compared to the prior year and gross margin increased over 90 basis points to 47 7 this improvement was attributable to stronger domestic wholesale and retail margins which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate sg a expenses grew 32 1 million or 7 9 this quarter within that selling expenses decreased 2 1 million to 61 8 million or 5 7 of sales which was a 90 basis point improvement from 6 6 of sales in the prior year general and administrative expenses were up 34 2 million to 375 million as a percentage of sales this was a 40 basis point improvement from 35 1 in the prior year to 34 7 this quarter the dollar increase reflects volume gains internationally as well as continued investment in our long term global growth initiative this included 8 8 million to support continued double digit growth in china it also included an increase of 9 4 million in retail from 47 additional company owned skechers stores worldwide of which 11 opened in the fourth quarter and 9 7 million related to domestic and corporate operations including increased distribution related costs driven by higher volume earnings from operations increased 50 4 versus the prior year to 83 7 million operating margin improved 200 basis points to 7 7 versus 5 7 in the prior year period our income tax rate for the quarter was 18 4 compared with 194 4 in the prior year period as a reminder our prior year rate included the impact of the then recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act excluding the discrete impact of that tax law change our prior year income tax rate would have been 12 2 our current year effective tax rate reflects our final assessment of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 14 and 18 net income for the fourth quarter was 47 4 million or 0 31 per diluted share on 155 million shares outstanding compared to a net loss of 66 7 million or 0 43 per diluted share on 156 1 million shares outstanding in the prior year period in december 2017 we recorded an income tax expense of 99 9 million representing 0 64 per diluted share due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act excluding that discreet tax item our adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of the prior year were 33 3 million or 0 21 per diluted share therefore on an adjusted basis our current year net income and earnings per diluted share grew 42 3 and 47 6 respectively during the fourth quarter we acquired approximately 1 7 million shares of our class a common stock at a cost of 42 million representing an average price of 25 22 per share since announcing our share repurchase program last year we have acquired almost 3 7 million shares at a cost of 100 million representing an average price of 27 34 per share at december 31 2018 50 million remained available under our existing repurchase authorization as we have stated before we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to fund our growth initiatives while continuing to return cash to shareholders our actions this past year reflect that confidence as well as our firm belief that skechers recent share price meaningfully undervalues our current earnings and cash flow profile as well as our long term growth prospects and now turning to our balance sheet at december 31 2018 we had 1 07 billion in cash cash equivalents and investments which was an increase of 312 2 million or 41 4 from december 31 2017 our cash and investments represented approximately 6 94 per diluted share outstanding at december 31 2018 trade accounts receivable at quarter end were 501 9 million an increase of 96 million from december 31 2017 and our dsos as of december 31 2018 were 36 days versus 32 days in 2017 total inventory including merchandise in transit was 863 3 million a decrease of 1 1 or 9 8 million from the prior year period this reflects our diligent management of inventory levels globally while fulfilling the requirements for our growth expectations and expanded retail store base long term debt was 88 1 million compared to 71 1 million at december 31 2017 primarily reflecting borrowings associated with the construction of our new distribution center in china working capital increased 114 2 million to approximately 1 62 billion versus 1 51 billion at december 31 2017 primarily reflecting higher accounts receivable levels as well as increased cash and investment balances capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately 45 6 million of which 19 3 million related to the construction of our distribution center in china 15 9 million related to 11 new company owned domestic and international store openings and six store remodels and 8 3 million related to our international wholesale operations in 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 275 million to 300 million this includes an additional 70 to 80 company owned retail stores and 20 to 30 store remodels expansions or relocations this also includes the construction of our new distribution center in china enhancement to our existing distribution centers in the united states and europe and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in california now turning to our guidance we currently expect first quarter sales will be in the range of 1 275 billion to 1 3 billion and net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of 0 70 to 0 75 this guidance takes into account the impact of the existing foreign exchange headwinds and a shift in some sales from the first to the second quarter due to the timing of easter this year it includes the estimated impact of our investments in india but does not include the benefit of our pending joint venture in mexico it is also important to point out that in last year s first quarter we benefited from a discreet tax item associated with the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act which represented 0 07 per diluted share we currently expect no such impact in the first quarter of 2019 i will now turn the call back to david for closing remarks david weinberg chief operating officer thank you john in 2018 we achieved several records most importantly record annual sales of 4 64 billion record operating income as well as record shipments from our distribution centers in north and south america europe and japan our growth in the year came despite foreign currency headwinds economic and political challenges in several markets and tough comparisons due to the strength of our sales in 2017 we believe the growth is attributable to our diverse product range which is focused on style comfort quality and innovation at an affordable price we are pleased that the year brought growth in both our heritage looks as well as newer looks from skechers cali bobs from skechers men s sport and casual among others we continue to invest in our brand through the opening of skechers retail stores ending the year at 2 998 companies company owned and third party owned stores with the opening of stores in the first quarter we now have more than 3 000 skechers stores around the world further we are planning to unveil a fully upgraded skechers e commerce site in the united states and several other countries in the second half of 2019 we continue to believe international holds the greatest growth potential and to this end this week we completed the repurchase of the minority stake of our india joint venture transitioning it to a subsidiary and are in the process of transitioning our mexico distributor to a joint venture we believe these efforts will be accretive to earnings as always we will remain focused on efficiently growing our business and are pleased that our efforts resulted in both record annual sales and earnings in 2018 and believe we can continue to achieve strong results in 2019 and with that i would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of the conference call questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of laurent vasilescu from macquarie group please proceed with your question laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my questions congrats on solid results i wanted to follow up on the china numbers they looked particularly strong in the fourth quarter how do we think about china for 2019 david weinberg chief operating officer well we see continued growth and while it s in our numbers and guidance for the first quarter it s understated by the significant difference in currency so while they ll be up significant double digits well at least double digits as far as we can see in local currency and in pairs shipped there will only be a slight increase in volume unless something changes significantly but we think as we go through the year the currency will sort of not have as great an impact and will continue to show significant double digit growth as we move into the balance of the year laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst very helpful and then on gross margins john maybe you can help us maybe walk to the drivers of the fourth quarter gross margin and how do we think about the first quarter gross margin john vandemore chief financial officer the fourth quarter gross margins were strong on the back of as we said domestic wholesale and retail performance as we have mentioned previously in the retail environment we had reduced some discounting activity and taking some limited pricing that continues to power through the retail business and they performed exceedingly well on a gross margin basis we also saw favorable trends in our domestic wholesale business both in terms of average price up and then costs down so we saw good mix trends there the offset as we mentioned was foreign exchange but again good solid performance on the margin basis going through our domestic businesses which i think speaks to the health overall of our domestic businesses when you include both the retail and the wholesale portion and obviously that speaks to the health of the consumer for us which has been performing well as you look at early 2019 we expect some modest improvement in q1 it remains to be seen exactly how material that is based on mix but we definitely expect some slight improvement in q1 i would only caveat as david mentioned that the foreign exchange rate again will continue to bedevil us over the first half of 2018 and in some of our core markets like china where the exchange rate differential is pretty severe in the first quarter based on what we know today laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst very helpful and then if i could squeeze one last one in international g a i think just backing out it looks like increased by 15 9 million half of that is china how do we think about that line item over the course of the first quarter and then potentially for the full year john vandemore chief financial officer well we re not going to give country specific guidance but i think what you saw in the fourth quarter was really probably more driven by volume gains as we ve mentioned before the p l structure of china wherein our distribution partners are third party there does tend to be a correlation with volume gains so we definitely saw that in the fourth quarter and i would expect it to be roughly in line with volume gains going into 2019 although again in any given quarter we can see timing shifts as we saw over the course of 2018 so we d be conscientious of that as well laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst very helpful thank you very much and best of luck john vandemore chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john kernan from cowen co please proceed with your question john kernan cowen and company analyst hi good afternoon guys congrats on a nice finish of the year david weinberg chief operating officer thank you john vandemore chief financial officer thanks john john kernan cowen and company analyst john can you just help us understand a little bit more about the first quarter and the implied top line guidance both for domestic wholesale and then the international piece as well i think there is some timing around easter that s moving numbers around as well so just any detail you can give us there would be very helpful thanks john vandemore chief financial officer yes so i mean and obviously the easter timing kind of put a question mark at the end of the quarter as to exactly how things shake out what we see at the moment is probably a flat to maybe slightly down domestic environment again part of that is timing associated with the holiday part of that is i think the continued retail shakeout we see in terms of international international will be a bit of a mixed bag we actually expect following a tough q1 last year that our distributor business will come back probably be high single digits low teens type performance and that s counterbalanced with the modest single digit growth internationally which i would tell you if it were are not for foreign exchange would be almost double because again we really seeing the headwinds come in our key markets in the first half of 2019 and then our retail business we believe will be a high single digit maybe low double digit number depending upon retail performance we are seeing good trends thus far this year certainly in the domestic market but there s a lot of selling to be done still so that s generally how we believe it shakes out that gives us kind of on an average basis again taking into account the fx probably a mid single digit number maybe a little bit lower than that maybe a little bit higher depending on things how how things mix out but again that would be almost double that if it weren t for foreign exchange john kernan cowen and company analyst sure that s helpful thank you i guess when you look to for a holiday for 2019 both for domestic and international i know you re not giving a full year guidance but just any detail on how those order books are starting to shake out you did exit the fourth quarter with an acceleration both in international wholesale and domestic wholesale so one would think that your partners are feeling pretty good in terms of orders for next fall david weinberg chief operating officer we re right in the middle of that process as we speak we have had very good pre lines and very good feedback the orders are starting to come in now we had a very good january on top of what was a significantly high growth incoming order rate last january so that makes it look even more solid so we re getting good reception and we re getting good sell throughs from the current line that s out there so i think we all here feel very positive about this transition into fall holiday and potentially even increased acceleration as we get there john kernan cowen and company analyst all right great congrats on a good 2018 and best of luck guys operator our next question comes from the line of lauren cassel from morgan stanley please proceed with your question lauren cassel morgan stanley analyst great thanks so much maybe could you guys talk about 4q performance within domestic wholesale by bucket so off price versus big box versus family channel how did those different areas perform and how are you thinking about each of those different channels to perform generally in 2019 john vandemore chief financial officer well i could definitely talk to q4 2019 is a little bit of a prognostication i would say generally we saw continued trends in the off price again keep in mind how you define off price matters for us we are looking at those that sell traditionally either liquidated inventory from others for us it s made for product or some in line product that fits their pricing portfolio we did see continued weakness in that based on really the trend we had been seeing since q2 although it did decline a bit outside of that though generally activity was pretty strong certainly we had some exceptional items going through the holiday that performed very well and that lifted some categories for us but generally i d say outside of kind of the off price channel which is again been a bit of a challenge over the back half of 2018 things were positive looking forward we continue to see as david mentioned strong interest in the product strong response from the lines that they ve seen and the lines they re booking on now however i d just caveat that the retail environment in united states has certainly seen its share of attrition in both stores and doors so i think that will have an impact what i think we ve been very pleased with is that for our key accounts we ve seen certainly in 18 growth and early 19 good indications that they re going to continue to grow lauren cassel morgan stanley analyst ok great thank you and then just within the 0 4 comp in the u s during the quarter just any commentary on full price versus the outlet stores there john vandemore chief financial officer well again keep in mind in the middle of the year we decided to change approaches in particular and probably most pronounced in our concept stores and if you really look at the detail underneath the store performance that s where you saw slightly lower comp store performance but again that s against the backdrop of delivering significantly better margin and actually gross margins were up in every single one of our store types it was just it was most pronounced in the concept sides of things so and again we re incredibly pleased with that response from a financial perspective and you are seeing good general activity in the domestic market which i think is probably for us when we think about the consumer a more important vantage point and david mentioned the domestic business grew and when you combine the retail and the wholesale in the quarter and that i think speaks to the consumer interest where that s going next year still remains to be seen because there s a lot of selling but we re not changing our approach and so i would probably suggest you ll see at least in the early part of the year some of the same trends again good gross margin performance and maybe that costs us a few on comp store sales points on a in some of our stores but generally speaking a very good financial result at the end of the day lauren cassel morgan stanley analyst ok thanks so much john vandemore chief financial officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of jay sole from ubs please proceed with your question jay sole ubs analyst great thank you i wanted to follow up on sg a john can you give us an idea of how you re thinking about sg a dollar growth for q1 and then also maybe in general terms how you re thinking about it for fiscal 19 john vandemore chief financial officer yes again keeping in mind that a portion certainly in the international side is volume driven it somewhat depends on the top line basically what we believe we ll see in the early part of the year is you ll still see growth in the sg a category but it will continue to moderate as compared to kind of last year s numbers once you x out the volume gains so the volume drives activity and that s certainly the kind of activity we want to see we re not planning for anything drastic in kind of a change year over year as a percentage of sales all things considered maybe some shifts between buckets or between categories within the totality of sg a but more than anything else right now i think what we re aiming for is stability against the backdrop of the growth that we see because keep in mind when you grow even though an fx adjusted growth rate is smaller when you talk about activities like pairs which have to move through the system you don t always get the full benefit of alignment kind of top line behavior in the sg a and in particular distribution related costs so there s some offset there but i would probably guide that you re looking at stability in that as a kind of overall percentage going into the first quarter jay sole ubs analyst ok and then maybe just to follow up there s been big investment been talked about in china headquarters los angeles that kind of stuff is there is all that in the base right now and as you look out into your budget for 19 are there any new big projects whether it be commerce upgrade or some capability some big projects that might cause a jump in sg a as you go through the year john vandemore chief financial officer yes but not those that you ve mentioned and just to be abundantly clear all the projects that we mentioned kind of from the capex side which is everything from the distribution center in china all the way through to consolidating our footprint here in california those are all capital projects for the year so they won t have a direct or not a sizable direct p l impact what will ultimately impact the p l and be visible in categories like sg a will be when we begin consolidating the joint venture that we ve agreed in principle to form in mexico we don t have a good gauge right now on specific timing when we do we ll obviously give some clarity on that but once we begin consolidating those results we will take on board all the sg a all the revenue the gross margin associated with that business again we believe it will be accretive but you will see dollar gains in those categories as we on board those costs outside of that there s really nothing of significance i would call your attention to at this point in time jay sole ubs analyst ok got it thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of jim duffy from stifel please proceed with your question jim duffy stifel financial corp analyst thank you good afternoon everyone very nice profitability in the quarter nice to see that including the sg a leverage john can you maybe spell out the accretion opportunity from the india jv consolidation my understanding is that was a business that was running close to breakeven are you expecting to get to a leverage point there john vandemore chief financial officer yes so i mean just to be abundantly clear on india so it s been a joint venture so it s been fully consolidated in our operation from the get go what you will see now with the acquisition of the minority stake is lower relative takeaway on the minority interest side of things early at the moment but i would say we believe it s probably a couple of pennies on the year obviously that depends entirely on how the business performs and that is another market where we have seen significant fx headwinds but it s contributing so i think it ll probably be a couple of pennies on the year maybe more if things go slightly better than planned jim duffy stifel financial corp analyst ok and then with respect to the gross margin can you speak to what you re seeing from input costs with pardon me with some currency relief in china does that suggest an opportunity into the back half of the year john vandemore chief financial officer we re adjusting input costs on kind of a constant basis almost by shoe if you will so we adjust that as we go we did see some cost alleviation in the quarter that was reflected as i mentioned in some of the domestic wholesale margin numbers but i would probably remark that generally speaking we re not seeing a lot of positives and we re not seeing a lot of negatives we are taking advantage of currencies when we can along the way but you got to keep in mind that that s also bit of a double edged sword because when the currencies move the opposite direction you don t want to give that back so we re conscientious of that in the context of how we develop product so i would say it s been probably a modest to slight net benefit up through this point in time but more on a rolling basis and then keep in mind also that the style mix changes so significantly as you bring new shoes on it s really tough to completely compare that question apples to apples jim duffy stifel financial corp analyst fair enough thank you john vandemore chief financial officer thank you jim operator our next question comes from the line of sam poser from susquehanna please proceed with your question sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my questions a couple of things with the easter shift won t that shift some of your selling expenses from q1 to q2 and also move a good amount of the dtc sales i mean the big will dtc be affected by that john vandemore chief financial officer so on the second part of your question yes the direct to consumer sales are influenced and we ve we factored that into the guidance we ve given as best as we can tell at the moment sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so i was a little confused when you were walking through it i mean how we should think about the direct to consumer sales in the first quarter sort of taking that shift into account you re sort of walking through it david weinberg chief operating officer so in the previous numbers i gave sam we ve already kind of adjusted out what we believe the impact from the easter shift is both in terms of the dtc numbers most significantly in our retail base and elsewhere sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so what i m saying that you sort of walked through how you expect the domestic wholesale and international wholesale and then you add that dtc increase in q1 so i wanted to get a little more clarification on i think you said something about the like mid single in q1 but that seems a bit aggressive given the shift and the comparison gap john vandemore chief financial officer well again where we re going to see the dtc impact most significantly will be in our retail base and as i ve previously mentioned we expect retail right now for q1 to be kind of a high single digit contributor and that includes what we believe to be the impact for the shift of easter into q2 sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so you expect it to increase around 9 like 7 to 9 is that the way to think about it john vandemore chief financial officer for q1 yes david weinberg chief operating officer that includes the new stores as well sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst gotcha and then secondly when you when those when what is the tax rate that you re assuming for the first quarter is it john vandemore chief financial officer yes again we re expecting a range of between 14 and 18 for the full year it should be relatively evenly applied throughout the year absent any discrete tax items changes in law etc so i think at the moment planning for a relatively flat midpoint rate is certainly a decent assumption that being said again we re still looking for regulatory opinions on some aspects of the recently enacted tax law and how those are applied but i d say generally we think that s a reliable estimate at this juncture sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst and in q4 you i mean it looks like your u s profitability was at a rate higher than international so do you expect that to continue into q1 which would likely drive the tax rate a little bit higher john vandemore chief financial officer no we don t think there ll be a meaningful impact on the composition of the revenue streams in q1 that will change that tax guidance sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst and then lastly on india when those 200 plus stores hit your store base how does that impact the sales or is that already in it s just going to change with sales david weinberg chief operating officer that s already in the franchises remain franchises the owned stores remain owned stores when you go in the big shift you ll see is in the minority interest and the share of the profitability and i would say because there was a question that they were unprofitable through this year that the fact is that they did break into profitability last year and we expect that to increase this year sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst thank you very much john john vandemore chief financial officer thanks sam operator our next question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen from b riley fbr please proceed with your question jeff van sinderen b riley fbr analyst first let me add my congratulations and then just to clarify you mentioned stability in sg a in q1 i think do you feel like you have an opportunity to leverage as a percentage of sales later in the year john vandemore chief financial officer yes so just to be abundantly clear about the stability comment i m looking at overall sg a as a percentage of sales and again keeping in mind that a significant portion of in particular the international sg a growth you ve seen recently has been volume driven yes we think we are looking for stability from a kind of rate perspective in the early part of the year i mean there s always opportunities and we re we aggressively pursue those opportunities as they come forward but there s also risks in the business and we want to maintain the ability to respond to those so again i think at the moment what i would probably guide you to is something that is stable as a percentage of sales to last year jeff van sinderen b riley fbr analyst ok fair enough and then how should we think about growth and i know india and mexico have been strong growth areas but maybe you can touch on the growth you re expecting there in 2019 as you kind of are transforming those and then any investments that we should think about that you might need to make in those regions in 2019 john vandemore chief financial officer yes i don t want to get into again country specific growth profiles i ll just point out that india was one of our fastest growing segments countries over the last really two years certainly from a on a percentage basis and continues to perform exceedingly well that was in part our rationale for taking the action we did to bring it in as a wholly owned subsidiary now so we certainly think that there remains significant opportunity to grow that market and we believe that in house it will quite frankly grow faster as a wholly owned subsidiary than it would otherwise be able to grow there may be some modest investments but nothing of the scale that i think would be bear worth calling out at the moment mexico i definitely agree that it s been a good business for us for the brand we believe together with our distribution our existing distribution partner that it can grow faster and better there were probably again be some limited investments there but it will be with an eye toward growing the brand growing the brand presence in the market we ll have better indication on that once we ve an eye toward exactly when we expect the transaction to close but suffice it to say again it was part of the underlying rationale for taking the action we did we felt we could grow it better together in a joint venture format than we d be able to see otherwise so given the attractiveness of that market it will certainly warrant some investment consideration along the way but again nothing of the scale outside of the original investment into the joint venture that i would point out and just to be clear about that it s an operating business today with our distribution partner there are existing stores as we mentioned so in this instance we are buying into to form the joint venture and then grow it from there as partners jeff van sinderen b riley fbr analyst ok understood thanks for taking my questions and best of luck in q1 john vandemore chief financial officer thanks jeff operator our next question comes from the line of chris svezia from wedbush please proceed with your question chris svezia wedbush securities analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the finish to the year david weinberg chief operating officer thanks john vandemore chief financial officer thanks chris chris svezia wedbush securities analyst u s wholesale so i m just curious q4 i think the initial guidance was high single low double you did four and change saw a 5 growth was anything unique happened in the quarter either just i don t know just why did it come in at that level versus maybe what you expected any color about that john vandemore chief financial officer yes i d say what you probably saw a little more continuance of the off price deficit that we have seen in q2 in q3 i mean not extraordinary but it was a little bit weaker than we even thought we re beginning to see new signs of recovery and it didn t come through i think at the level that we had hoped i would also point out that in q4 we were comping against an incredible kids number last year from energy lights it was one of our top five styles last year in q4 and it just had a tough comparable so that was probably a little bit weaker than we anticipated but again i d generally say we were looking for growth in the quarter against kind of the retail backdrop that we saw and some of the traffic numbers that we saw impacting our retail partners that was we still think the growth that we showed was good growth taking advantage of the market and the product strength given those two other considerations i mentioned david weinberg chief operating officer yes and as part of that there s a shift as well from in pricing because the pair information was up mid to high single chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok when i so when i think about you have full sales like authority you talked about maybe flat to down in q1 i guess you make that back up a bit in q2 just any thoughts about how we think about u s wholesale growth for the year seems like kid s has been a little bit softer given the comparison women s i guess depends in what category men s has been strong i guess but just what kind of growth rate we should think about for u s wholesales as we kind of think about the year and moving forward john vandemore chief financial officer yes i mean we sit here with kind of half the year fully vetted with customers and as david pointed out initial orders getting booked now for the back half of the year so it s fairly early to make a full forecast for the year what i would tell you though is we think it s a single digit environment from a domestic wholesale at the moment again against the backdrop of store counts dwindling door counts coming down so i think that s probably the best guide but again i think it s really early and it s tough to tell i would also point out for you just for context we actually saw women s and men s grow this quarter and that was a good sign kid s obviously facing the really difficult comparable given the energy lights phenomena the year before was the only gender category that we saw a decline in the quarter so that was good and reassuring chris svezia wedbush securities analyst and on western europe maybe just talk about what s going on there u k germany some of the other markets broadly speaking take out the currency out of the equation obviously currency is a bit of headwind here near term but what s going on in those markets how has your business been holding up pricing just any color about how we should think about western europe as we go forward david weinberg chief operating officer western europe continues to be a very positive piece for us and we will certainly on a local currency basis grow in the first quarter on top of what s a very good first quarter last year we re actually shipping quite well for january and february we the environment is probably slightly better for growth purposes from germany although the u k will remain our largest u k had some internal issues at the retail level with some bankruptcies and reshuffling and they will continue to grow and they re already the largest to begin with but i would tell you that we would anticipate growth in just about every country in europe on a local currency basis western europe anyway chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok last question i have is just on mexico just any thoughts or can you share with us how big that potentially could be what s the size and i know you haven t disclosed timing but is this sort of a second quarter is it going to happen shortly in the first quarter or just any color about timing on that john vandemore chief financial officer yes we ve been working on it diligently recently we hope that it will close this quarter but it s taking an operating business and forming a joint venture so it s not as easy as starting from scratch because you re dealing with existing components so our anticipation at the moment is that by the end of the quarter we ll be able to close but i would at this point i think quite frankly it s just a little bit too early for us to be able to commit with in any degree of reliability to a timing number chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok and john that s not in your numbers right john vandemore chief financial officer correct we have excluded it from all the guidance at this point in time and we will update you when we have an idea as to the close and we will accordingly update guidance if necessary chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok thank you very much all the best john vandemore chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from the line of omar saad from evercore please proceed with your question unidentified speaker hi guys this is west on for omar a question on your e commerce business you had mentioned you were going to roll out new functionality really put more of an emphasis behind the e commerce can you expand on that a little bit what pieces do you think you really need to improve to really get that business growing kind of in line with some of your peers and then also they re going to be more domestically focused or are there things you re doing abroad as well thank you john vandemore chief financial officer yes i don t want to go into a ton of detail because it s probably too microscopic for everyone but i would say we and actually this started a year ago so or may be even before that really we have been investing in our digital assets our digital capabilities everything from digital marketing all the way through to what will be a complete replatform of our commerce user interface so that s in process it involves for us working with external partners who are expert in this building off of what we have today but creating i think a more comprehensive solution again everything from encompassing everything from digital marketing all the way through to actual e commerce i would characterize it as a focus at the moment on domestic solution but it s with the goal of having as close to a turnkey solution as we can for our global operations so that we can bring similar solutions to our international markets because some of the same trends you re seeing domestically are beginning to emerge internationally with regards to e commerce i just also want to note as an exception to that today china is already far far ahead of many of its competitors and doing exceedingly well in e commerce it grew over 50 this year so when we talk about e commerce it definitely depends on which market you re speaking about but china is already a significant e commerce business for us and continues to do very very well unidentified speaker ok perfect and then just secondly i know you guys have been rolling out more fashion forward product more kind of branding going into specialty and doing some apparel as you think about continuing to build that are you seeing some traction in the brand recognition moving the customer younger any kind of metrics you could have there how it s evolving how the view how the brand overall is viewed domestically and abroad thanks david weinberg chief operating officer we only see more and more increases and more exception more acceptance to the brand i think on a worldwide basis we continue to push the brand and to newer styles and to newer looks and continue to trend significantly younger and it s now beginning to happen in the u s as well so we are all positive about our brand offerings our product offerings and anticipate we will solidify a significantly larger demographic but we are getting more brand acceptance everywhere in the world unidentified speaker that s great good work guys and good luck on the next year david weinberg chief operating officer thanks john vandemore chief financial officer thank you operator our final question comes from the line of tom nikic from wells fargo please proceed with your question tom nikic wells fargo analyst hey everybody thanks for squeezing me in at the end here john just a quick one on the buyback i think you ve already used up a pretty significant portion of the authorization should we assume that you ll sort of keep buying back stock and when it expires you ll look to reup and just kind of thinking how should we think about that thanks john vandemore chief financial officer yes i mean that s almost precisely how we think about it i mean our activity year to date has been a reflection of where we see value and we ve seen tremendous value in the share price skechers as i mentioned we think is undervalued plain and simple so we took the action that was available to us we will continue to pursue completion of the program we have based on the prevailing prices in the market and then we ll go from there i mean it s an ongoing dialog we have with regards to capital allocation so it will definitely be a component of what we talk about with the board going forward and certainly as we near completion of the program that we d put in place last year tom nikic wells fargo analyst all right thanks very much best of luck this year john vandemore chief financial officer thank you tom operator we ve reached the end of the question and answer session and i will now turn the call over to skechers for closing remarks unidentified speaker thank you again for joining us on the call today we would just like to note that today s call may have contained forward

home archives 2006 on 2019 solidarity with venezuela in a changing world by archishman raju the american writer james baldwin once remarked history as nearly no one seems to know is not merely something to be read and it does not refer merely or even principally to the past on the contrary the great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways and history is literally present in all that we do the situation in front of us in venezuela is a reminder of a history that we have seen repeated so many times to be almost weary of it nobody who has been paying any attention to the past several centuries could imagine that what the us wants in venezuela is democracy this word with noble possibilities has been converted into such a farce by the western nations that today the only meaning they attach to it is the unbridled accumulation of wealth surely we must have reached a point where the former director of the cia and the current us secretary of state mike pompeo must at least twitch when he uses it in this particular case the facts are such that were the situation not so serious it would be almost comical luis almagro the head of the organisation of american states based in washington d c recognised a previously unknown figure juan guaido as the president of venezuela before he even recognised himself this was quickly followed by recognition from the united states and the european union the eu reportedly said that the voice of the venezuelan people cannot be ignored but who as baldwin once said for the above named are the people perhaps the eu should instead think carefully of the people in france wearing yellow vests who were out in the streets to be met by the defenders of democracy with military tanks it is not clear what is more stunning the hypocrisy with which white men and women the west or the north in polite language claim to be perfect or the number of people who believe it what is the cause of the economic crisis in venezuela why are millions of venezuelans fleeing the country what about the pictures of empty shelves in grocery stores the answers to these questions are as usual not easy and ultimately a matter for venezuela to resolve through internal debate when published in the new york times or washington post however these questions serve a singular purpose to prepare for american intervention and distract from the real questions that a free media in america should address why does the united states have illegal economic sanctions on venezuela what are the interests of american oil companies in the country with the world s largest oil reserves why does the national security advisor of the president of the united states john bolton refer to the monroe doctrine which asserted in 1823 that the us controlled the hemisphere or god forbid we might ask why the richest nation in the world has so many people living in extreme poverty naturally on these questions there is either deafening silence or vacuous assertions from the aforementioned sources there are particular details of the venezuelan case which must and will be discussed they include the fact that venezuela is oil and mineral rich or more importantly that they nationalised their oil that there is a visible class divide in the pro government poorer and browner and anti government richer and whiter protesters in the photos coming from venezuela and that venezuela has performed an experiment with democratising their economy education and culture called 21st century socialism the reduced oil prices and the sanctions have been crippling to the venezuelan economy this is why the newly appointed venezuelan head of the opec spoke of moving off the dollar and yet perhaps venezuela s case has a much larger significance because it is at the centre of a bigger drama unfolding on the world stage the drama is this we are entering a new stage in history where the american empire is becoming unsustainable this has led to a spectacular political crisis in america certainly one that calls for intervention this is leading to a world where both the cultural and economic power of america no longer remains unchallenged some speak of an emerging multi polar world the economist paul krugman in the new york times compares the situation in america to the fall of the roman empire the economic might of the us is primarily enforced through violence and control of the dollar china which holds the world s largest foreign exchange reserves but is quietly planning to move off the dollar presents the economic challenge the cultural challenge is more diffused but the declining importance of the american media is evidenced by the fact that their own president tells us to distrust them they keep barraging us with news of the russian enemy but nobody can quite understand and they can t seem to explain what russia has actually done it is no surprise then that russia china iran and turkey are among the countries that support the constitutionally elected president of venezuela nicholas maduro by talking of de dollarisation venezuela is repeating the crime for which muammar gaddafi in libya was quietly assassinated the indian government has so far only said that it is closely following the situation this is in contrast to their once open condemnation of imperialism the broader question for the government of india is this will it choose to get closer to a decaying empire or if it will recognise the changing times and look beyond narrow geopolitical conflicts with its neighbours to further south south economic and political cooperation the decline of empires is often very violent as indians know perhaps better than anyone else at this time it is important to revive an old struggle for peace and solidarity when the americans were attacking the vietnamese the majority of the world stood up in solidarity with the latter venezuela is not yet facing such a full scale onslaught but an international solidarity movement is sorely lacking today we must work to revive it and must show our solidarity with venezuela and their elected leader president maduro this is a matter of principle which could have huge consequences in the world that is to come archishman raju is a research fellow in physics and biology at the rockefeller university he is a member of the

fearful of losing nearly 3 billion in subsidies for its expansion in new york city amazon has moved to a new strategy one involving threats the washington post owned by amazon ceo jeff bezos reported on friday that the company is reconsidering its plan to place an office facility for up to 25 000 employees in long island city queens in doing so amazon is signaling that it will squeeze opponents of the deal politically unless they support the massive subsidy package new york city lawmakers who weren t intimately involved with the hq2 bid to bring in amazon have been sharply critical of giving billions in taxpayer dollars to the world s most valuable corporation so it can add to an already existing presence in the region the deal bypassed city council approval adding to the consternation any major multinational would have multiple reasons to expand in new york city given its highly skilled workforce and status as a hub for the technology entertainment and advertising industries all areas where amazon is expanding that makes the billions in subsidies seem gratuitous amazon has been growing into the largest company we ll ever see says jonathan westin of new york communities for change one of the groups leading the charge against the amazon deal the idea that we need to subsidize them in any way blows our mind westin has helped rally opposition to the deal from labor unions community groups and prominent politicians like rep alexandria ocasio cortez whose district is adjacent to the proposed site several other issues have inspired outrage over what critics call the hq2scam even before these subsidies new york city has been struggling to fund acceptable public transportation and affordable housing plus adding 25 000 high paying jobs to this corner of queens will only make gentrification worse activists warn i think anyone who s middle class is not going to be able to live in long island city much longer westin says finally at a city council meeting last week the company refused to agree to remain neutral if amazon workers attempted unionization in new york city a red flag for a labor friendly city the hq2 project has actually split the city s labor movement the retail wholesale and department store union and the teamsters are against the project while the building and construction trades council that would build the hq2 facility and the seiu local 32bj that would staff the building for security and custodial work have come out in favor council speaker corey johnson criticized amazon last week for pitting workers against one another amazon can see its grasp on 2 808 billion in subsidies slipping away this week the state senate recommended the appointment of sen michael gianaris a bitter critic of the deal to the public authorities control board which reviews and approves state based economic development subsidies about 1 5 billion of the grants for hq2 come from the state and could go before this board and the way the board is structured gianaris would have an effective veto over those funds democratic governor andrew cuomo a supporter of the deal who offered to change his name to amazon cuomo if the company agreed to choose new york city would have to approve gianaris but that would create a standoff between the governor and the legislature reflecting the tensions that have accompanied the amazon deal while all of that is happening amazon floated this pullback from new york citing how welcoming politicians in virginia and nashville tennessee have been in handing over public money for its site locations embattled virginia governor ralph northam weathering a scandal over blackface pictures in his medical school yearbook found time to quietly sign off on 750 million in subsidies for a 25 000 employee facility near arlington which the legislature advanced with little opposition nashville is getting a 5 000 person operations center and though the city budget is so strapped public workers were denied a promised raise this week officials passed a 15 million infrastructure grant for the area amazon will occupy the first of 117 million in subsidies for the project amazon is likely threatening this pullout to concentrate minds among new york politicians in an effort to pin blame on them for losing amazon the company is hiring lobbyists and a community affairs manager in new york so it s clearly still committed to the deal at some level amazon may also have a plan b one of the twenty finalists for hq2 was newark new jersey just across the border from new york city it was one of the richest subsidy offers of the entire process up to 7 billion from the city and state to lure amazon the company could certainly skip over to newark and re open talks to place its offices there if only to loosen resistance in new york city whatever the outcome amazon s gambit shows how much the hq2 sweepstakes has backfired what started as a virtual celebration of amazon s prominence has transformed into condemnation over a big company using its clout to extract taxpayer dollars and disrupt communities even michael bloomberg is denouncing tax gifts to amazon more broadly the amazon farce has shone a spotlight on the sordid process of economic development deals which cost cities and states up to 90 billion annually while local services suffer from a lack of funds deals that would receive almost no scrutiny like u s steel winning 47 million in tax breaks from impoverished gary indiana now make headlines by making the spectacle so public amazon may have ruined this gravy train for the rest of corporate america
your voice robert samuelson the washington post let s coin a new law of politics call it neuman s law after alfred e neuman of mad magazine fame whose philosophy is what me worry neuman s law postulates that there is never a good time to raise taxes or cut federal spending this explains why since 1961 the annual federal budget has been in deficit 52 times and in surplus only five times 1969 and 1998 2001 unsurprisingly all the surpluses occurred at the end of economic booms that automatically raised tax revenues and curtailed spending the latest champions of neuman s law are lawrence summers treasury secretary under president clinton and director of the national economic council under president obama and jason furman the last chairman of the white house council of economic advisers under obama both are economists both teach at harvard writing in foreign affairs published by the council on foreign relations summers and furman discuss the budget outlook in great detail throwing hordes of facts and figures at readers but their conclusion corroborates neuman s law deficits should not cause policymakers much concern at least for now they write it s time for washington to put away its debt obsession they conclude obsession they must be kidding this inverts the truth if washington feared debt congress would long ago have tamed budget deficits deficits are the annual gap between federal revenues and spending debt is the accumulation of all past deficits what both democrats and republicans actually fear are the highly unpopular steps spending cuts or tax increases they might have to take to reduce or eliminate the deficits which are huge the congressional budget office s latest baseline estimate for 2019 is nearly 900 billion this equals 4 2 percent of the economy gross domestic product and 20 percent of federal spending so why bother ask furman and summers deficits aren t now doing the economy much harm interest rates are low and may well stay that way if deficits are cut too abruptly the present economic expansion could falter these are possibilities but doing nothing also poses dangers as even summers and furman concede higher debt levels could make it hard for future governments to stimulate the economy in a downturn they say if escalating debt raises interest rates it could crowd out private investment undermining the economy s long term growth potential or some sort of financial crisis might occur if investors become sated with u s treasury bonds curiously furman and summers say that we can t simply borrow indefinitely as much as we d like the debt cannot be allowed to grow forever they write the government cannot set budget policy without any limiting principles or guides as to what is and what is not possible or desirable they say at one point at another they warn sooner or later government spending has to be paid for but what are the limiting principles and when and how might government spending be paid for they don t say their promises are vague rhetorical throwaway lines that in isolation have no credibility to be fair there is brief mention of a proposal to accept the existing increases in government debt but insist that any new spending or tax cuts not raise the debt further details are few and this provides little restraint in 2018 the federal debt held by the public was 78 percent of gdp more than double the 35 percent in 2007 the cbo projects that under present policies it will be 93 percent of gdp in 2029 and rising no one really knows the long term effects of these continuously large deficits but there is a crude analogy in the recent past that provides a warning double digit inflation consumer prices went from about 1 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 1980 many economists argued then that a little more inflation wouldn t harm the economy but a little more soon became a lot more and only the harsh 1980 82 downturn peak unemployment 10 8 percent brought it under control it s doubtful that summers and furman will be much impressed by neuman s law but they are living proof of its power the message that a reasonable person would take from their essay is that the government can borrow unlimited amounts for the foreseeable future this also seems to be the position of the trump administration the essay s true purpose seems to be to provide intellectual support for what self interested politicians would do in any case enjoy present pleasures and postpone any future unpleasantness let someone else worry about the future that s neuman s law and it s mad robert samuelson is a columnist for the washington post
in his masterpiece killing hope u s military and c i a interventions since world war ii william blum who died in december 2018 wrote chapter length accounts of 55 u s regime change operations against countries around the world from china 1945 1960s to haiti 1986 1994 noam chomsky s blurb on the back of the latest edition says simply far and away the best book on the topic we agree if you have not read it please do it will give you a clearer context for what is happening in venezuela today and a better understanding of the world you are living in since killing hope was published in 1995 the u s has conducted at least 13 more regime change operations several of which are still active yugoslavia afghanistan iraq the 3rd u s invasion of haiti since wwii somalia honduras libya syria ukraine yemen iran nicaragua and now venezuela william blum noted that the u s generally prefers what its planners call low intensity conflict over full scale wars only in periods of supreme overconfidence has it launched its most devastating and disastrous wars from korea and vietnam to afghanistan and iraq after its war of mass destruction in iraq the u s reverted to low intensity conflict under obama s doctrine of covert and proxy war obama conducted even heavier bombing than bush ii and deployed u s special operations forces to 150 countries all over the world but he made sure that nearly all the bleeding and dying was done by afghans syrians iraqis somalis libyans ukrainians yemenis and others not by americans what u s planners mean by low intensity conflict is that it is less intense for americans president ghani of afghanistan recently revealed that a staggering 45 000 afghan security forces have been killed since he took office in 2014 compared with only 72 u s and nato troops it shows who has been doing the fighting ghani caustically remarked this disparity is common to every current u s war this does not mean that the u s is any less committed to trying to overthrowing governments that reject and resist u s imperial sovereignty especially if those countries contain vast oil reserves it s no coincidence that two of the main targets of current u s regime change operations are iran and venezuela two of the four countries with the largest liquid oil reserves in the world the others being saudi arabia and iraq in practice low intensity conflict involves four tools of regime change sanctions or economic warfare propaganda or information warfare covert and proxy war and aerial bombardment in venezuela the u s has used the first and second with the third and fourth now on the table since the first two have created chaos but so far not toppled the government the u s government has been opposed to venezuela s socialist revolution since the time hugo chavez was elected in 1998 unbeknownst to most americans chavez was well loved by poor and working class venezuelans for his extraordinary array of social programs that lifted millions out of poverty between 1996 and 2010 the level of extreme poverty plummeted from 40 to 7 the government also substantially improved healthcare and education cutting infant mortality by half reducing the malnutrition rate from 21 to 5 of the population and eliminating illiteracy these changes gave venezuela the lowest level of inequality in the region based on its gini coefficient since chavez death in 2013 venezuela has descended into an economic crisis stemming from a combination of government mismanagement corruption sabotage and the precipitous fall in the price of oil the oil industry provides 95 of venezuela s exports so the first thing venezuela needed when prices crashed in 2014 was international financing to cover huge shortfalls in the budgets of both the government and the national oil company the strategic objective of u s sanctions is to exacerbate the economic crisis by denying venezuela access to the u s dominated international financial system to roll over existing debt and obtain new financing the blocking of citgo s funds in the u s also deprives venezuela of a billion dollars per year in revenue that it previously received from the export refining and retail sale of gasoline to american drivers canadian economist joe emersberger has calculated that the new sanctions trump unleashed in 2017 cost venezuela 6 billion in just their first year in sum u s sanctions are designed to make the economy scream in venezuela exactly as president nixon described the goal of u s sanctions against chile after its people elected salvador allende in 1970 alfred de zayas visited venezuela as a un rapporteur in 2017 and wrote an in depth report for the un he criticized venezuela s dependence on oil poor governance and corruption but he found that economic warfare by the u s and its allies were seriously exacerbating the crisis modern day economic sanctions and blockades are comparable with medieval sieges of towns de zayas wrote twenty first century sanctions attempt to bring not just a town but sovereign countries to their knees he recommended that the international criminal court should investigate u s sanctions against venezuela as crimes against humanity in a recent interview with the independent newspaper in the u k de zayas reiterated that u s sanctions are killing venezuelans venezuela s economy has shrunk by about half since 2014 the greatest contraction of a modern economy in peacetime the world health organization who reported that the average venezuelan lost an incredible 24 lb in body weight in 2017 mr de zayas successor as un rapporteur idriss jazairy issued a statement on january 31st in which he condemned coercion by outside powers as a violation of all norms of international law sanctions which can lead to starvation and medical shortages are not the answer to the crisis in venezuela mr jazairy said precipitating an economic and humanitarian crisis is not a foundation for the peaceful settlement of disputes while venezuelans face poverty preventable diseases malnutrition and open threats of war by u s officials those same u s officials and their corporate sponsors are looking at an almost irresistible gold mine if they can bring venezuela to its knees a fire sale of its oil industry to foreign oil companies and the privatization of many other sectors of its economy from hydroelectric power plants to iron aluminum and yes actual gold mines this is not speculation it is what the u s s new puppet juan guaido has reportedly promised his american backers if they can overthrow venezuela s elected government and install him in the presidential palace oil industry sources have reported that guaido has plans to introduce a new national hydrocarbons law that establishes flexible fiscal and contractual terms for projects adapted to oil prices and the oil investment cycle a new hydrocarbons agency would be created to offer bidding rounds for projects in natural gas and conventional heavy and extra heavy crude the u s government claims to be acting in the best interests of the venezuelan people but over 80 percent of venezuelans including many who don t support maduro are opposed to the crippling economic sanctions while 86 oppose u s or international military intervention this generation of americans has already seen how our government s endless sanctions coups and wars have only left country after country mired in violence poverty and chaos as the results of these campaigns have become predictably catastrophic for the people of each country targeted the american officials promoting and carrying them out have a higher and higher bar to meet as they try to answer the obvious question of an increasingly skeptical u s and international public how is venezuela or iran or north korea different from iraq afghanistan libya syria and at least 63 other countries where u s regime change operations have led only to long lasting violence and chaos mexico uruguay the vatican and many other countries are committed to diplomacy to help the people of venezuela resolve their political differences and find a peaceful way forward the most valuable way that the u s can help is to stop making the venezuelan economy and people scream on all sides by lifting its sanctions and abandoning its failed and catastrophic regime change operation in venezuela but the only things that will force such a radical change in u s policy are public outrage education and organizing and international solidarity with the people of venezuela this article was produced by local peace economy a project of the independent

what s a nigerian citizen to do when there s a presidential election coming up and the two leading candidates are a former dictator who s presided over four years of lackluster growth and an alleged kleptocrat of international repute this is the choice facing africa s largest oil producer and by some measures its largest economy in the feb 16 vote although the field is crowded incumbent muhammadu buhari 76 faces his strongest challenge from atiku abubakar 72 who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007 and has tried and failed several times already to secure the top job buhari who led nigeria briefly in the 1980s as a dictator came back to power four years ago via the ballot box after military rule ended in 1999 he contested several elections unsuccessfully before finally becoming the first opposition figure to win the presidency he describes himself as a converted democrat voters and pundits alike were optimistic that he could diversify the oil dependent economy tackle graft and end boko haram s deadly insurgency while the stern former general has succeeded in stamping out some of the corruption that s long blighted nigeria critics say he s been selective mostly targeting his political opponents they also say he s failed on other issues nicknaming him baba go slow in reference to his age and sluggish response to crises nigeria s economy is still smaller on a per capita basis than it was in 2014 when it was hammered by the crash in crude prices unemployment has surged to a record 23 percent from 6 4 percent at the end of 2014 the stock market has been the world s worst performer since buhari came to office falling more than 50 percent in dollar terms boko haram militants some affiliated with islamic state continue to wreak havoc in the northeast other parts of the country have been roiled by a conflict between farmers and herders that s led to thousands of deaths abubakar widely known as atiku is a father of 26 who has business interests ranging from oil and gas services to food manufacturing he s pledged to loosen the state s grip on the economy end the naira s peg to the dollar and privatize companies including the nigerian national petroleum corp which dominates the local energy industry but for all his market friendly talk he admires the late conservative u k prime minister margaret thatcher many nigerians think he used his past positions in government to enrich himself it s like a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea says andrew niagwan 36 a teacher in the central city of jos who doesn t know if he ll vote buhari s got good intentions but he doesn t seem very capable our living standards have dropped in recent years as for atiku nigerians are wary because of all the allegations surrounding him a u s senate report in 2010 concluded that abubakar and one of his wives had wired 40 million of suspect funds into american accounts and said that his business dealings raise a host of questions about the nature and source of his wealth although he has denied the claims and has never been indicted at home or abroad abubakar hasn t been able to shake the perception of impropriety in january he met with lawmakers in washington after having been banned from the country for more than a decade under a state department edict against politicians linked to foreign corruption according to former u s officials a spokesperson for abubakar s campaign denies he d been banned from the u s and the state department declined to comment on the visit investors expect nigerian assets to rise if abubakar wins as much as buhari has done in terms of tackling corruption under his guidance the economy has been quite stagnant says christopher dielmann an economist at exotix capital in london the perception is that under atiku a degree of corruption could return to the country but that might bring with it higher economic growth still any bounce could be short lived abubakar may not risk the political fallout from trying to sell state assets or as he s also promised removing a cap that keeps nigeria s gasoline prices among the cheapest in the world i m doubtful there d be any great change with the economy no matter who gets elected says john campbell a former u s ambassador to nigeria who s now a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations in washington that s a major problem he says as the united nations projects nigeria s population will double to 410 million by 2050 how on earth can you grow an economy fast enough to accommodate those numbers new york based risk consultant eurasia group which included nigeria on its list of the top 10 global risks for 2019 predicts buhari will be re elected but even if steadier oil prices mean the worst is over it won t be an easy four years the country might just muddle through for now says amaka anku head of africa at eurasia the next election in 2023 could be an inflection point she says there s a real chance that a reformist government emerges then
last week the us formally adopted sanctions on venezuelan national oil company pdvsa as well as on citgo its us based distribution arm as part of its press for regime change in caracas national security advisor john bolton estimated the actions would affect some 7 billion in assets and would block 11 billion in revenue to the venezuelan government over the next year the state department was quick to add these new sanctions do not target the innocent people of venezuela but of course they do the wall street journal reported the sanctions could create deeper gasoline shortages in venezuela the country s refineries are already operating at a fraction of their capacity crippled by a lack of spare parts and crude venezuela only produced a third of the 190 000 barrels of gasoline it consumed a day as of november according to ivan freites a leader of the country s oil union immediately it s going to hurt the average venezuelan mr freites said meanwhile the new york times noted but just across the street a group of senior citizens waiting in line to collect their pensions worried that the trump administration s actions would further bankrupt their country and deepen the humanitarian crisis that has left so many starving sick and without basic services the united states has no business meddling in this said aura ramos 59 a retiree who can barely afford blood pressure medicine it s the regular people who will be affected the washington office on latin america released a statement criticizing the announced sanctions writing however we are deeply concerned at the potential for the recently announced u s sanctions to intensify the severe hardships and suffering that millions of venezuelans are enduring venezuelans are already facing widespread scarcities of essential medicines and basic goods venezuela s oil exports represent the main source of hard currency used to pay for imports without this revenue it is clear that the importation of food and medicine could be put at risk in turn this will further accelerate a migration and refugee crisis that has strained neighboring countries and put many of the over 3 million venezuelan migrants and refugees at risk it appears as though there is increasing acceptance of the basic fact that the us sanctions on venezuela will have a negative impact on the people of venezuela but all this analysis misses two important points first the trump administration had already imposed broad economic sanctions in 2017 though apparently both the wall street journal and new york times were unaware of this development from the same wsj article this week s sanctions mark the first targeting of venezuela s lifeblood industry which accounts for nearly all of the country s hard currency income until now u s sanctions were largely limited to individuals in venezuela s regime another example from a nyt article a few days earlier the oil sanctions amount to the first punitive action taken by the united states against mr maduro since the power struggle in caracas erupted last week and it is intended to starve the government of mr maduro of cash and foreign currency oil production in venezuela has already plummeted because of mismanagement and poor policies and the country s economy is in shambles these examples are certainly not alone in their misunderstanding of the sanctions and their impact on the oil industry but it s not terribly difficult to find information on the impact of the 2017 sanctions venezuelan economist francisco rodríguez provided a useful analysis last year explaining just this and it is even in english rodríguez s basic story the oil industry is critical to the venezuelan government underinvestment and the rapid decline in oil prices caused a significant drop in revenue then as oil prices began increasing trump imposed sanctions making any international financial transaction extremely difficult and potentially toxic rodríguez explains using this graph of oil production in venezuela and colombia how venezuelan and colombian oil production both declined at the same rate until the trump financial embargo was implemented in august 2017 then venezuela s oil production collapsed it is striking that the second change in trend in venezuela s production numbers occurs at the time at which the united states decided to impose financial sanctions on venezuela executive order 13 808 issued on august 25 of 2017 barred u s persons from providing new financing to the venezuelan government or pdvsa although the order carved out allowances for commercial credit of less than 90 days it stopped the country from issuing new debt or selling previously issued debt currently in its possession the executive order is part of a broader process of what one could term the toxification of financial dealings with venezuela during 2017 it became increasingly clear that institutions who decided to enter into financial arrangements with venezuela would have to be willing to pay high reputational and regulatory costs this was partly the result of a strategic decision by the venezuelan opposition in itself a response to the growing authoritarianism of the maduro government it s not just the the media s apparent amnesia with regard to those 2017 sanctions and their impact on the oil industry that is the problem here in fact the impact of those sanctions was even larger as my colleague mark weisbrot has previously explained and as rodríguez notes in the same article linked above the sanctions made it virtually impossible for the venezuela government to take the measures necessary to eliminate hyperinflation or recover from a deep depression such measures would include debt restructuring and creating a new exchange rate system exchange rate bases stabilization in which the currency would normally be pegged to the dollar but it actually gets worse when the us first announced its recognition of juan guaidó as president of venezuela on january 23 the decision was met largely with applause within the foreign policy establishment it seemed like nobody bothered to think about what practically and economically the decision would mean since trump s election and his increasingly threatening rhetoric in relation to venezuela there has been wide agreement that a full scale oil embargo would be terrible both for venezuela and the us yet somehow hardly anyone realized that by recognizing guaidó the us was de facto putting an oil embargo in place once again we turn to rodríguez who for what it s worth has been publicly supportive of the decision to recognize guaidó and wrote the following on january 28 a day before the most recently announced sanctions by giving it the legal authority to invoice venezuelan oil the decision to recognize the guaidó administration therefore would have the same implications for bilateral trade of an oil embargo applied by the countries that provide for nearly three fourths of venezuela s imports the decisions can be expected to have a significant effect on the country s capacity both to produce oil and import goods as a result we expect venezuela s oil production to decline by 640tbd to 508tbd in 2019 a fall of 55 7 as opposed to our prior forecast of 1 070tbd exports will fall to usd 13 5bn usd 12 3bn from oil nearly half our previous estimate of usd 23 8bn imports of goods will decline to usd 7 0bn a 40 3 decline we expect the entrance of some humanitarian aid as well as the default on payments of all debt to cushion the fall venezuela s economy is highly import dependent as illustrated by the strong empirical correlation between import and gdp growth as a result of the additional import crunch we expect venezuela s economy to contract by 26 4 as opposed to our previous forecast of 11 7 the impact is clear the decision to formally recognize guaidó will have a massive economic impact on the people of venezuela irrespective of sanctions oil embargos or whatever else is announced the trump administration succeeded in de facto implementing an oil embargo without taking any of the heat they would have if it were done explicitly and then this week the trump administration announced broader trade sanctions that appeared to make explicit by the recognition of a parallel government with some specific carve outs for american oil companies already in venezuela like chevron and halliburton of course there are plenty of people who will argue that this pain and suffering is worth it in order to force maduro from power that s their right but the media should force them to make that argument openly and honestly confront the pain and suffering these policies will inflict finally if asking for the media to get the sanctions story right is too much maybe they can give some coverage to the fact that national security advisor john bolton went on national tv and openly said the following it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela it would be good for the people of venezuela it would be good for the people of the united states we both have a lot at stake here making this come out the right way a decimated oil industry in the nation with the largest proven oil reserves in the world would appear to serve some alternative interests beyond democracy and human rights reposted from cepr net francisco rodríguez ecuador venezuela this week torino economics and torino capital group company january 28 2019
democrat alexandria ocasio cortez celebrated news that amazon may be reconsidering building a headquarters in new york city after a furious backlash over the purported tax breaks they would receive ocasio cortez 29 had been a strong opponent of the plans citing the rent hikes and local displacement as seen around the tech firm s headquarters in seattle as grounds for why the city should reject the proposal after a litany of local opposition amazon is now said to be considering pulling the plug on its plans to open a new headquarters in the queens borough potentially jeopardizing 25 000 new jobs in the city ocasio cortez responded tweeting can everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world s biggest corporations yes they can scroll down for videos congresswoman elect alexandria ocasio cortez a self proclaimed democratic socialist whose district is adjacent to long island city spoke out to decry the deal to bring an amazon campus to queens in a tweet on friday the freshman us representative urged everyday people to fight back against amazon s plans the online retailer has not yet purchased or leased any land for the multi billion dollar project which would allow it to withdraw the plans easily an anonymous source told the washington post according to the source amazon executives have allegedly held internal discussions recently to reassess the situation in new york and explore alternative sites the reported change of heart coincided with amazon s share prices falling around 2 4 percent on friday in november the jeff bezos owned firm revealed it would branching out from its home base in seattle and unveiled new york city and arlington as the lucky suitors of its 50 000 combined job plan the retailer said it planned to spend 5billion on the two new developments and hoped to get more than 2billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more at the time new york governor andrew cuomo lauded the announcement as an economic triumph but critics hounded the state for providing too many subsidies in order to sanction the deal this november photos from long island city shows the area amazon had planned to take over for their new york headquarters amazon has mailed flyers to queens residents touting the economic and employment benefits of its new york expansion hoping to blunt opposition but protests still persisted a critic of the plan queens state senator michael gianaris was appointed to a panel charged with approving the new amazon campus and has the power to block the plan last week city council members challenged amazon company executives for a second time at a public hearing where activists jeered and booed holding anti amazon placards cuomo lambasted gianaris and other members of the new york senate for their short sighted view of amazon s potential impact on the borough and beyond for the state senate to oppose amazon was governmental malpractice and if they stop amazon from coming to new york they re going to have the people of new york state to explain it to he said i ve never seen a more absurd situation where political pandering and obvious pandering so defeats a bonafide economic development project we incentivized amazon to come as we incentivize every big business to come you know what the incentive package was we get 27 billion in revenue they get 3 billion back i would do that all day long amazon announced after a yearlong search that it would split its hq2 between arlington virginia outside the us capital and the long island city neighborhood in the new york borough of queens above a demonstrator holds a sign at a rally to protest amazon s new location workplace in long island city in queens the social media message came as a follow up to her previous comments from when the proposal was initially unveiled amazon is a billion dollar company she wrote in november the idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment not less is extremely concerning to residents here the following month city council speaker corey johnson echoed ocasio cortez s sentiments we have a crumbling subway system record homelessness public housing that is in crisis overcrowded schools sick people without health insurance and an escalating affordable crisis he said is anyone asking if we should be giving nearly 3billion in public money to the world s richest company the alleged leak was thought to possibly be a ploy by the e commerce behemoth to negotiate even more favorable terms at the eleventh hour the world s largest online retailer plans to spend 5 billion on two new developments in long island city in queens and in arlington virginia and expects to get more than 2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more but in a statement to cnn amazon denied they were considering revoking the hq2 plans we re focused on engaging with our new neighbors small business owners educators and community leaders whether it s building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of new york city students we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be according to the new york times amazon executives are fearful over the uncertainty of the plans with regard to the senate having already made significant investments of money and time they haven t however made any contingencies plans for a potential plan b should their proposal suddenly be blocked the split second headquarters which amazon called hq2 attracted 238 proposals from across north america in a year long bidding war that garnered widespread publicity for the company amazon ended the frenzy by dividing the spoils between the two most powerful u s east coast cities and offering a consolation prize of a 5 000 person center in nashville tennessee amazon was met with disapproval and opposition this photo is from a january protest at the outset of its search last year amazon said it was looking for a business friendly environment buried in the 32 page proposal was also a controversial clause allowing the company to build a roof top helipad which have been banned in the city since 9 11 according to slate amazon s agreement with new york doesn t require the company to contribute any funds to the city s ailing subway system it does however include a clause requiring them to make payments in lieu of property taxes which at least half of which will be invested in the infrastructure fund overseen by the new york city economic development corporation the fund will support projects including but not limited to streets sidewalks utility relocations environmental remediation public open space transportation schools and signage around the eventual headquarter site the company said it will receive performance based incentives of 1 525billion from the state of new york including an average 48 000 for each job it creates it can also apply for other tax incentives such as new york city s relocation and employment assistance program that offers tax breaks potentially worth 900 million over 12 years what benefit the company would actually get was unclear in november president trump renewed his assault on the retail giant and warned new york lawmakers they may regret showing bezos company so much leniency they re giving up a lot they re expensive deals only time will tell maybe amazon will have massive competition and they won t be the same company in five years in which case it would be a big mistake trump told the daily caller amazon wasn t the only online giant to cement its future in america s financial captial in december google said it would invest more than 1billion on a new campus in new york creating thousands of jobs
this does not mean that the u s is any less committed to trying to overthrowing governments that reject and resist u s imperial sovereignty especially if those countries contain vast oil reserves it s no coincidence that two of the main targets of current u s regime change operations are iran and venezuela two of the four countries with the largest liquid oil reserves in the world the others being saudi arabia and iraq in practice low intensity conflict involves four tools of regime change sanctions or economic warfare propaganda or information warfare covert and proxy war and aerial bombardment in venezuela the u s has used the first and second with the third and fourth now on the table since the first two have created chaos but so far not toppled the government the u s government has been opposed to venezuela s socialist revolution since the time hugo chavez was elected in 1998 unbeknownst to most americans chavez was well loved by poor and working class venezuelans for his extraordinary array of social programs that lifted millions out of poverty between 1996 and 2010 the level of extreme poverty plummeted from 40 to 7 the government also substantially improved healthcare and education cutting infant mortality by half reducing the malnutrition rate from 21 to 5 of the population and eliminating illiteracy these changes gave venezuela the lowest level of inequality in the region based on its gini coefficient since chavez death in 2013 venezuela has descended into an economic crisis stemming from a combination of government mismanagement corruption sabotage and the precipitous fall in the price of oil the oil industry provides 95 of venezuela s exports so the first thing venezuela needed when prices crashed in 2014 was international financing to cover huge shortfalls in the budgets of both the government and the national oil company the strategic objective of u s sanctions is to exacerbate the economic crisis by denying venezuela access to the u s dominated international financial system to roll over existing debt and obtain new financing the blocking of citgo s funds in the u s also deprives venezuela of a billion dollars per year in revenue that it previously received from the export refining and retail sale of gasoline to american drivers canadian economist joe emersberger has calculated that the new sanctions trump unleashed in 2017 cost venezuela 6 billion in just their first year in sum u s sanctions are designed to make the economy scream in venezuela exactly as president nixon described the goal of u s sanctions against chile after its people elected salvador allende in 1970 alfred de zayas visited venezuela as a un rapporteur in 2017 and wrote an in depth report for the un he criticized venezuela s dependence on oil poor governance and corruption but he found that economic warfare by the u s and its allies were seriously exacerbating the crisis modern day economic sanctions and blockades are comparable with medieval sieges of towns de zayas wrote twenty first century sanctions attempt to bring not just a town but sovereign countries to their knees he recommended that the international criminal court should investigate u s sanctions against venezuela as crimes against humanity in a recent interview with the independent newspaper in the u k de zayas reiterated that u s sanctions are killing venezuelans venezuela s economy has shrunk by about half since 2014 the greatest contraction of a modern economy in peacetime the world health organization who reported that the average venezuelan lost an incredible 24 lb in body weight in 2017 mr de zayas successor as un rapporteur idriss jazairy issued a statement on january 31st in which he condemned coercion by outside powers as a violation of all norms of international law sanctions which can lead to starvation and medical shortages are not the answer to the crisis in venezuela mr jazairy said precipitating an economic and humanitarian crisis is not a foundation for the peaceful settlement of disputes while venezuelans face poverty preventable diseases malnutrition and open threats of war by u s officials those same u s officials and their corporate sponsors are looking at an almost irresistible gold mine if they can bring venezuela to its knees a fire sale of its oil industry to foreign oil companies and the privatization of many other sectors of its economy from hydroelectric power plants to iron aluminum and yes actual gold mines this is not speculation it is what the u s s new puppet juan guaido has reportedly promised his american backers if they can overthrow venezuela s elected government and install him in the presidential palace oil industry sources have reported that guaido has plans to introduce a new national hydrocarbons law that establishes flexible fiscal and contractual terms for projects adapted to oil prices and the oil investment cycle a new hydrocarbons agency would be created to offer bidding rounds for projects in natural gas and conventional heavy and extra heavy crude the u s government claims to be acting in the best interests of the venezuelan people but over 80 percent of venezuelans including many who don t support maduro are opposed to the crippling economic sanctions while 86 oppose u s or international military intervention this generation of americans has already seen how our government s endless sanctions coups and wars have only left country after country mired in violence poverty and chaos as the results of these campaigns have become predictably catastrophic for the people of each country targeted the american officials promoting and carrying them out have a higher and higher bar to meet as they try to answer the obvious question of an increasingly skeptical u s and international public how is venezuela or iran or north korea different from iraq afghanistan libya syria and at least 63 other countries where u s regime change operations have led only to long lasting violence and chaos mexico uruguay the vatican and many other countries are committed to diplomacy to help the people of venezuela resolve their political differences and find a peaceful way forward the most valuable way that the u s can help is to stop making the venezuelan economy and people scream on all sides by lifting its sanctions and abandoning its failed and catastrophic regime change operation in venezuela but the only things that will force such a radical change in u s policy are public outrage education and organizing and international solidarity with the people of venezuela

the coherence and signature represented by six modi budgets is in the emphasis given to long term nation building and modernisation over populist sops this has given us the good macroeconomic profile and the international recognition of an economy on the move writes gautam mukherjee people think that a liar gains a victory over his victim ayn rand in atlas shrugged a farewell budget that lays out a 10 year roadmap and a pot of gold 10 trillion strong at 13 years from now is unusual to say the least if you think of 2032 when most of our 65 per cent of the population that is under 35 will be around remember 10 trillion puts you in the top three economies of the world in nominal terms and probably at the very top in ppp terms this is due to india s 7 8 per cent gdp growth per annum year on year compounding away and expected to power on for the next 30 years no other major economy can hope for as much with the near certainty that we can of course it presupposes that the great indian electorate does not plunge this country into chaos by throwing a spanner in the works narendra modi s audacity is in his assumption of continuity he is banking on the good sense of the electorate to see him through and very deftly he has moved the time dial for himself forward in 2014 he used to speak of the need for 10 years to get many things done at the end of the first five he wants health and god willing a further 13 years some two and a half terms to retirement or worthy lotus branded successor there is no pleading or grandstanding congress style of if we are voted back to power and this weeks before the declaration of dates for the general elections 2019 and in the face of a howling cacophony of an opposition contemplating a life of irrelevance and powerlessness the whole country registered the point that modi thinks he has done well because he has not hesitated to list his government s achievements so far but he also needs more time to see his vision through to its logical conclusion given that the other side had nearly six decades most of them mired in low growth scarcity and poverty it seems like a very reasonable implied request indeed the foreign media was quick to join a chorus of domestic observers that called it a campaign budget because it tried to include over 70 per cent or more of the electorate in its reach it was campaign promise yes but also an american style state of the union address and a vision statement besides being at its minimum the usual set of proposals towards the annual accounting exercise the new nsso data on jobs on which the opposition has jumped with all the vigour of a pack of ravenous hyenas is clearly spurious resignation of its authors notwithstanding this talk of a 45 year high in unemployment is absurd because 45 years ago this country in the sadistic grip of the licence permit raj and minus growth rates was barely allowed to manufacture a sling shot it therefore reads like an old soviet crop report in its exaggeration and inaccuracy the half baked nsso report was leaked just before the tabling of the interim budget on february 1 despite being disallowed by the government it has clearly done no more than a shoddy job of surveying the formal economy that the private sector in it mostly benefited by the congress and its payola systems and in a sulk ever since it was booted out along with a mostly unproductive public sector is not the whole truth is obvious the formal private sector deprived of loans they understood they were not required to pay back leading to a massive bad debt problems at all the public sector and some private sector banks has indeed not grown much the informal economy however which is at 80 90 per cent of the whole and fuels the robust gdp growth too is ignored by the lazy babus at the nsso who can t be bothered to survey and enumerate it but this cannot be ignored with impunity certainly not without serious distortions of data because it the domestic service the self employed small entrepreneur the street vendor the drivers helpers cooks guards construction site workers chowkidars even is growing much faster than the formal economy along with it are the poorly documented small and medium enterprises estimated to employ some 200 million people at least in this budget this msme sector has been given an interest subvention of 2 per cent for loans up to rs 1 crore the broad informal sector has been offered a small monthly pension of rs 3 000 per month after the age of 60 it is a benefit that will accrue to millions of people this comes on top of other insurance schemes for the poor announced earlier including those for medical insurance life and accident insurance in addition to bank accounts aadhaar based identity authentication and a massive thrust towards digitisation the insurance vehicles are definitely a modi favourite the larger benefit for the country is the inclusion of the same millions who work in these sectors on the statistical rolls we will know who these people are where they work as the pension scheme identifies millions of workers for eligibility they can qualify for the scheme only by making a monthly contribution of between rs 55 100 depending on age it will be therefore to an extent self supporting like most insurance schemes are in this interim budget as a whole there was the careful balancing act of distributing sops incentives and largesse without impacting the admirable fiscal deficit number as it stands certainly not by more than 0 1 per cent even projected into next year this was made possible by a doubling of direct tax collections for the very first time it was a budget that was responsive to the needs of various sections of the population and thanked the taxpayer a first for any indian government for enabling the development programmes of this administration to go forward the modi government presented via a stand in finance minister who is also the railway minister what might have been a vote on account that is if it was an administration with less self confidence and more reverence for convention minister piyush goyal young fit fluently bilingual in hindi and english presented a substantial budget through a long speech prime minister narendra modi was there thumping the table along with his colleagues on the treasury benches in repeated approval of many of the announcements that were made the media and the middle classes saw to it that the best received announcement bar none was the one that exempted up to rs 5 lakh in taxable income from income tax it will benefit an estimated three crore people and there were hints that people in higher tax brackets might also see some relief when the budget proposals are confirmed after the elections this even as a small payment of rs 6 000 per annum to farmers who own less than five acres of land has nevertheless remembered another 12 crore people this too like the pension scheme for the informal sector will help identify by name aadhaar card and bank account some 12 crore people who qualify and will also improve our statistical abilities states will need to cooperate by supplying much of the information from their land records but the uses of this captured information will be handy for other benefits too as they roll out in future the congress was quick to mock at this one announced early in the budget speech seeing their plank of being the farmers champion melting away at just rs 17 a day rahul gandhi called it an insult to the indian farmer internet wags promptly mocked him on social media calling it 0 02 paise per second this even as the bjp said the states particularly the congress ruled ones were at liberty to enhance the amounts to the extent that their purse and conscience could afford this was probably in oblique reference to the already floundering farm loan waiver schemes announced by the congress in the three hindi heartland states they have recently won as well as in karnataka this token amount of course comes on top of other benefits such as minimum price guarantees for produce subsidised fertiliser and low cost loans and interest waivers also extended by this budget to those in fisheries poultry and dairy industries the moribund real estate sector that accounts for at least 10 per cent of the gdp ignored for the entirety of the modi government so far despite being a significant employer has at last been given some benefits perhaps the government saw its relentless emphasis on infrastructure development in preparation for facilitating a 10 trillion economy as attention enough however the housing office retail shopping centres and so on are definitely a distinct largely urban area category and deserve encouragement having seen the light on this at last the present budget moves on relief in notional rents from second homes it also includes long term capital gains from property concessions this permits buying two homes after the sale of one to a capital gains value of rs 2 crore without attracting any tax but only once in a lifetime there were a number of efficiency oriented announcements including income tax assessments and refunds within a day digitised and anonymous scrutiny single window clearances for domestic filmmakers and a massive push for furthering the digital in general as a tool to curb corruption and increase efficiency bank fixed deposits might experience a revival because the tds threshold has been raised from applicability at just rs 10 000 earned to rs 40 000 the opposition was visibly upset at a near full budget instead of a mere vote on account and whined about this for a day or two after the one hour 45 minute presentation by goyal it was nevertheless called a good budget by experts the captains of business and industry the ordinary people the stock market and the media various congress party grandees including the gandhis sat on in parliament through goyal s cheerful speech making faces as if they were suffering the full rigours of purgatory undaunted the budget laid out a 10 point vision statement it wants to build physical infrastructure fit for a 10 trillion economy this cannot be faulted because infrastructure bottlenecks have hampered our progress for decades and stigmatised india as a third world country modi also wants a fully digital economy by 2030 probably in line with all of the developed world electric vehicles will become de rigeur as will renewable energy to curb bad air ground and water pollution rural industrialisation is an inevitable priority as more and more people migrate to the cities as a corollary to development seen all over the world so there will be mechanisation productivity enhancement village industry and so on to transform the countryside clean rivers are starting to become a reality for the first time with sewage and chemicals being processed instead of being allowed to pollute the rivers this trend will be strengthened going forward even as ganga water has shown improvement for the very first time let us remember that there were no fish in the thames because it was so polluted before conservation measures were put in place there will be a scaling up of the blue water economy using the flagship sagarmala and other projects the space programme will send an indian to space by 2022 and india will become the world s go to place for the launch of satellites food self sufficiency already a thing achieved must be maintained using sustainable farming practices comprehensive education and healthcare for all is on its way to becoming a reality but is also a basic requirement for a developed economy improved government efficiency as a goal is probably the hardest to achieve but can come about if permanent tenure is removed the biggest defence budget ever at rs 3 lakh plus crore however is grossly inadequate considering the backlog of work towards modernisation of the equipment for the armed forces this will have to be reinforced liberally off budget the budget for the indian railways towards modernisation greater connectivity and growth has been enhanced as it is on its way to revival and profitability once again it is indeed a proud achievement that all unmanned level crossings on the broad gauge network have now been eliminated people need not die at them anymore civil aviation is growing by leaps and bounds as over a million people use it daily to travel to and from 100 airports domestically there are many other aspects of this budget both in the headlines and the fine print but suffice is to say that it plans to increase expenditure significantly without wrecking the fiscal deficit let us hope the government s substantial divestment psu programme which has not gone particularly well does not queer the pitch the lending and rating agencies will be watching for fiscal slippage is this budget responsive as it is too little too late in the day to seriously influence the coming elections this depends on what one thinks of both public memory and attention span modi clearly thinks that it is best to do welcome things as close to the general elections as possible the coherence and signature represented by the six modi budgets is in the emphasis given to long term nation building and modernisation over populist sops it is this that has given us the good macroeconomic profile and the international recognition of an economy on the move of course at the grassroots level this budget acknowledges that there is much that remains to be done but the opposition seems to be considerably behind the curve on this because it relies heavily as always on the gullibility of the voter and its response to the promise of immediate benefit however fraudulent it has even worked for them to an extent electorally very recently will it do the trick in a couple of months my guess is that it is advantage narendra modi all the way
it s a common mistake of both left and right to talk about capitalism and socialism as if there were only two choices by dr steve hochstadt emeritus professor of history illinois college capitalism based on the profit motive and private ownership is supposed to provide the best economic outcomes for everybody as the owners of industry and commerce enrich themselves they provide employment for the rest of the population everyone shares in economic growth even if owners reap a greater share the metaphor a rising tide lifts all boats describes this explanation of how capitalism should work proponents of socialism argue that only the owners of capital profit from such a system the great majority of people labor for the profit of a few they propose an economic system based on social ownership and more equal distribution of profits these competing theories tend to leave out the role of government in shaping an economy and influencing the distribution of wealth in every economic system the state encourages and restricts economic activity and funnels economic advantages to selected population groups in all of the real existing systems that have called themselves socialist social ownership has meant in practice government ownership in every case since the creation of the soviet union socialist governments have been dominated by a single political party which have not allowed any challenges to their power inevitably this has led to the corruption of the ideal of popular ownership of the economy those in charge of socialist governments have given themselves and their close supporters economic privileges denied to the wider population from the special access to goods and services enjoyed by members of the communist party in the soviet union and its eastern european satellites to the accumulation of wealth by the leading families of communist china the absence of democracy the brutal repression of critical ideas and the continuing economic weaknesses of the soviet systems led to their collapse in 1989 but not all socialist states were so unsuccessful china which had one of the world s poorest populations through the first half of the 20thcentury has nearly eradicated extreme poverty according to the world bank although the cuban economy is one of the most government controlled in the world the poverty level is very low and education and health care rank high in the us capitalism has sometimes worked to make all boats rise a remarkable studylast year of the history of national income written by the foremost french researchers about income inequality thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman shows that from 1946 to 1980 real income doubled across the economic spectrum that was also a period of extraordinary economic growth gains of over 5 in gross domestic product for most years and occasionally more than 10 the top income tax rate for the richest americans was higher than 85 until 1964 and then 70 until 1980 nevertheless the top 0 01 tripled their income after taxes in this period but since 1980 the story has been very different the income of the poorer half of americans has remained completely stagnant the upper half has seen its income grow but most of that growth has been at the very top incomes of the top 1 have tripled and that tiny rich slice earns almost twice as much before taxes as the whole bottom half the few thousand families in the top 001 have multiplied their income 7 times our graduated income tax along with other income based payments like medicaid does redistribute money toward the bottom but that hardly dents the huge inequality that s due to political choices the top tax rate has fallen steadily to 50 in 1982 to 40 in 1993 to 35 in 2003 the tax rate on capital gains from stocks which nearly all go to the wealthiest americans has also fallen from 40 to 20 after nearly tripling from 1940 to 1970 the real value of the minimum wage has fallen since then one of the least discussed but most important political policies that contributes to growing inequality is the ability of the very rich to hide their income in international tax shelters the leak of the so called panama papers brought the illegal use of tax havens into the international spotlight the anonymous leaker said he was motivated by income inequality it is estimated than 10 of the world s gdp is held in offshore banks including about 8 of american gdp corporations have contributed to rising inequality by boosting the incomes of top management ceo s earned about 30 times the income of a typical worker in 1980 that ratio has skyrocketed to 300 times average wages political choices continue to widen the economic gulf between the few and the many the republican tax reform of 2017 mainly benefitted the rich notably by doubling the amount of money that can be left in an estate without being taxed helping only a few thousand families growing inequality is not only an american problem but a global problem that keeps getting worse between 2010 and 2016 the total wealth owned by the poorest half of the world s population fell by over one third at this moment the world s top 1 owns more than all the rest of us the world s economy keeps growing but the yachts of the wealthiest are disappearing from view since 2000 the bottom half of the world s population has gotten about 1 of the increase in global wealth the top 1 took in half of that growth the 8 richest men in the world now own as much as the poorer half of the global population 3 6 billion people rising inequality in the us has provoked louder discussion conservatives try to derail political discussions about economic inequality by talking about the politics of envy mitt romney as presidential candidate in 2012 criticized president obama s concern for the poor i think it s about envy i think it s about class warfare when you have a president encouraging the idea of dividing america based on the 99 percent versus 1 percent and those people who have been most successful will be in the 1 percent you have opened up a whole new wave of approach in this country which is entirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under god scary diatribes about the failures of socialism are designed to support the status quo it s a common mistake of both left and right to talk about capitalism and socialism as if there were only two choices one party socialist systems in less developed countries have not worked well over the past century capitalism as practiced in the united states and many other nations has mainly benefitted those who already are wealthy the nations in which all citizens gain from economic growth have combined elements of market economies private ownership and political policies that mitigate inequality in western europe public health care nearly free university education stronger progressive taxation higher minimum wages and inclusion of trade unions in corporate decision making result in much lower inequality and much happier populations no american politician argues for replacing capitalism the political choices of the past 40 years have weakened our national economy and our political unity by favoring the wealthy the rising tide is swamping too many american boats it s time for a different politics originally published by history news network 01 30 2019 reprinted with permission for

sri lankan president maithripala sirisena delivered a speech to mark the country s national independence day which summed up the hypocrisy political decay and deep crisis of capitalist rule in the country the independence ceremony was held at galle face green in central colombo on february 4 the celebration was dominated by military parades military officers provided commentary boasting of the role that each regiment played during the bloody 30 year communal war by successive sri lankan governments to suppress the tamil minority and divide the working class along ethnic lines invitees to the ceremony included political leaders the military top brass colombo diplomats and religious leaders including buddhist prelates their presence alone graphically demonstrated that the event had nothing to do with working people and the poor significantly the guest of honour was the newly elected maldivian president ibrahim mohamed solih who was installed in a regime change operation by the us and india to scuttle china s strategic influence in that country the maldivian opposition which rallied behind solih operated mostly from sri lanka by honouring him every faction of the sri lankan ruling elite is seeking the blessing of the us imperialism sirisena began his speech by lamenting it is sad to note that the leaders of our history including us are responsible for the inability to find a clear political solution that all can agree on although a decade has passed after the end of the 30 year war the war ended with the military defeat of the separatist liberation tigers of tamil eelam in may 2009 during the final offensives tens of thousands tamil civilians were killed nearly 300 000 were detained and more than 10 000 abducted sirisena came to power in 2015 together with prime minister ranil wickremesinghe promising to change the constitution to enable a political reconciliation thereby securing the backing of the tamil national alliance this would have involved a limited devolution of powers to the tamil bourgeoisie in the north and east of the island neither sirisena nor wickremesinghe had an iota of concern for the democratic rights of tamils who have been repressed by successive colombo governments in his speech sirisena repeatedly praised the war heroes that is those responsible for war crimes for liberating the country and promised them greater benefits the north and east are still under oppressive military occupation sirisena s reference to the lack of a political solution reflects the fear in ruling circles that unrest in the north and east is taking place amid growing struggles by workers throughout the island he also referred to the basis for this broader social turbulence bewailing the failure of political leaders to bring about the economic development our country and the people have expected for decades the president pointed to the official poverty rate of 6 7 percent and added that more than 50 percent of the population is suffering from relative poverty they have a daily wage of less than 1000 rupees us5 60 unemployment and debt problem is rampant one child out of four is suffering from malnutrition he said these figures are an indictment of the failure of successive governments to meet the pressing social needs of the masses in 71 years since formal independence from british colonial rule hinting at the social consequences sirisena said the people of the country are no longer ready to continue in an economic recession the political leaders who lead the country should be aware of this the sri lankan ruling class is nervous about the resurgence of the international working class as the class struggles were developing in the us and europe hundreds of thousands of plantation workers in sri lanka were engaged in a wage struggle for the past four months along with protests by other private and public sector workers sirisena who was a senior minister for decades and a leader of sri lanka freedom party slfp falsely claimed that as president he sought to address the social crisis i attempted to enter into a new political journey with novel development experiences he said in reality sirisena came to power in the 2015 presidential election by exploiting the opposition to the government of president mahinda rajapakse over its war atrocities and attacks on social and democratic rights despite sirisena being one of rajapakse s ministers and close allies the pseudo left organisations and so called civil society groups falsely promoted him as the democratic alternative it was through this right wing movement that washington orchestrated a regime change operation to oust rajapakse and install sirisena the us was hostile to rajapakse not because of his anti democratic rule but because his relations with china cut across washington s aggressive confrontation with beijing after four years the sirisena wickremesinghe government has been thoroughly discredited because of its attacks on living conditions and democratic rights poverty has worsened as a result of its implementation of international monetary fund dictated austerity measures amid rising popular discontent the parties of both sirisena and wickremesinghe faced heavy losses in local government elections last february sirisena quickly distanced himself from the government and lined up with his arch rival rajapakse in a bid to bring in a strong government to suppress the mounting opposition sirisena sacked wickremesinghe in late october as prime minister and replaced him with rajapakse however this attempted political coup failed hostile to the return of rajapakse the us mounted intense pressure to reinstate wickremesinghe when rajapakse was unable to muster a parliamentary majority sirisena dissolved parliament only to be overruled by the supreme court which compelled him to reappoint wickremesinghe the political infighting is continuing however without a clear parliamentary majority wickremesinghe is now seeking to form a national government by politically bribing mps from other parties with minister posts in his speech sirisena publicly criticised the prime minister s moves to form a national government despite criticising the failures of past governments the president could not say a word about how he could solve the pressing economic and social problems facing the country sirisena s open flouting of the constitution was another sharp warning that the ruling class will resort to police state measures to suppress the growing movement of the working class the decay of capitalist rule in sri lanka since formal independence in 1948 poses crucial political tasks for workers and youth the only way to achieve essential democratic and social rights is on the basis of the fight for socialist internationalism and the struggle to establish a socialist republic of sri lanka and eelam as a part of a union of socialist republics of south asia the socialist equality party fights for this perspective

bangladesh is not some scandinavian heaven it is poor and overpopulated undereducated and corrupt frequented by natural catastrophes experiences occasional terrorism and the farcical nature of its democracy was exposed in the december 2018 elections but the earlier caricature of a country on life support disappeared years ago today some economists say it shall be the next asian tiger its growth rate last year 7 8 per cent put it at par with india 8 0pc and well above pakistan 5 8pc the debt per capita for bangladesh 434 is less than half that for pakistan 974 and its foreign exchange reserves 32 billion are four times pakistan s 8bn take a look why we lag behind much of this growth owes to exports which zoomed from zero in 1971 to 35 8bn in 2018 pakistan s is 24 8bn bangladesh produces no cotton but to the chagrin of pakistan s pampered textile industry it has eaten savagely into its market share the imf calculates bangladesh s economy growing from 180bn presently to 322bn by 2021 this means that the average bangladeshi today is almost as wealthy as the average pakistani and if the rupee depreciates further will be technically wealthier by 2020 other indicators are equally stunning east pakistan s population in the 1951 census was 42 million while west pakistan s was 33 7m but today bangladesh has far fewer people than pakistan 165m versus 200m a sustained population planning campaign helped reduce fertility in bangladesh no such campaign or even its beginnings is visible today in pakistan eschewing militarism in favour of human development bangladesh set its initial priorities correctly the health sector is no less impressive far fewer babies die at birth in bangladesh than in pakistan immunisation is common and no one gets shot dead for administering polio drops life expectancy 72 5 years is higher than pakistan s 66 5 years according to the ilo females are well ahead in employment 33 2pc as compared to pakistan 25 1pc how did west pakistan s poor cousin manage to upstage its richer relative by so much so fast it s all the more puzzling because bangladesh has no geostrategic assets saleable to america china or saudi arabia it also has no nuclear weapons no army of significance no wise men in uniform running the country from the shadows and no large pool of competent professionals at birth east pakistan had in fact no trained bureaucracy it received just one member of the former indian civil service special report the breakup of pakistan 1969 1971 none should be more surprised at these new developments than those west pakistanis like me who went to school during the 1950s and 1960s and grew up surrounded by unconcealed racism short and dark bengalis were reputedly good only for growing jute and rice and catching fish they were muslims and pakistanis of course but as children we were made to imagine that all good muslims and real pakistanis are tall fair and speak chaste urdu we d laugh madly at the strange sounding bengali news broadcasts from radio pakistan in our foolish macho world they sounded terribly feminine the mega surrender of 1971 made west pakistanis eat humble pie but even as the two nation theory went out of the window the overwhelming majority was loath to change its thinking the west wing renamed itself pakistan many assuming this was temporary they said bangladesh could never survive economically and would humbly ask to be taken back others optimistically imagined that the disaster had taught pakistan a profound lesson making change inevitable responding enthusiastically to the popular roti kapra makaan slogan they believed pakistan would shift from pampering its hyper privileged ones towards providing welfare for all equally it was hoped that the rights of pakistan s culturally diverse regions would be respected none of this happened instead we simply got more of what had been earlier thirsting for vengeance pakistan s establishment could think of nothing beyond wounded honour and ways to settle scores with india zulfikar ali bhutto s secret call for the nuclear bomb led to the famed multan meeting just six weeks after the surrender that centralisation of authority breeds local resentment remained an unlearned lesson in 1973 bhutto dismissed the nap government in balochistan and ordered military action starting a series of local rebellions that has never gone away in doing so he re empowered those who ultimately hanged him in a nutshell bangladesh and pakistan are different countries today because they perceive their national interest very differently bangladesh sees its future in human development and economic growth goal posts are set at increasing exports reducing unemployment improving health reducing dependence upon loans and aid and further extending micro credit water and boundary disputes with india are serious and bangladesh suffers bullying by its bigger neighbour on matters of illegal immigration drugs etc but its basic priorities have not wavered for pakistan human development comes a distant second the bulk of national energies remain focused upon check mating india relations with afghanistan and iran are therefore troubled pakistan accuses both of being excessively close to india but the most expensive consequence of the security state mindset was the nurturing of extra state actors in the 1990s ultimately they had to be crushed after the aps massacre of dec 16 2014 this coincidentally was the day dhaka had fallen 43 years earlier bangladesh is conflicted by internal rifts still being more multicultural and liberal its civil society and activist intelligentsia have stopped armed groups from grabbing the reins of power although elected or quasi elected bangladeshi leaders are often horribly corrupt and incompetent they don t simply endorse decisions they actually make them ultimately responsible to their electorate they are forced to invest in people instead of weapons or a massive military establishment for pakistan these are lessons to be pondered over cpec or no cpec it s impossible to match india tank for tank or missile by missile surely it is time to get realistic shouting pakistan zindabad from the rooftops while obsequiously taking dictation from the americans chinese and saudis has taken us nowhere announcing that we have become targets of a fifth generation hi tech secret subversion inflames national paranoia but is otherwise pointless instead to move forward pakistan must transform its war economy into ultimately becoming a peace economy the writer

sen bernie sanders i vt stewed for a few hours over president donald trump s critique of socialism in tuesday s state of the union address then lashed back on twitter with this defense of his cherished ideology people are not truly free when they can t afford health care prescription drugs or a place to live people are not free when they cannot retire with dignity or feed their families this should resolve any lingering doubts about socialism s death grip on the democrat party because bernie sanders eruption is a core tenet of the party he allies with democrats are constantly parroting the line that people cannot be truly free unless their government provides the necessities of life which they pretend will become free in the materialist sense because the government is giving them away this equation of material goods with freedom is nothing new it is an increasingly popular element of democrat rhetoric for example then house minority leader nancy pelosi explained in 2012 that obamacare meant liberation for americans because it would allow them to quit their jobs and become writers musicians or artists to put this in orwellian terms sanders and the democrats are saying slavery is freedom you cannot be free unless other people are enslaved by the state and compelled to provide essential goods it is a materialistic view of freedom with deep roots in marxist ideology which holds that people cannot be authentic and emotionally honest when they are forced to work for their sustenance and bow before the wealthy jackasses who sign their paychecks the astute observer of current events will have noticed that free is the last word any rational person would employ to describe socialist systems in the real world socialism tends toward authoritarian control and the violent suppression of dissent especially once socialist theory destroys the economy essential goods become scarce and inflation makes the national currency worth less than the toilet paper nobody can find in stores socialists sputter defensively that this string of left wing authoritarian nightmares occurred only because the wrong people run the decrepit systems in places like venezuela and true socialism has never been tried this is arrant and dangerous nonsense when slavery is freedom when you can only be free because the state forces other people to satisfy your needs tyranny and violence are not bizarre aberrations they are features of the system not bugs socialists must fiercely punish any sheep who refuses to be fleeced so that another can have the blanket she deserves the core problem is that people should be free but no material resource is ever really free state power cannot truly make anything cheaper either which is the slightly softer version of slavery freedom peddled by western socialists the value of goods and services does not change to match political demands socialism simply changes the way these goods are paid for transitioning from relatively simple and open capitalism to a baroque and opaque centrally planned system that lies constantly to everyone involved in it lies become the currency of a socialist system the elite maintains power by convincing people of absurdities such as the notion that politicians can fine tune the price of goods and labor by waving magic wands the truth is that an hour of labor worth 6 to employers does not suddenly become worth 15 just because bernie sanders says so nor does 1 000 of medicine suddenly cost 10 the only thing socialists can do is employ coercive force to change who pays for it the new payment arrangements are invariably more opaque and confusing than free market capitalism the apparent beneficiaries might be initially thrilled by their sudden access to free or artificially cheap goods but soon they discover they do pay for it through everything from higher taxes to lost jobs a degraded standard of living and in the case of rationed socialized medicine untimely death the working man simply is not present to see the final step in a very long series of secretive socialist transactions in which his confiscated dollar bounces around sinkholes of corruption and inefficiency eventually arriving as a handful of pennies in the hands of the provider he might have freely hired at far lower cost if allowed to there are many ways to enslave people the old fashioned method of forcing them to work for nothing except relief from the lash is crude and requires enormous levels of physical force to impose the sophisticated modern approach is to enslave people with lies if citizens do not know how much anything really costs or who pays for it they cannot make informed free choices either at the cash register or ballot box a few days after sanders erupted in fury over trump s insult to socialism the radicals of the democrat party unveiled their green new deal a very pure expression of the sanders idea that freedom can only be achieved when the state controls everything it is a towering edifice of compulsion that constitutes the most open declaration of war against the american middle class we have ever seen the left loathes the middle class because it is prosperous enough to care about economic freedom and numerous enough to protect it with votes the middle class already has everything democrats claim the government must provide in order to make them free because they worked saved and invested to purchase those things for themselves subjugating the middle class is the core objective of leftist politics and the green new deal would accomplish it with a single stroke effectively destroying everything that defines middle class life in america right down to the private ownership of motor vehicles when churlish critics with the sorcerous ability to perform basic math pointed out the cost of the green new deal would be utterly beyond reason true believers shot back that the government can simply print as many dollars as it would take to pay for trashing the entire power grid and rebuilding every structure in the country that kind of currency devaluation is another freedom is slavery trick turning the dollar into confetti would be a very effective way of subduing and controlling the middle class dollars are votes cast far more frequently and with greater potency than any election ballot devaluing the dollar would make the population more obedient more dependent upon government and less capable of pursuing any strategy except those cooked up by the political elite the green new deal would make americans the one thing they have never been obedient that is the final logical extension of sanders idea that people can only be free if the state cares for their material needs by removing the burden of working hard and spending wisely obedience is the fossil fuel that keeps the badly tuned engine of socialism running disobedience is an impurity that must be removed the journey leftward always begins with activists who claim work is slavery and ends with rulers who regard free choice as treason

by steve hochstadt capitalism based on the profit motive and private ownership is supposed to provide the best economic outcomes for everybody as the owners of industry and commerce enrich themselves they provide employment for the rest of the population everyone shares in economic growth even if owners reap a greater share the metaphor a rising tide lifts all boats describes this explanation of how capitalism should work proponents of socialism argue that only the owners of capital profit from such a system the great majority of people labor for the profit of a few they propose an economic system based on social ownership and more equal distribution of profits these competing theories tend to leave out the role of government in shaping an economy and influencing the distribution of wealth in every economic system the state encourages and restricts economic activity and funnels economic advantages to selected population groups in all of the real existing systems that have called themselves socialist social ownership has meant in practice government ownership in every case since the creation of the soviet union socialist governments have been dominated by a single political party which have not allowed any challenges to their power inevitably this has led to the corruption of the ideal of popular ownership of the economy those in charge of socialist governments have given themselves and their close supporters economic privileges denied to the wider population from the special access to goods and services enjoyed by members of the communist party in the soviet union and its eastern european satellites to the accumulation of wealth by the leading families of communist china the absence of democracy the brutal repression of critical ideas and the continuing economic weaknesses of the soviet systems led to their collapse in 1989 but not all socialist states were so unsuccessful china which had one of the world s poorest populations through the first half of the 20thcentury has nearly eradicated extreme poverty according to the world bank although the cuban economy is one of the most government controlled in the world the poverty level is very low and education and health care rank high in the us capitalism has sometimes worked to make all boats rise a remarkable studylast year of the history of national income written by the foremost french researchers about income inequality thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman shows that from 1946 to 1980 real income doubled across the economic spectrum that was also a period of extraordinary economic growth gains of over 5 in gross domestic product for most years and occasionally more than 10 the top income tax rate for the richest americans was higher than 85 until 1964 and then 70 until 1980 nevertheless the top 0 01 tripled their income after taxes in this period but since 1980 the story has been very different the income of the poorer half of americans has remained completely stagnant the upper half has seen its income grow but most of that growth has been at the very top incomes of the top 1 have tripled and that tiny rich slice earns almost twice as much before taxes as the whole bottom half the few thousand families in the top 001 have multiplied their income 7 times our graduated income tax along with other income based payments like medicaid does redistribute money toward the bottom but that hardly dents the huge inequality that s due to political choices the top tax rate has fallen steadily to 50 in 1982 to 40 in 1993 to 35 in 2003 the tax rate on capital gains from stocks which nearly all go to the wealthiest americans has also fallen from 40 to 20 after nearly tripling from 1940 to 1970 the real value of the minimum wage has fallen since then one of the least discussed but most important political policies that contributes to growing inequality is the ability of the very rich to hide their income in international tax shelters the leak of the so called panama papers brought the illegal use of tax havens into the international spotlight the anonymous leaker said he was motivated by income inequality it is estimated than 10 of the world s gdp is held in offshore banks including about 8 of american gdp corporations have contributed to rising inequality by boosting the incomes of top management ceo s earned about 30 times the income of a typical worker in 1980 that ratio has skyrocketed to 300 times average wages political choices continue to widen the economic gulf between the few and the many the republican tax reform of 2017 mainly benefitted the rich notably by doubling the amount of money that can be left in an estate without being taxed helping only a few thousand families growing inequality is not only an american problem but a global problem that keeps getting worse between 2010 and 2016 the total wealth owned by the poorest half of the world s population fell by over one third at this moment the world s top 1 owns more than all the rest of us the world s economy keeps growing but the yachts of the wealthiest are disappearing from view since 2000 the bottom half of the world s population has gotten about 1 of the increase in global wealth the top 1 took in half of that growth the 8 richest men in the world now own as much as the poorer half of the global population 3 6 billion people rising inequality in the us has provoked louder discussion conservatives try to derail political discussions about economic inequality by talking about the politics of envy mitt romney as presidential candidate in 2012 criticized president obama s concern for the poor i think it s about envy i think it s about class warfare when you have a president encouraging the idea of dividing america based on the 99 percent versus 1 percent and those people who have been most successful will be in the 1 percent you have opened up a whole new wave of approach in this country which is entirely inconsistent with the concept of one nation under god scary diatribes about the failures of socialism are designed to support the status quo it s a common mistake of both left and right to talk about capitalism and socialism as if there were only two choices one party socialist systems in less developed countries have not worked well over the past century capitalism as practiced in the united states and many other nations has mainly benefitted those who already are wealthy the nations in which all citizens gain from economic growth have combined elements of market economies private ownership and political policies that mitigate inequality in western europe public health care nearly free university education stronger progressive taxation higher minimum wages and inclusion of trade unions in corporate decision making result in much lower inequality and much happier populations no american politician argues for replacing capitalism the political choices of the past 40 years have weakened our national economy and our political unity by favoring the wealthy the rising tide is swamping too many american boats it s time for a different politics
washington let s coin a new law of politics call it neuman s law after alfred e neuman of mad magazine fame whose philosophy is what me worry neuman s law postulates that there is never a good time to raise taxes or cut federal spending this explains why since 1961 the annual federal budget has been in deficit 52 times and in surplus only five times 1969 and 1998 2001 unsurprisingly all the surpluses occurred at the end of economic booms that automatically raised tax revenues and curtailed spending the latest champions of neuman s law are lawrence summers treasury secretary under president clinton and director of the national economic council under president obama and jason furman the last chairman of the white house council of economic advisers under obama both are economists both teach at harvard writing in foreign affairs published by the council on foreign relations summers and furman discuss the budget outlook in great detail throwing hordes of facts and figures at readers but their conclusion corroborates neuman s law deficits should not cause policymakers much concern at least for now they write it s time for washington to put away its debt obsession they conclude obsession they must be kidding this inverts the truth if washington feared debt congress would long ago have tamed budget deficits deficits are the annual gap between federal revenues and spending debt is the accumulation of all past deficits what both democrats and republicans actually fear are the highly unpopular steps spending cuts or tax increases they might have to take to reduce or eliminate the deficits which are huge the congressional budget office s latest baseline estimate for 2019 is nearly 900 billion this equals 4 2 percent of the economy gross domestic product and 20 percent of federal spending advertisement so why bother ask furman and summers deficits aren t now doing the economy much harm interest rates are low and may well stay that way if deficits are cut too abruptly the present economic expansion could falter these are possibilities but doing nothing also poses dangers as even summers and furman concede higher debt levels could make it hard for future governments to stimulate the economy in a downturn they say if escalating debt raises interest rates it could crowd out private investment undermining the economy s long term growth potential or some sort of financial crisis might occur if investors become sated with u s treasury bonds curiously furman and summers say that we can t simply borrow indefinitely as much as we d like the debt cannot be allowed to grow forever they write the government cannot set budget policy without any limiting principles or guides as to what is and what is not possible or desirable they say at one point at another they warn sooner or later government spending has to be paid for but what are the limiting principles and when and how might government spending be paid for they don t say their promises are vague rhetorical throwaway lines that in isolation have no credibility to be fair there is brief mention of a proposal to accept the existing increases in government debt but insist that any new spending or tax cuts not raise the debt further details are few and this provides little restraint in 2018 the federal debt held by the public was 78 percent of gdp more than double the 35 percent in 2007 the cbo projects that under present policies it will be 93 percent of gdp in 2029 and rising no one really knows the long term effects of these continuously large deficits but there is a crude analogy in the recent past that provides a warning double digit inflation consumer prices went from about 1 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 1980 many economists argued then that a little more inflation wouldn t harm the economy but a little more soon became a lot more and only the harsh 1980 82 downturn peak unemployment 10 8 percent brought it under control advertisement it s doubtful that summers and furman will be much impressed by neuman s law but they are living proof of its power the message that a reasonable person would take from their essay is that the government can borrow unlimited amounts for the foreseeable future this also seems to be the position of the trump administration the essay s true purpose seems to be to provide intellectual support for what self interested politicians would do in any case enjoy present pleasures and postpone any future unpleasantness let someone else worry about the future that s neuman s law and it s mad robert samuelson is a columnist with the washington post robert samuelson send questions comments to the editors filed under

08 02 2019 next on trump s list events in venezuela amount to an imperialist coup attempt but the left still draws no lessons from the failures of the bolivarian revolution paul demarty investigates the political situation in venezuela seems for now to have reached a rather tense stalemate the media in america and europe has had to retreat from taking seriously juan guaidó s claim to actually rule as interim president but they and their respective governments have played their hand in supporting him nicolás maduro refuses to budge bristling intransigently at the endless demands for fresh elections and mass rightwing protests yet he seems quite as incapable of restoring what passed for order before this latest phase of venezuela s descent into chaos the situation has gotten quite so dangerous due to the swaggering machismo of the president the president of the united states that is who refuses to rule out a military intervention in this particular corner of uncle sam s backyard yet the deadlock cannot but remind us of an earlier moment in recent venezuelan history when a cia backed coup against maduro s illustrious predecessor hugo chávez failed ignominiously back in 2002 astroturfed protests led a businessman backed by reactionary army officers to declare himself interim president and suspend the constitution but chávez was swept back into power within days it was the decisive moment that propelled him into left superstardom the world over and fired the starting gun on the wave of similar left bonapartist regimes that called itself the bolivarian revolution the differences with today are all too obvious maduro is not about to defeat his enemies decisively at any rate and there is a real danger that the coup makers will succeed however the current situation plays out it looks like the end of the bolivarian revolution as we know it at its core chávez s project was quite straightforward venezuela is extraordinarily oil rich chávez proceeded to expand the holdings of the state oil company pdvsa at the expense of international capital this provided a substantial revenue base for redistribution to his core electoral supporters among the urban and rural poor social programmes were stepped up doctors were brought in from cuba in a highly symbolic deal between the older and newer generations of latin american leftism chávez was very good at telling people what they wanted to hear and giving them enough of what they wanted that they continued to support him as it went for the venezuelan popular classes so for an army of international admirers the bandwagon jumpers and spear carriers of the global left the remnants of the anti globalisation movement stalinists mandelites and so forth were utterly bewitched and chávez knew the buttons to press he was going to found a fifth international he quoted trotsky to trotskyists and castro to castroites he talked big about 21st century socialism we would say that it was quite remarkable how easily people were taken in when upon the most cursory examination 21st century socialism turned out to be 20th century left nationalism propped up by pdvsa s petro dollars but then it isn t remarkable at all but merely typical of leftwing credulousness not even chávez s most obsequious admirers can have expected him to live forever and after a long struggle with cancer he passed away in 2013 there were already signs that the regime was out of ideas long standing problems like a soaring crime rate that left caracas one of the most violent cities in the region seemed intractable and while many had been lifted out of poverty there had been little improvement in the quality of housing and basic infrastructure it is all too convenient to blame maduro for the crisis that followed but somewhat unfair chávez s successor had the misfortune of occupying the top job when the music stopped price in 2014 the global price of oil collapsed a slowdown in industrial output led to demand shrinkage starting the slide but the oil price is extremely easily manipulable and it is clear that the us state department leaned on oil producing allies especially saudi arabia to keep production levels up so as to punish its enemies foremost among them at the time was putin s russia whose intervention in the ukrainian colour revolution and defensive annexation of crimea led to a diplomatic crisis venezuela was highly vulnerable too however and a deep economic and political crisis followed which continues today matters were made worse by us sanctions that forbid export of oil extraction equipment to venezuela since the recent escalation in hostilities the sanctions have been ratcheted up further with us companies banned from doing business with pdvsa any monies paid will go into an escrow account to be handed over to wannabe president guaidó as and when he succeeds in setting himself up as trump s viceroy in caracas this is no small matter venezuela is extremely reliant on oil exports to the us they generate revenue as opposed to exports to china and russia which principally service debts there are ominous signs that things may not stop there trump refuses to rule out military action his secretary of state is apparently considering deploying troops to neighbouring colombia whose government is fanatically rightwing and historically connected to counterrevolutionary death squads during that country s long civil war and will thus be quite happy to abet an american invasion trump himself is increasingly hemmed in at home but the american constitution as it operates in practice anyway offers broad discretion to the commander in chief in matters of war and peace a spectacular crusade for freedom the far side of the caribbean would be just the sort of stunt he needs to set up a hottentot election next year though the bolivarian armed forces are not likely to put up much resistance to the conventional army of the united states there remains of course the question of winning the peace and another protracted and bloody conflict after the fashion of colombia or other places in the usa s backyard in the post war era cannot be ruled out if the yankees are too obviously to blame there remains the question of whether the army will even try to fight back in such a case and maduro s prima facie bizarre failure to arrest his usurper combined with frequent frantic visits to military units suggests a level of worry about their loyalty that bodes ill for the regime s supporters in that light the future is perhaps not a return to the bloodbaths of colombia and el salvador but the present state of brazil guaidó is currently basked in the light of international adulation but he has been chumming up with jair bolsonaro ever since the latter s election add a fanatical middle class revolt against a left regime to a foreign backed coup and the result is just such a regime of foul reaction socialism but back to maduro s supporters what of international chávez fandom on one level these events are easily digested by chávistas their character as an imperialist corrupt police action in the us s near abroad are so transparent that even the alliance for workers liberty has had to denounce it 1 too easily digested by half really as will become clear from a look at a piece from the international marxist tendency the splinter of militant that hitched its wagon to the venezuelan revolution early on and remains its most vociferous trotskyist publicist 2 this article by imt international secretariat member jorge martin is not at all without interest the comrade goes into some detail on the specifics of sanctions and provocations against the regime and we will not recapitulate these points here except to say that there are far worse introductions to the topic what however are comrade martin s political conclusions the only way to effectively fight off this imperialist coup is by taking revolutionary measures and leaning on the revolutionary masses the us has seized venezuelan property and imposed sanctions the proportionate response would have been to seize all property of us multinationals in venezuela the bank of england has stolen 14 tons of gold from venezuela venezuela would be justified in seizing assets for the same amount from uk companies in venezuela from there we build up to the empyrean ecstasies of social revolution in order to mobilise the revolutionary energy of workers and peasants a policy is needed that puts their needs first repudiate the foreign debt expropriate the food distribution chain give the land to the peasants and arm them to defend it and plan the economy democratically under workers and peasants control to fulfil the needs of the people this is the line that the comrades of the are agitating for in venezuela there are many remarkable features of this prescription the first is the enormous overestimation of the popular support for revolutionary socialism in the venezuelan population in many respects the demands raised here are salutary but their being raised as a way out of the current crisis for the venezuelan left is almost comical arm the people yes not a moment too soon alas decades too late in order for any of this to have had any traction it would be necessary to have undermined trust in military bonapartist socialism from the get go to have bravely pointed out its limits to the masses so far as was possible when the going was good as tory idiots like to say when justifying austerity policies you need to mend the roof while the sun is shining the imt did no such thing instead setting itself up as an obsequious camp follower for the photogenic colonels today comrade we are where we are and the peasants and workers are not armed or even conscious of the need for arms but who would trust the army to arm the masses now not comrade martin who correctly reminds us that pinochet was appointed by president allende as the head of the armed forces after the failed tanquetazo coup of june 1973 as a constitutionalist officer yet this is not the most serious problem which is truly staring comrade martin in the face given his punishingly detailed analysis of us and european sanctions one thing is abundantly clear venezuela is in no position to face down the power of international capital doing so would mean for a start giving up its oil industry entirely since it cannot operate without foreign investment foreign industrial products and access to the most diplomatically sensitive of global commodities markets martin would almost have us believe that maduro is merely being timid perhaps we might suggest that he knows something martin is apparently incapable of learning nobody can eat revolutionary energy or drink defiance the surprise is not that bolivarian socialism is in a state of collapse but that it held on for so long an international movement might reverse the fortunes of the coup makers and offer a way out of chávismo that does not lead the western hemisphere further into trumpian and bolsonarian barbarism but such a solution looks desperately unlikely at present paul demarty weeklyworker co uk notes 1 they do so only

officer good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review skechers fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results with me on the call is john vandemore skechers chief financial officer who will discuss our financial results in detail we achieved a new fourth quarter sales record of 1 08 billion an 11 4 increase over last year this was the result of our international business increasing 17 9 and our domestic business increasing 4 1 on a constant currency basis our sales growth for the quarter was 13 7 our record fourth quarter follows three prior quarters of record sale which resulted in a new annual sales record of 4 64 billion the growth came from a 19 2 increase in our international business and a 3 5 increase in our domestic business in addition to the record sales fourth quarter highlights include earnings from operations of 83 7 million a 50 increase diluted earnings per share of 0 31 a 4 8 sales increase in our domestic wholesale business a 7 5 sales increase in our company owned retail stores and 18 4 sales increase in our international wholesale business the result of double digit increases in our international distributor subsidiary and joint venture businesses expanding our skechers retail network to 2 998 stores worldwide including the opening of 11 new company owned stores and 195 third party stores breaking ground on our new distribution and logistics center in china and repurchasing 1 7 million shares of class a common stock highlights for the full year include record sales of 4 64 billion diluted earnings per share of 1 92 gross margins of 47 9 international representing 54 2 of our sales record shipments from our distribution centers in north and south america europe and japan maintaining our position in the united states as the no 1 walking work casual lifestyle and casual dress brand and repurchasing 3 7 million shares of class a common stock we believe four quarters of record sales and record annual earnings of 1 92 per diluted share are a significant achievement the key to our success was our diverse product offering which allowed us to expand our reach into more fashion accounts in 2018 and our diverse distribution which offered numerous new growth opportunities these opportunities included the launch of e commerce sites in india and by our distributor in russia as well as improving the infrastructure of our digital e commerce capabilities in the united states we are still a relatively young brand in developing markets with great opportunities in regions like latin america and eastern europe as well as in high growth international countries including china india and mexico in 2019 our focus will be on continuing to drive sales with new product offerings and building our brands in international markets now turning to our business channels in detail our domestic wholesale business increased 4 8 for the fourth quarter and 0 8 for the full year domestic wholesale gross margins increased 140 basis points for the quarter and were flat for the full year for the year we maintained our position in the united states as the no 1 walking work casual lifestyle and casual dress brand and moved up to one position to be the third largest footwear brand in the united states according to sportsonesource we saw our strength across several categories such as men s usa and women s performance bobs and work and in numerous styles such as skechers d lites and men s slip on to support our domestic business we ran multiple marketing campaigns and add the following commercials during the holiday season for women a skechers d lite campaign skechers sport and skechers gowalk joy for men sport and casual slip on spots starring tony romo and sport and casual wide width footwear featuring howie long for kids we ran commercials on children s programming for our lighted footwear and twinkle toes and on golf broadcast and networks our go golf spot featuring our

trends we have begun shipping spring 2019 product and are looking forward to sell throughs for spring as well as account relations or reactions to our new autumn winter 2019 collection international wholesale remains our single largest distribution channel and continues to represent the largest share of our total sales at 44 3 in the fourth quarter our international wholesale business increased by 18 4 for the quarter this increase was the result of double digit growth in our subsidiary joint venture and distributor businesses china contributed significantly with gains of 21 5 or 27 2 on a constant currency basis our international sales including both wholesale and retail increased 17 9 for the quarter and 19 2 for the year and represented over 55 of our sales in the fourth quarter further detailing our international growth for the quarter our wholly owned international subsidiary business grew by 14 4 and our joint venture wholesale business by 19 5 for the quarter the significant dollar gains came from germany spain japan and peru within our subsidiaries and china india malaysia and singapore within our joint ventures china remains the largest country within our international portfolio with an annual sales increase of 29 1 and approximately 22 8 million pairs shipped in the full year at the close of the year in china we had 876 skechers freestanding stores a total of 2 390 points of sale and a 53 increase in our annual online sales to support our growing business we broke ground on an approximately 1 6 million square foot distribution center and logistics facility the facility is expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2020 our international distributor business increased 19 7 in the quarter primarily due to strong gains from indonesia russia turkey and the middle east and despite sizable headwinds in the first half of the year our international distributor sales increased 0 8 for the full year by quarter end there were 2 306 skechers branded stores owned and operated by international distribution partners joint ventures and a network of franchisees in the fourth quarter 195 third party owned stores opened including our first locations in cyprus northen cyprus and tanzania additional stores opened include 105 in china 24 in india six in australia five each in thailand and taiwan four each in south korea and spain three each in hong kong indonesia and vietnam two each in croatia honduras malaysia mexico norway and the philippines and one each in brazil canada cambodia colombia egypt england greece iraq macau netherlands northern ireland paraguay serbia singapore switzerland turkey ukraine and uruguay 40 third party stores closed in the fourth quarter 25 third party owned skechers stores have opened so far in the first quarter and three have closed which brings us to 2 328 third party owned stores as of today in 2019 we expect to open in excess of 500 third party owned skechers branded stores in the remainder of the year we continue to see international as the biggest growth opportunity for the company which is why we have transitioned india from a joint venture to a wholly owned subsidiary with approximately 220 skechers retail stores of which just over 60 are wholly owned and a new e commerce platform india was one of our fastest growing markets in 2018 with another 80 to 100 stores planned for 2019 we see great potential to grow our business in this country of 1 3 billion people and believe this will be accretive to our diluted earnings per share in 2019 mexico was another attractive growth opportunity for the skechers brand which is why we ve reached an agreement in principle to establish a joint venture with our current distribution partner operating more than 70 stores today we believe this market can support significant additional growth over the coming years when complete we believe that this transaction will also be accretive to earnings in our company owned global retail business sales increased 7 5 in the fourth quarter which was the result of sales increases of 3 3 on domestic retail stores and 15 9 in our international store which on a constant currency basis was 20 4 worldwide comp store sales increased 1 1 in the quarter which was the result of a 3 increase in our international stores and a 0 4 in our domestic sales for the full year sales increased 12 which was the result of an increase of 7 7 in our domestic retail stores and 21 2 in our international stores domestically our gross margins increased by 450 basis points in the quarter and by 160 basis points for the full year due to improved pricing and a decrease in promotional activity our domestic e commerce business continued to grow in 2018 by 8 9 for the quarter and 11 6 for the year we expect to launch improved functionality accessibility and user interfaces this year and also roll out company owned sites in more countries at year end we had 692 company owned skechers retail stores of which 222 were outside the united states in the fourth quarter we opened 11 stores five in the u s four in the uk and one each in peru and italy we also remodeled five stores relocated five stores and expanded three locations to date in this first quarter we have opened two stores and closed four bringing us to 690 company owned stores in 2019 we expect to open approximately 70 to 80 stores not including the india stores that we ll be opening and remodel relocate or expand an additional 20 to 30 existing stores now i ll turn the call over to john to review our financials john vandemore chief financial officer thank you david in the fourth quarter sales increased 11 4 over the prior year to 1 08 billion and represented a new fourth quarter record for the company it is especially gratifying that this growth was driven by contributions from each of our business segments international wholesale increased 18 4 which included a 19 5 increase in our joint ventures a 19 7 increase in our distributor business and a 14 4 increase from our wholly owned subsidiaries company owned global retail same store sales increased 7 5 the result of a 3 3 increase in domestic retail including e commerce and a 15 9 increase in international retail domestic wholesale increased 4 8 on previous calls we highlighted our expectation that foreign exchange rates would become a headwind in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the front half of 2019 for the quarter foreign exchange rates negatively impacted sales by 22 3 million or roughly 230 basis points of growth total sales on a constant currency basis grew 13 7 year over year gross profit was 515 7 million up 61 6 million compared to the prior year and gross margin increased over 90 basis points to 47 7 this improvement was attributable to stronger domestic wholesale and retail margins which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate sg a expenses grew 32 1 million or 7 9 this quarter within that selling expenses decreased 2 1 million to 61 8 million or 5 7 of sales which was a 90 basis point improvement from 6 6 of sales in the prior year general and administrative expenses were up 34 2 million to 375 million as a percentage of sales this was a 40 basis point improvement from 35 1 in the prior year to 34 7 this quarter the dollar increase reflects volume gains internationally as well as continued investment in our long term global growth initiative this included 8 8 million to support continued double digit growth in china it also included an increase of 9 4 million in retail from 47 additional company owned skechers stores worldwide of which 11 opened in the fourth quarter and 9 7 million related to domestic and corporate operations including increased distribution related costs driven by higher volume earnings from operations increased 50 4 versus the prior year to 83 7 million operating margin improved 200 basis points to 7 7 versus 5 7 in the prior year period our income tax rate for the quarter was 18 4 compared with 194 4 in the prior year period as a reminder our prior year rate included the impact of the then recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act excluding the discrete impact of that tax law change our prior year income tax rate would have been 12 2 our current year effective tax rate reflects our final assessment of the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 14 and 18 net income for the fourth quarter was 47 4 million or 0 31 per diluted share on 155 million shares outstanding compared to a net loss of 66 7 million or 0 43 per diluted share on 156 1 million shares outstanding in the prior year period in december 2017 we recorded an income tax expense of 99 9 million representing 0 64 per diluted share due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act excluding that discreet tax item our adjusted net earnings in the fourth quarter of the prior year were 33 3 million or 0 21 per diluted share therefore on an adjusted basis our current year net income and earnings per diluted share grew 42 3 and 47 6 respectively during the fourth quarter we acquired approximately 1 7 million shares of our class a common stock at a cost of 42 million representing an average price of 25 22 per share since announcing our share repurchase program last year we have acquired almost 3 7 million shares at a cost of 100 million representing an average price of 27 34 per share at december 31 2018 50 million remained available under our existing repurchase authorization as we have stated before we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to fund our growth initiatives while continuing to return cash to shareholders our actions this past year reflect that confidence as well as our firm belief that skechers recent share price meaningfully undervalues our current earnings and cash flow profile as well as our long term growth prospects and now turning to our balance sheet at december 31 2018 we had 1 07 billion in cash cash equivalents and investments which was an increase of 312 2 million or 41 4 from december 31 2017 our cash and investments represented approximately 6 94 per diluted share outstanding at december 31 2018 trade accounts receivable at quarter end were 501 9 million an increase of 96 million from december 31 2017 and our dsos as of december 31 2018 were 36 days versus 32 days in 2017 total inventory including merchandise in transit was 863 3 million a decrease of 1 1 or 9 8 million from the prior year period this reflects our diligent management of inventory levels globally while fulfilling the requirements for our growth expectations and expanded retail store base long term debt was 88 1 million compared to 71 1 million at december 31 2017 primarily reflecting borrowings associated with the construction of our new distribution center in china working capital increased 114 2 million to approximately 1 62 billion versus 1 51 billion at december 31 2017 primarily reflecting higher accounts receivable levels as well as increased cash and investment balances capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately 45 6 million of which 19 3 million related to the construction of our distribution center in china 15 9 million related to 11 new company owned domestic and international store openings and six store remodels and 8 3 million related to our international wholesale operations in 2019 we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately 275 million to 300 million this includes an additional 70 to 80 company owned retail stores and 20 to 30 store remodels expansions or relocations this also includes the construction of our new distribution center in china enhancement to our existing distribution centers in the united states and europe and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in california now turning to our guidance we currently expect first quarter sales will be in the range of 1 275 billion to 1 3 billion and net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of 0 70 to 0 75 this guidance takes into account the impact of the existing foreign exchange headwinds and a shift in some sales from the first to the second quarter due to the timing of easter this year it includes the estimated impact of our investments in india but does not include the benefit of our pending joint venture in mexico it is also important to point out that in last year s first quarter we benefited from a discreet tax item associated with the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act which represented 0 07 per diluted share we currently expect no such impact in the first quarter of 2019 i will now turn the call back to david for closing remarks david weinberg chief operating officer thank you john in 2018 we achieved several records most importantly record annual sales of 4 64 billion record operating income as well as record shipments from our distribution centers in north and south america europe and japan our growth in the year came despite foreign currency headwinds economic and political challenges in several markets and tough comparisons due to the strength of our sales in 2017 we believe the growth is attributable to our diverse product range which is focused on style comfort quality and innovation at an affordable price we are pleased that the year brought growth in both our heritage looks as well as newer looks from skechers cali bobs from skechers men s sport and casual among others we continue to invest in our brand through the opening of skechers retail stores ending the year at 2 998 companies company owned and third party owned stores with the opening of stores in the first quarter we now have more than 3 000 skechers stores around the world further we are planning to unveil a fully upgraded skechers e commerce site in the united states and several other countries in the second half of 2019 we continue to believe international holds the greatest growth potential and to this end this week we completed the repurchase of the minority stake of our india joint venture transitioning it to a subsidiary and are in the process of transitioning our mexico distributor to a joint venture we believe these efforts will be accretive to earnings as always we will remain focused on efficiently growing our business and are pleased that our efforts resulted in both record annual sales and earnings in 2018 and believe we can continue to achieve strong results in 2019 and with that i would like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of the conference call questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of laurent vasilescu from macquarie group please proceed with your question laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my questions congrats on solid results i wanted to follow up on the china numbers they looked particularly strong in the fourth quarter how do we think about china for 2019 david weinberg chief operating officer well we see continued growth and while it s in our numbers and guidance for the first quarter it s understated by the significant difference in currency so while they ll be up significant double digits well at least double digits as far as we can see in local currency and in pairs shipped there will only be a slight increase in volume unless something changes significantly but we think as we go through the year the currency will sort of not have as great an impact and will continue to show significant double digit growth as we move into the balance of the year laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst very helpful and then on gross margins john maybe you can help us maybe walk to the drivers of the fourth quarter gross margin and how do we think about the first quarter gross margin john vandemore chief financial officer the fourth quarter gross margins were strong on the back of as we said domestic wholesale and retail performance as we have mentioned previously in the retail environment we had reduced some discounting activity and taking some limited pricing that continues to power through the retail business and they performed exceedingly well on a gross margin basis we also saw favorable trends in our domestic wholesale business both in terms of average price up and then costs down so we saw good mix trends there the offset as we mentioned was foreign exchange but again good solid performance on the margin basis going through our domestic businesses which i think speaks to the health overall of our domestic businesses when you include both the retail and the wholesale portion and obviously that speaks to the health of the consumer for us which has been performing well as you look at early 2019 we expect some modest improvement in q1 it remains to be seen exactly how material that is based on mix but we definitely expect some slight improvement in q1 i would only caveat as david mentioned that the foreign exchange rate again will continue to bedevil us over the first half of 2018 and in some of our core markets like china where the exchange rate differential is pretty severe in the first quarter based on what we know today laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst very helpful and then if i could squeeze one last one in international g a i think just backing out it looks like increased by 15 9 million half of that is china how do we think about that line item over the course of the first quarter and then potentially for the full year john vandemore chief financial officer well we re not going to give country specific guidance but i think what you saw in the fourth quarter was really probably more driven by volume gains as we ve mentioned before the p l structure of china wherein our distribution partners are third party there does tend to be a correlation with volume gains so we definitely saw that in the fourth quarter and i would expect it to be roughly in line with volume gains going into 2019 although again in any given quarter we can see timing shifts as we saw over the course of 2018 so we d be conscientious of that as well laurent vasilescu macquarie group analyst very helpful thank you very much and best of luck john vandemore chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john kernan from cowen co please proceed with your question john kernan cowen and company analyst hi good afternoon guys congrats on a nice finish of the year david weinberg chief operating officer thank you john vandemore chief financial officer thanks john john kernan cowen and company analyst john can you just help us understand a little bit more about the first quarter and the implied top line guidance both for domestic wholesale and then the international piece as well i think there is some timing around easter that s moving numbers around as well so just any detail you can give us there would be very helpful thanks john vandemore chief financial officer yes so i mean and obviously the easter timing kind of put a question mark at the end of the quarter as to exactly how things shake out what we see at the moment is probably a flat to maybe slightly down domestic environment again part of that is timing associated with the holiday part of that is i think the continued retail shakeout we see in terms of international international will be a bit of a mixed bag we actually expect following a tough q1 last year that our distributor business will come back probably be high single digits low teens type performance and that s counterbalanced with the modest single digit growth internationally which i would tell you if it were are not for foreign exchange would be almost double because again we really seeing the headwinds come in our key markets in the first half of 2019 and then our retail business we believe will be a high single digit maybe low double digit number depending upon retail performance we are seeing good trends thus far this year certainly in the domestic market but there s a lot of selling to be done still so that s generally how we believe it shakes out that gives us kind of on an average basis again taking into account the fx probably a mid single digit number maybe a little bit lower than that maybe a little bit higher depending on things how how things mix out but again that would be almost double that if it weren t for foreign exchange john kernan cowen and company analyst sure that s helpful thank you i guess when you look to for a holiday for 2019 both for domestic and international i know you re not giving a full year guidance but just any detail on how those order books are starting to shake out you did exit the fourth quarter with an acceleration both in international wholesale and domestic wholesale so one would think that your partners are feeling pretty good in terms of orders for next fall david weinberg chief operating officer we re right in the middle of that process as we speak we have had very good pre lines and very good feedback the orders are starting to come in now we had a very good january on top of what was a significantly high growth incoming order rate last january so that makes it look even more solid so we re getting good reception and we re getting good sell throughs from the current line that s out there so i think we all here feel very positive about this transition into fall holiday and potentially even increased acceleration as we get there john kernan cowen and company analyst all right great congrats on a good 2018 and best of luck guys operator our next question comes from the line of lauren cassel from morgan stanley please proceed with your question lauren cassel morgan stanley analyst great thanks so much maybe could you guys talk about 4q performance within domestic wholesale by bucket so off price versus big box versus family channel how did those different areas perform and how are you thinking about each of those different channels to perform generally in 2019 john vandemore chief financial officer well i could definitely talk to q4 2019 is a little bit of a prognostication i would say generally we saw continued trends in the off price again keep in mind how you define off price matters for us we are looking at those that sell traditionally either liquidated inventory from others for us it s made for product or some in line product that fits their pricing portfolio we did see continued weakness in that based on really the trend we had been seeing since q2 although it did decline a bit outside of that though generally activity was pretty strong certainly we had some exceptional items going through the holiday that performed very well and that lifted some categories for us but generally i d say outside of kind of the off price channel which is again been a bit of a challenge over the back half of 2018 things were positive looking forward we continue to see as david mentioned strong interest in the product strong response from the lines that they ve seen and the lines they re booking on now however i d just caveat that the retail environment in united states has certainly seen its share of attrition in both stores and doors so i think that will have an impact what i think we ve been very pleased with is that for our key accounts we ve seen certainly in 18 growth and early 19 good indications that they re going to continue to grow lauren cassel morgan stanley analyst ok great thank you and then just within the 0 4 comp in the u s during the quarter just any commentary on full price versus the outlet stores there john vandemore chief financial officer well again keep in mind in the middle of the year we decided to change approaches in particular and probably most pronounced in our concept stores and if you really look at the detail underneath the store performance that s where you saw slightly lower comp store performance but again that s against the backdrop of delivering significantly better margin and actually gross margins were up in every single one of our store types it was just it was most pronounced in the concept sides of things so and again we re incredibly pleased with that response from a financial perspective and you are seeing good general activity in the domestic market which i think is probably for us when we think about the consumer a more important vantage point and david mentioned the domestic business grew and when you combine the retail and the wholesale in the quarter and that i think speaks to the consumer interest where that s going next year still remains to be seen because there s a lot of selling but we re not changing our approach and so i would probably suggest you ll see at least in the early part of the year some of the same trends again good gross margin performance and maybe that costs us a few on comp store sales points on a in some of our stores but generally speaking a very good financial result at the end of the day lauren cassel morgan stanley analyst ok thanks so much john vandemore chief financial officer sure operator our next question comes from the line of jay sole from ubs please proceed with your question jay sole ubs analyst great thank you i wanted to follow up on sg a john can you give us an idea of how you re thinking about sg a dollar growth for q1 and then also maybe in general terms how you re thinking about it for fiscal 19 john vandemore chief financial officer yes again keeping in mind that a portion certainly in the international side is volume driven it somewhat depends on the top line basically what we believe we ll see in the early part of the year is you ll still see growth in the sg a category but it will continue to moderate as compared to kind of last year s numbers once you x out the volume gains so the volume drives activity and that s certainly the kind of activity we want to see we re not planning for anything drastic in kind of a change year over year as a percentage of sales all things considered maybe some shifts between buckets or between categories within the totality of sg a but more than anything else right now i think what we re aiming for is stability against the backdrop of the growth that we see because keep in mind when you grow even though an fx adjusted growth rate is smaller when you talk about activities like pairs which have to move through the system you don t always get the full benefit of alignment kind of top line behavior in the sg a and in particular distribution related costs so there s some offset there but i would probably guide that you re looking at stability in that as a kind of overall percentage going into the first quarter jay sole ubs analyst ok and then maybe just to follow up there s been big investment been talked about in china headquarters los angeles that kind of stuff is there is all that in the base right now and as you look out into your budget for 19 are there any new big projects whether it be commerce upgrade or some capability some big projects that might cause a jump in sg a as you go through the year john vandemore chief financial officer yes but not those that you ve mentioned and just to be abundantly clear all the projects that we mentioned kind of from the capex side which is everything from the distribution center in china all the way through to consolidating our footprint here in california those are all capital projects for the year so they won t have a direct or not a sizable direct p l impact what will ultimately impact the p l and be visible in categories like sg a will be when we begin consolidating the joint venture that we ve agreed in principle to form in mexico we don t have a good gauge right now on specific timing when we do we ll obviously give some clarity on that but once we begin consolidating those results we will take on board all the sg a all the revenue the gross margin associated with that business again we believe it will be accretive but you will see dollar gains in those categories as we on board those costs outside of that there s really nothing of significance i would call your attention to at this point in time jay sole ubs analyst ok got it thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of jim duffy from stifel please proceed with your question jim duffy stifel financial corp analyst thank you good afternoon everyone very nice profitability in the quarter nice to see that including the sg a leverage john can you maybe spell out the accretion opportunity from the india jv consolidation my understanding is that was a business that was running close to breakeven are you expecting to get to a leverage point there john vandemore chief financial officer yes so i mean just to be abundantly clear on india so it s been a joint venture so it s been fully consolidated in our operation from the get go what you will see now with the acquisition of the minority stake is lower relative takeaway on the minority interest side of things early at the moment but i would say we believe it s probably a couple of pennies on the year obviously that depends entirely on how the business performs and that is another market where we have seen significant fx headwinds but it s contributing so i think it ll probably be a couple of pennies on the year maybe more if things go slightly better than planned jim duffy stifel financial corp analyst ok and then with respect to the gross margin can you speak to what you re seeing from input costs with pardon me with some currency relief in china does that suggest an opportunity into the back half of the year john vandemore chief financial officer we re adjusting input costs on kind of a constant basis almost by shoe if you will so we adjust that as we go we did see some cost alleviation in the quarter that was reflected as i mentioned in some of the domestic wholesale margin numbers but i would probably remark that generally speaking we re not seeing a lot of positives and we re not seeing a lot of negatives we are taking advantage of currencies when we can along the way but you got to keep in mind that that s also bit of a double edged sword because when the currencies move the opposite direction you don t want to give that back so we re conscientious of that in the context of how we develop product so i would say it s been probably a modest to slight net benefit up through this point in time but more on a rolling basis and then keep in mind also that the style mix changes so significantly as you bring new shoes on it s really tough to completely compare that question apples to apples jim duffy stifel financial corp analyst fair enough thank you john vandemore chief financial officer thank you jim operator our next question comes from the line of sam poser from susquehanna please proceed with your question sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my questions a couple of things with the easter shift won t that shift some of your selling expenses from q1 to q2 and also move a good amount of the dtc sales i mean the big will dtc be affected by that john vandemore chief financial officer so on the second part of your question yes the direct to consumer sales are influenced and we ve we factored that into the guidance we ve given as best as we can tell at the moment sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so i was a little confused when you were walking through it i mean how we should think about the direct to consumer sales in the first quarter sort of taking that shift into account you re sort of walking through it david weinberg chief operating officer so in the previous numbers i gave sam we ve already kind of adjusted out what we believe the impact from the easter shift is both in terms of the dtc numbers most significantly in our retail base and elsewhere sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so what i m saying that you sort of walked through how you expect the domestic wholesale and international wholesale and then you add that dtc increase in q1 so i wanted to get a little more clarification on i think you said something about the like mid single in q1 but that seems a bit aggressive given the shift and the comparison gap john vandemore chief financial officer well again where we re going to see the dtc impact most significantly will be in our retail base and as i ve previously mentioned we expect retail right now for q1 to be kind of a high single digit contributor and that includes what we believe to be the impact for the shift of easter into q2 sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst so you expect it to increase around 9 like 7 to 9 is that the way to think about it john vandemore chief financial officer for q1 yes david weinberg chief operating officer that includes the new stores as well sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst gotcha and then secondly when you when those when what is the tax rate that you re assuming for the first quarter is it john vandemore chief financial officer yes again we re expecting a range of between 14 and 18 for the full year it should be relatively evenly applied throughout the year absent any discrete tax items changes in law etc so i think at the moment planning for a relatively flat midpoint rate is certainly a decent assumption that being said again we re still looking for regulatory opinions on some aspects of the recently enacted tax law and how those are applied but i d say generally we think that s a reliable estimate at this juncture sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst and in q4 you i mean it looks like your u s profitability was at a rate higher than international so do you expect that to continue into q1 which would likely drive the tax rate a little bit higher john vandemore chief financial officer no we don t think there ll be a meaningful impact on the composition of the revenue streams in q1 that will change that tax guidance sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst and then lastly on india when those 200 plus stores hit your store base how does that impact the sales or is that already in it s just going to change with sales david weinberg chief operating officer that s already in the franchises remain franchises the owned stores remain owned stores when you go in the big shift you ll see is in the minority interest and the share of the profitability and i would say because there was a question that they were unprofitable through this year that the fact is that they did break into profitability last year and we expect that to increase this year sam poser susquehanna financial group analyst thank you very much john john vandemore chief financial officer thanks sam operator our next question comes from the line of jeff van sinderen from b riley fbr please proceed with your question jeff van sinderen b riley fbr analyst first let me add my congratulations and then just to clarify you mentioned stability in sg a in q1 i think do you feel like you have an opportunity to leverage as a percentage of sales later in the year john vandemore chief financial officer yes so just to be abundantly clear about the stability comment i m looking at overall sg a as a percentage of sales and again keeping in mind that a significant portion of in particular the international sg a growth you ve seen recently has been volume driven yes we think we are looking for stability from a kind of rate perspective in the early part of the year i mean there s always opportunities and we re we aggressively pursue those opportunities as they come forward but there s also risks in the business and we want to maintain the ability to respond to those so again i think at the moment what i would probably guide you to is something that is stable as a percentage of sales to last year jeff van sinderen b riley fbr analyst ok fair enough and then how should we think about growth and i know india and mexico have been strong growth areas but maybe you can touch on the growth you re expecting there in 2019 as you kind of are transforming those and then any investments that we should think about that you might need to make in those regions in 2019 john vandemore chief financial officer yes i don t want to get into again country specific growth profiles i ll just point out that india was one of our fastest growing segments countries over the last really two years certainly from a on a percentage basis and continues to perform exceedingly well that was in part our rationale for taking the action we did to bring it in as a wholly owned subsidiary now so we certainly think that there remains significant opportunity to grow that market and we believe that in house it will quite frankly grow faster as a wholly owned subsidiary than it would otherwise be able to grow there may be some modest investments but nothing of the scale that i think would be bear worth calling out at the moment mexico i definitely agree that it s been a good business for us for the brand we believe together with our distribution our existing distribution partner that it can grow faster and better there were probably again be some limited investments there but it will be with an eye toward growing the brand growing the brand presence in the market we ll have better indication on that once we ve an eye toward exactly when we expect the transaction to close but suffice it to say again it was part of the underlying rationale for taking the action we did we felt we could grow it better together in a joint venture format than we d be able to see otherwise so given the attractiveness of that market it will certainly warrant some investment consideration along the way but again nothing of the scale outside of the original investment into the joint venture that i would point out and just to be clear about that it s an operating business today with our distribution partner there are existing stores as we mentioned so in this instance we are buying into to form the joint venture and then grow it from there as partners jeff van sinderen b riley fbr analyst ok understood thanks for taking my questions and best of luck in q1 john vandemore chief financial officer thanks jeff operator our next question comes from the line of chris svezia from wedbush please proceed with your question chris svezia wedbush securities analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the finish to the year david weinberg chief operating officer thanks john vandemore chief financial officer thanks chris chris svezia wedbush securities analyst u s wholesale so i m just curious q4 i think the initial guidance was high single low double you did four and change saw a 5 growth was anything unique happened in the quarter either just i don t know just why did it come in at that level versus maybe what you expected any color about that john vandemore chief financial officer yes i d say what you probably saw a little more continuance of the off price deficit that we have seen in q2 in q3 i mean not extraordinary but it was a little bit weaker than we even thought we re beginning to see new signs of recovery and it didn t come through i think at the level that we had hoped i would also point out that in q4 we were comping against an incredible kids number last year from energy lights it was one of our top five styles last year in q4 and it just had a tough comparable so that was probably a little bit weaker than we anticipated but again i d generally say we were looking for growth in the quarter against kind of the retail backdrop that we saw and some of the traffic numbers that we saw impacting our retail partners that was we still think the growth that we showed was good growth taking advantage of the market and the product strength given those two other considerations i mentioned david weinberg chief operating officer yes and as part of that there s a shift as well from in pricing because the pair information was up mid to high single chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok when i so when i think about you have full sales like authority you talked about maybe flat to down in q1 i guess you make that back up a bit in q2 just any thoughts about how we think about u s wholesale growth for the year seems like kid s has been a little bit softer given the comparison women s i guess depends in what category men s has been strong i guess but just what kind of growth rate we should think about for u s wholesales as we kind of think about the year and moving forward john vandemore chief financial officer yes i mean we sit here with kind of half the year fully vetted with customers and as david pointed out initial orders getting booked now for the back half of the year so it s fairly early to make a full forecast for the year what i would tell you though is we think it s a single digit environment from a domestic wholesale at the moment again against the backdrop of store counts dwindling door counts coming down so i think that s probably the best guide but again i think it s really early and it s tough to tell i would also point out for you just for context we actually saw women s and men s grow this quarter and that was a good sign kid s obviously facing the really difficult comparable given the energy lights phenomena the year before was the only gender category that we saw a decline in the quarter so that was good and reassuring chris svezia wedbush securities analyst and on western europe maybe just talk about what s going on there u k germany some of the other markets broadly speaking take out the currency out of the equation obviously currency is a bit of headwind here near term but what s going on in those markets how has your business been holding up pricing just any color about how we should think about western europe as we go forward david weinberg chief operating officer western europe continues to be a very positive piece for us and we will certainly on a local currency basis grow in the first quarter on top of what s a very good first quarter last year we re actually shipping quite well for january and february we the environment is probably slightly better for growth purposes from germany although the u k will remain our largest u k had some internal issues at the retail level with some bankruptcies and reshuffling and they will continue to grow and they re already the largest to begin with but i would tell you that we would anticipate growth in just about every country in europe on a local currency basis western europe anyway chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok last question i have is just on mexico just any thoughts or can you share with us how big that potentially could be what s the size and i know you haven t disclosed timing but is this sort of a second quarter is it going to happen shortly in the first quarter or just any color about timing on that john vandemore chief financial officer yes we ve been working on it diligently recently we hope that it will close this quarter but it s taking an operating business and forming a joint venture so it s not as easy as starting from scratch because you re dealing with existing components so our anticipation at the moment is that by the end of the quarter we ll be able to close but i would at this point i think quite frankly it s just a little bit too early for us to be able to commit with in any degree of reliability to a timing number chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok and john that s not in your numbers right john vandemore chief financial officer correct we have excluded it from all the guidance at this point in time and we will update you when we have an idea as to the close and we will accordingly update guidance if necessary chris svezia wedbush securities analyst ok thank you very much all the best john vandemore chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from the line of omar saad from evercore please proceed with your question unidentified speaker hi guys this is west on for omar a question on your e commerce business you had mentioned you were going to roll out new functionality really put more of an emphasis behind the e commerce can you expand on that a little bit what pieces do you think you really need to improve to really get that business growing kind of in line with some of your peers and then also they re going to be more domestically focused or are there things you re doing abroad as well thank you john vandemore chief financial officer yes i don t want to go into a ton of detail because it s probably too microscopic for everyone but i would say we and actually this started a year ago so or may be even before that really we have been investing in our digital assets our digital capabilities everything from digital marketing all the way through to what will be a complete replatform of our commerce user interface so that s in process it involves for us working with external partners who are expert in this building off of what we have today but creating i think a more comprehensive solution again everything from encompassing everything from digital marketing all the way through to actual e commerce i would characterize it as a focus at the moment on domestic solution but it s with the goal of having as close to a turnkey solution as we can for our global operations so that we can bring similar solutions to our international markets because some of the same trends you re seeing domestically are beginning to emerge internationally with regards to e commerce i just also want to note as an exception to that today china is already far far ahead of many of its competitors and doing exceedingly well in e commerce it grew over 50 this year so when we talk about e commerce it definitely depends on which market you re speaking about but china is already a significant e commerce business for us and continues to do very very well unidentified speaker ok perfect and then just secondly i know you guys have been rolling out more fashion forward product more kind of branding going into specialty and doing some apparel as you think about continuing to build that are you seeing some traction in the brand recognition moving the customer younger any kind of metrics you could have there how it s evolving how the view how the brand overall is viewed domestically and abroad thanks david weinberg chief operating officer we only see more and more increases and more exception more acceptance to the brand i think on a worldwide basis we continue to push the brand and to newer styles and to newer looks and continue to trend significantly younger and it s now beginning to happen in the u s as well so we are all positive about our brand offerings our product offerings and anticipate we will solidify a significantly larger demographic but we are getting more brand acceptance everywhere in the world unidentified speaker that s great good work guys and good luck on the next year david weinberg chief operating officer thanks john vandemore chief financial officer thank you operator our final question comes from the line of tom nikic from wells fargo please proceed with your question tom nikic wells fargo analyst hey everybody thanks for squeezing me in at the end here john just a quick one on the buyback i think you ve already used up a pretty significant portion of the authorization should we assume that you ll sort of keep buying back stock and when it expires you ll look to reup and just kind of thinking how should we think about that thanks john vandemore chief financial officer yes i mean that s almost precisely how we think about it i mean our activity year to date has been a reflection of where we see value and we ve seen tremendous value in the share price skechers as i mentioned we think is undervalued plain and simple so we took the action that was available to us we will continue to pursue completion of the program we have based on the prevailing prices in the market and then we ll go from there i mean it s an ongoing dialog we have with regards to capital allocation so it will definitely be a component of what we talk about with the board going forward and certainly as we near completion of the program that we d put in place last year tom nikic wells fargo analyst all right thanks very much best of luck this year john vandemore chief financial officer thank you tom operator we ve reached the end of the question and answer session and i will now turn the call over to skechers for closing remarks
