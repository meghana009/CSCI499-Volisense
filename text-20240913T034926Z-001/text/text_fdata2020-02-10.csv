update 12 02 the who have announced the official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus as covid 19 the coronavirus is clearly the main issue for the markets nowadays says gittler everyone is expecting the global economy to improve during 2020 as the us china trade war comes under control a bit the us elections are not yet a threat on the horizon and even if bernie sanders the democratic front runner and the most left wing candidate actually wins several security firms and political pundits have put out research notes pointing out that his more radical programs will never get through congress anyway otherwise currencies were relatively quiet we re back to risk on as us stocks closed higher and most of asia is up too including 0 7 in shanghai and 1 4 in shenzhen update 11 02 the markets attention will be on central bank speakers today and any insight to their thinking on the economic impact from the virus although it still seems too early to have an informed opinion say analysts at lloyds on tuesday the uk declared the coronavirus an imminent threat and the world health organization who warned of concerning transmission in europe says marshall gittler bdswiss continued concerns over global impact of coronavirus have seen most asian equity markets outside of china start this week lower china stabilises domestic markets by pumping liquidity into money markets largest fx losses to date have been the commodity currencies australian new zealand canadian dollars biggest threat to the global economy remains a breakdown in international co operation and increase in barriers to both trade and tourism after an initial panic response global markets are now taking a more nuanced stance to reflect differing potential impacts asian economies will be most vulnerable and regional currencies have weakened sharply equity markets have recovered on expectations that key central banks will ease policy if necessary growth fears have undermined commodity prices and currencies linked to commodity exports advertisement after an initial panic in financial markets signs of stability have started to emerge say economists at ing there s hope the coronavirus will be contained and that stimulus measures will mitigate the economic damage but there s no question the outbreak will take a toll on global growth the consequences for china s economy and thus ultimately also for the global economy still cannot be adequately evaluated says marc andr√© fongern head of fx research keynote speaker at maf global forex further rate cuts in order to appropriately address the obvious downside risks are likely to be inevitable coronavirus deaths surpass sars outbreak the number of coronavirus cases has continued to increase with the latest official data putting the total at over 40 000 as at february 9th during the weekend a notable milestone was reached with the number of cases exceeding those in the 2003 sars outbreak the official death toll has increased to over 900 compared to below 800 for sars given that the coronavirus has a much lower mortality rate than sars it illustrates that the number of cases is substantially higher there are of course other unofficial estimates of the number of cases which are substantially higher one chinese exile resident in the us stated that the true number of cases in wuhan could be 1 5mn with 50 000 deaths given evidence of leaked data from local cremation centres the number of international cases has increased only slowly and is still very limited with a total of 136 at this stage virus profile appears stable according to the world health organisation who there is no evidence of the virus mutating the mortality rate also appears relatively stable at just over 2 compared with near 10 for sars who officials reiterated that the virus is still concentrated in hubei province and praised the efforts of chinese officials it also appeared that the number of cases had stabilised slightly over the previous few days the limited number of cases outside china will help ease immediate fears there will however be fears that virus is highly contagious and can be passed on even when there are no symptoms present these factors will make it more difficult to contain the outbreak globally if the number of cases starts to increase sharply there are further travel restrictions in place with hong kong for example demanding that all visitors from the chinese mainland have to enter into a 14 day quarantine period china stabilises domestic markets china s central bank added huge amounts of liquidity into money markets which helped stabilise equities last week there were also reports that the central bank would cut interest rates the shanghai index gained 0 5 on monday and it 5 above lows recorded after the lunar new year re opening but it is 7 below the early january high but the chinese economy will take a big hit after an extended new year holiday chinese factories are due to return to work this week some important companies such as the foxconn facility have re opened there will however still be a number of closures and schools are not likely to re open until march 1st inflation pressures have also increased within china with the january cpi inflation rate increasing to 5 4 from 4 5 the previous month and above consensus forecasts of 4 9 and the fastest rate since october 2011 food prices increased 20 6 over the year with a renewed increase in pork prices on the month there is no doubt that there will be a large impact for the first quarter according to danske bank the extended holiday in many key manufacturing provinces will have a direct impact on production as there will be one week less of production in january february than usual the list keeps growing but at least six provinces have extended the holiday however some of the lost ground should be recovered in march and q2 assuming the virus becomes under control the service sector is likely to take an even bigger hit this time as many areas have already felt a more or less complete stop the service sector is far bigger today 55 of gdp than in 2003 42 retail is another sector that is feeling the pain as people stay home instead of visiting shopping malls one can only guess how big a hit gdp growth will take but we estimate a reduction of at least two percentage points in year on year growth is on the cards as this is what we saw during the sars outbreak this would lower q1 gdp growth to 4 y y or lower this could trigger a negative quarter on quarter rate in q2 followed by a sharp turn in q2 and q3 as production catches up and consumers make up for the money saved in q1 by spending more in the following quarters the comments illustrate that there is a very large degree of uncertainty over the potential gdp impact especially with an absence of hard data there will also inevitably be suspicions that official data will be massaged to show a less pronounced gdp slide according to westpac s economic team chinese gdp growth rate could drop to 2 in the first quarter from the fourth quarter s 6 if the coronavirus profile is similar to the sars experience that would push the full year growth rate down to 5 5 below the bank s current 5 8 forecast focus on global supply chains from a global industrial perspective the immediate impact will be on supply chains and difficulties in sourcing components from china us national economic adviser kudlow stated the impact of us corporate supply chains was minimal but there will be concerns that component shortages will have a negative impact and that the white house is being complacent there will however be knock on effects with south korean carmaker kia motors for example halting production at all south korean plant due to a shortage of components if chinese facilities face major difficulties in re starting production the supply chain fears will quickly escalate china s recovery profile will be crucial developments within china over the next few weeks and months will be extremely important in determining the overall impact one scenario is that there will be a v shaped pattern with a sharp gdp decline for the first quarter followed by a quick recovery if so the overall global impact will tend to be limited there is however the risk of a much less benign outcome as underlying damage is more sustained with only a flat outcome after the first quarter slide there will be important concerns over stresses within the banking sector according to stress tests conducted last year the number of bad loans within the economy would increase by around 400 if annual gdp growth slowed to 4 1 the coronavirus outbreak will certainly increase pressures on cash flow and the number of defaults will increase the banking industry is taking a big hit said you chun a shanghai based analyst at national institution for finance development the outbreak has already damaged china s most vibrant small businesses and if it prolongs many firms will go under and be unable to repay their loans serious stresses within the banking sector would make it much more difficult for the economy to recover according to mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz even as global authorities struggle to contain the spread of the coronavirus the market is modeling the economic impact in china as a v a sharp deceleration of growth this quarter followed by a strong rebound in the second as such many have argued that the best analytical approach is to look through the crisis treating its economic effects as containable temporary and reversible i sure hope this is right the global economy and in particular those countries with more fragile growth dynamics can ill afford a big shock that has adverse geopolitical and institutional spillovers unfortunately it is still early to declare with confidence the much hoped for v shaped evolution indeed given what i have called the cascading sudden stop dynamics of the coronavirus for china and beyond the risk of either a u or l shaped pattern for 2020 is still too high to dismiss global economic impact uncertain given their economic linkage to china asian economies will continue to be the most vulnerable to a sharp downturn in china the countries most vulnerable will be south korea japan thailand singapore vietnam and malaysia the overall international spread of the virus will however also be very important and not confined to asia the uk for example has raised its official guidance on the coronavirus threat there will inevitably be an important impact on global tourism given that chinese visits overseas amounted to 173mn in 2019 with spending totalling 250bn ihs said in a commentary on coronavirus outbreak coronavirus will have a larger negative effect on the global economy than the sars outbreak in 2003 at the time of sars china was the sixth largest economy accounting for only 4 2 of world gdp china is now the world s second largest economy accounting for 16 3 of world gdp therefore any slowdown in the chinese economy sends not ripples but waves across the globe if the current and unprecedented confinement measures in china stay in place until the end of february and are lifted progressively beginning in march the resulting economic impact will be concentrated in the first half of 2020 with a reduction of global real gdp of 0 8 in q1 and 0 5 in q2 it said in this scenario the coronavirus and resulting measures will reduce global real gdp by 0 4 in 2020 which data releases will need to be watched the coronavirus impact will not show up in official data for at least another week and china also postponed the january trade data as the january and february data will be reported together next month the flash global pmi readings will be released on february 21st with data for the euro zone japan uk and us the chinese pmi releases will be watched very closely with the official pmi data due for release on february 29th with the caixin manufacturing data on march 2nd and services sector data on march 4th pmi data for most asian economies including south korea thailand and taiwan will be released on march 2nd these releases will be very important in assessing the potential short term global impact and investment banks will look to re calibrate forecasts after these reports how have global markets reacted equity markets rallied strongly in the middle of last week amid hopes that the economic impact would be limited wall street indices posted fresh record highs and the pan european stoxx 600 index also posted a record high before a limited correction global markets were reassured by the latest us business confidence data which recorded a significant manufacturing improvement for january to a 6 month high back in expansion territory there are also strong expectations that global central banks will respond to any weakness by loosening monetary policy in particular wall street will expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates if confidence stumbles at this stage futures markets see a 14 chance of rates being cut at the march fed meeting with a 50 chance that rates will be cut by the end of june singapore prepared to loosen monetary policy the monetary authority of singapore had already stated that it is likely to loosen monetary policy by allowing the singapore dollar to weaken and there are also likely to be fiscal measures in the february 18th budget on friday the mas also raised its alert status to orange from yellow as it reported more cases not linked directly to previous infections or travel to china the mas also warned financial institutions to take additional measures and precautions against incidents such as elevated demand for cash the singapore dollar has weakened sharply to 5 month lows with usd sgd around 1 3900 thailand has also cut interest rates and other asian countries are likely to follow suit over the next few weeks commodities remain under pressure although global equities posted strong gains for the week oil prices were unable to follow suit even with opec sources suggesting that the cartel could act to put additional production cuts into effect opec s technical committee has proposed additional production cuts of 600 000 bpd but russia has not yet responded to these proposals wti declined to 4 month lows below 50 0 p b before a slight recovery with brent also posted 4 month lows near 54 0 p b during the week with no improvement on monday copper declined to a 4 month low before a marginal recovery iron ore is close to 15 below the early 2020 high but above 2019 lows australian dollar slides to 10 year lows there has been significant divergence within currency markets with commodity currencies notably vulnerable the australian dollar has been the main casualty among g10 currencies amid expectations of significant damage from the slide in commodity prices the damage has been greater than that seen during the us china trade war and aud usd has declined to a 10 year low below 0 67 the canadian and new zealand dollars have also been undermined by vulnerability in commodity prices even though domestic data releases have held firm nzd usd dipped to 2 month lows with usd cad at 2 month highs us dollar gains ground us economic data has remained solid reinforcing expectations that the us will continue to out perform globally in this context the dollar has attracted funds especially as it also has safe haven qualities with high liquidity the euro has lost ground given fears of further damage to the german manufacturing sector following very weak data for december sterling has lost ground with unease over the impact of global trade developments especially given expectations of tough trade negotiations with the eu the yen and swiss franc have weakened slightly from their strongest levels but have maintained a strong tone asian currencies have remained under pressure with the singapore dollar at 5 month lows while the thai baht has retreated to 7 month lows fx positioning in our last fx positioning commentary we highlighted how the risk off environment triggered by the coronavirus outbreak had still not been reflected in speculative positions say analysts at ing on monday this might have denoted a somewhat more sanguine approach amongst speculators but the latest cftc report highlights a decisive flight to safety as shown in the positioning overview below the biggest victims have been the commodity currencies australian new zealand canadian dollars looking at the spot movements and analysing the fundamentals aud and nzd are naturally more exposed than cad to the coronavirus story due to the strong ties of their respective countries to chinese activity also we have recently highlighted how aud is likely more vulnerable than nzd fear is still the major threat the biggest threat to the global economy remains a breakdown in international co operation and increase in barriers to both trade and tourism there has also been an increased focus in countering misinformation with the who warning against trolls and conspiracy theories according to director general ghebreyesus misinformation was making the work of our heroic workers even harder in this context diplomatic efforts and the work of national health authorities will have a crucial role to play especially if the number of global cases increases sharply
if you want a glimpse of the future head to santiago until recently the chilean capital was the beating heart of an economy lauded for its rapid growth rate and the speedy eradication of poverty a place so successful it was called an economic miracle and made a poster child for development by economists who urged others countries to replicate the chile model yet the city welcomed the new decade with intense protests as millions marched in its streets to protest rising inequality and the unaffordability of daily life this ongoing tumult represents a fall from grace that we need to understand since many other emerging economies are heading down the path first beaten by chile santiago is by far the biggest economic hub in chile with a population of 5 2 million it is home to a third of the chilean population is 10 times the size of the next largest city antofagasta and is the source of almost half of the country s economic output a poor country in the 1970s chile had a national income per person half of that in argentina
overview the global capital markets have begun the new week on a cautious tone as investors seek to assess the latest news on the new coronavirus nearly all the markets in asia fell but china european bourses are lower as well with the dow jones stoxx 600 off about 0 3 us shares are soft but little changed benchmark yields are slightly lower in europe after asia pacific bond yields eased to catch up the move in the us ahead of the weekend the us 10 year yield is around 1 57 the dollar has a heavier bias today slipping against most of the major currencies led by the norwegian krone on the back of a surprisingly strong inflation report emerging market currencies are also mostly higher with the chinese yuan and russian rouble vying for the top position with both up almost 0 3 after falling by 1 1 over the past two sessions the jp morgan emerging markets currency index is up by about 0 15 today late in the european morning gold is higher for the fourth consecutive sessions and oil is in a 50 cent range on either side of the 50 a barrel mark asia pacific reports suggest a mixed re opening of china s manufacturing companies some are extending the shutdown extension another week and others are suggesting not re starting until march manufacturing in china is labor intensive and there can be no work without masks two masks per day per worker are needed and reports suggest shortages separately reports indicate that officials have spent out half of the funds cny31 5 or 4 5 bln that have already been allocated cny 72 bln to combat the virus the pboc announced a new weekly facility to provide re lending funds to major banks and several local banks that will be re lend to businesses 100 bp below the one year loan prime rate of 3 15 china reported january cpi jumped to 5 4 from 4 5 in december economists had expected something a little shy of 5 food prices accelerated to 20 6 from 17 4 producer prices ended a six month deflationary bout and rose 0 1 year over year the news has little policy significance and does pick up the full impact of the coronavirus reports indicate that china s oil demand has fallen by about 3 2 mln barrel per day and as some industry re opens the decline could fall to around 2 5 mln bpd next month demand is projected to be about 1 4 mln bpd less than in q4 19 opec awaits russia s decision whether it will go along with an extension of existing cuts until the end of the year and some additional cuts in h1 20 meanwhile chinese commodity importers are declaring force majeure to turn back shipments including reports of 35 liquid natural gas cargoes australia reportedly may be the most impacted the dollar is in about a third of a yen range above jpy109 50 where a nearly 610 mln option is placed that expires today the 20 day moving average also comes in near there on the topside he jpy110 area capped upticks last week the australian dollar fell to a marginal new multi year low of 0 6660 before rebounding and briefly poking through 0 6700 before encountering new sales support is now pegged near 0 6680 and resistance is spotted around 0 6720 the dollar was turned back from cny7 0 and returned to the pre weekend low near cny6 9775 the cny6 95 area may offer a near term base europe the specter haunting europe is not socialism after all at least mixed economies or social markets prevail but nationalism in germany merkel succeeded in unwinding the selection of fdp s kemmerich as premier of thuringia to oust the left premier who seemed poised to continue leading a minority government with the support of the spd and greens kemmerich s ascension was only possible with the help of the nationalist afd for which all the major parties have renounced cooperating berlin insisted on enforcing the national pact on the local government by sheer power however a political vacuum in germany has opened as the dramatic decline in support for both the cdu and spd reflects a programmatic solution is necessary sooner or later meanwhile sinn fein s ability to recast itself as a populist nationalist force seemed to have struck paydirt in ireland its share of the vote appears to have jumped to a little more than 22 compared with 14 in 2016 aside from the hubris of small differences little separates the two main parties fine gael and the fianna fail which divided a little less than half of the vote the preliminary results suggest that sinn fein which ran candidates in 42 districts may have secured as many as 37 seats in the new parliament staying with the political theme german politics took a bigger turn than the local government in an east german state the national political situation was thrown open by the controversial head of the cdu annegret kramp karrenbauer akk merkel s handpicked successor indicating that she will step down and not replace merkel as the chancellor candidate akk and merkel appear to have had a falling out over several issues and it is not clear how much akk is being pushed but she does appear to have lost merkel s support italy joined germany france and spain in reporting shockingly poor industrial production figures for december germany france and spain reported last week and all widely missed estimates today it was italy s turn economists had expected a decline of around 0 6 and instead it plummeted by 2 7 on the month it was the worst since january 2018 and november s 0 1 gain was revised away italy s industrial output has not risen since august the data warns that 1 the economic downturn in q4 could be steeper than the 0 3 reported and 2 without improvement italy may have slipped into a recession two contracting quarters the political fallout could see more support for the league in spring local elections the euro has been confined to less than 10 ticks on either side of 1 0950 where an option for about 580 mln euros is set to expire today the lower yields and low volatility makes the euro an attractive funding currency for levered accounts sterling slipped to fresh 2 5 month lows near 1 2870 before finding a bid that helped it resurface above 1 29 there is an option for almost gbp380 stuck there that will be cut today the pre weekend high was near 1 2960 and a move above there would help lift the technical tone norway s january cpi was expected to be flat but some basket revisions and a jump in food prices say a 0 7 increase which lifted the year over year rate to 1 8 from 1 4 the underlying rate rose to 2 9 from 1 8 the data reinforces ideas that norway s central bank norges bank will keep policy steady the euro is testing support near nok10 10 sweden s riksbank meets this week and is expected to stand pat after hiking rates to zero at the end of last year the swedish krona has been sold for the norwegian krone today america it is a light diary for north america today three regional fed presidents speak today bowman daly and harker despite the dissents during last year s easing operation there is a consensus now and it favors a standpat policy however powell is likely to open the door to a possible ease at his congressional testimony that begins tomorrow the idea is that the coronavirus could impact the world economy given the size and linkages with china it could lead to a retrenchment of risk weigh on commodity prices and fuel further dollar appreciation the gap between the markets and the federal reserve interest rate expectations is wide the december 2020 fed funds futures imply 1 235 effective average compared with the current average near 1 59 canada reports january housing starts and december permits these are not the data that typically moves the market canada s employment data before the weekend was sufficient to keep expectations for the bank of canada steady a rate cut is still anticipated but not until later in q2 before mexico s central bank meets on feb 13 it will report industrial output figures for december continued weakness will underscore the likelihood of another rate cut mexico s high real and nominal rates underpin the peso which is among the best performing currencies this year and last although the us dollar managed to close above cad1 32 last week for the first time since last november it does not necessarily signal a breakout the greenback continues to consolidate the technical indicators remain stretched and about to turn lower we continue to look for a top around current levels a break of cad1 3260 would strengthen our conviction the dollar is trading in a narrow range off of the pre weekend high mxn18 8275 against the mexican peso initial support for the us dollar is seen near mxn18 70
note this live blog no longer is being updated by heritage foundation policy experts president donald trump s proposed budget for fiscal year 2021 would reduce the size and reach of the federal bureaucracy significantly by shifting government responsibilities back to constitutional priorities and empowering state and local governments these reforms contained in the request trump sent monday morning to congress would put the budget on track to balance and represent a significant first step toward reducing spending and stabilizing the nation s unsustainable debt however the president s proposal represents a missed opportunity in other areas namely it fails to propose significant reforms to social security and health care entitlement programs the main drivers of spending and debt growth the president s annual budget proposal should serve as a road map to congress for how the executive and legislative branches can work together to increase individual freedom and economic prosperity for all americans out of control federal spending is a threat to that freedom and prosperity the president must continue to lead the way and propose bolder reforms that not only will balance the budget in the short term but also put the government on a long term path to sustainability trump s budget request would 1 cut spending by 4 6 trillion and put the federal budget on a path to balance the president s budget includes 4 6 trillion in proposed spending cuts according to the administration this is the highest number of spending cuts a president ever has proposed in a sign of how unsustainable federal spending has become even with over 4 trillion in cuts the budget does not balance in 10 years the proposal does provide a path to balance though reducing deficits from nearly 5 of gross domestic product to less than 1 of gdp by 2030 the administration projects a surplus by 2035 with the gross national debt already surpassing the size of the economy there is no time to waste the trump administration should strive to balance the budget within 10 years 2 significantly reduce the federal bureaucracy over the past century the size and scope of the federal government has expanded well beyond the constitutional priorities envisioned by the founding fathers the president s 2021 budget makes significant progress in reducing the government s reach and returning power to the people the budget proposal includes 1 9 trillion in cuts to nondefense discretionary programs much of the nondefense discretionary budget includes waste duplication or overlap or funds programs that have no proper federal role to address these problems the president s budget proposes a 5 cut to nondefense programs rejecting the irresponsible bipartisan budget act of 2019 the budget proposes a 2 annual cut from 2022 to 2030 nondefense discretionary reforms alone won t balance the budget but they will help to ensure that the federal government focuses on truly national needs 3 prioritize national defense the president s budget proposes 740 5 billion in national defense spending consistent with the level provided by the bipartisan budget act of 2019 this is a 2 5 billion 0 3 increase compared to 2020 the budget realizes over 5 billion in savings within the operations of the department of defense which the administration reinvests in higher priorities such as nuclear modernization missile defense and increased readiness related president s budget makes immigration enforcement a priority the security of americans at home and abroad is perhaps the greatest responsibility of the federal government providing appropriated national defense funding should remain a top priority what s needed in the budget to stabilize spending and debt growth lawmakers must pursue bolder reforms one area where the president s budget falls short is in addressing the growth of entitlement spending last month the congressional budget office projected that annual medicare medicaid and social security spending will nearly double in the next decade consuming 59 of federal revenues by 2030 medicare and social security are unsustainable and both are on a path to insolvency the budget should propose fundamental reforms to these programs that will lower costs and return control over health care and retirement needs to the american people this proposal does not achieve that goal providing only modest reforms to health care programs and social security s disability insurance program it will be impossible to reduce spending and stabilize debt over the long term without reforming entitlement programs president must lead way trump s budget would reshape the federal government and refocus it toward constitutional priorities significantly reducing spending and balancing the budget in 15 years nevertheless there is much more work to be done the nation s long term debt trajectory is unsustainable and will negatively impact current and future generations the president s budget provides the groundwork to avert that future however he must continue to lead congress toward bigger and bolder reforms in the space below heritage foundation analysts dig into some of the specific aspects of the president s budget request individual tax cuts extended other pro growth reforms left out trump s budget proposal would keep taxes from automatically increasing on working americans as is currently scheduled for 2026 by extending the individual tax cuts from 2017 the budget would cut taxes by 1 4 trillion keeping taxes low for individuals is rightly a key priority for a taxpayer focused budget but the budget does not include similar protections for new business investments in american workers which begin to phase out at the end of 2022 first let s look at the individual protections that the budget would extend these are the same changes that cut taxes for 9 out of 10 taxpayers in 2018 and had significant benefits for americans in every income group the average american got a 1 400 tax cut in 2018 or 2 900 for a family of four to keep these benefits from reversing the budget would retain the federal income tax rates at the lower levels the larger standard deduction the doubled child tax credit and the capped deductions for state and local taxes among many other important reforms for businesses and their employees the budget would maintain the permanently lower corporate tax rate at 21 down from the 2017 global high of 35 this stands in contrast to leading democrats who want to increase the federal business tax rate as high as 42 about 10 percentage points higher than any other major country paired with lower rates the most pro growth reform of the 2017 tax cuts allowed businesses to write off many new investments immediately these rules for immediate expensing are left out of the budget proposal without the protections of expensing it will be more expensive for new businesses to open and for mature businesses to upgrade and expand operations resulting in fewer jobs and slower wage gains making expensing permanent is a crucial component of meeting the trump administration s target of 3 growth as the administration develops a formal proposal for tax cuts 2 0 reforms such as expensing and universal savings accounts are crucial components adam n michel senior policy analyst grover m hermann center for the federal budget a flat future for defense the trump defense budget request follows the cap set by the bipartisan budget act of 2019 at 740 5 billion it would be a 0 3 increase over last year s appropriated defense budget this is not enough to cover inflationary cost growth for the coming year let alone reach the 3 to 5 annual real growth that defense secretary mark esper stated was necessary to meet the challenges of the national defense strategy just last thursday the budget describes some cuts that were made by the defense department as it sought to find savings in accounts such as health care or defense logistics this effort freed 5 billion that had been reinvested in higher priority items such as our nuclear deterrent and cutting edge technology research hopefully congress will support those changes related us shouldn t rejoin un tourism agency despite trump s budget request the budget also describes essentially a flat trajectory for defense spending in future years in marked contrast to what was deemed as necessary by multiple secretaries of defense and by the bipartisan commission on the national defense strategy in the budget document defense raises at inflationary levels from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2025 and then is literally flat until fiscal 2030 a clear disconnect exists between what senior pentagon leaders have expressed as necessary and what the white house has outlined a flat budget for the defense department would mean that every year the department will have to find around 14 billion of savings in order to maintain its purchasing power even in the context of a 740 billion budget it is going to be a tall task frederico bartels policy analyst for defense budgeting center for national defense optimistic but not impossible economic projections fast economic growth and low interest rates are key assumptions that would help the president s budget proposal balance in 15 years these projections are certainly optimistic but not inconceivable in an aggressively pro growth policy environment the assumed average growth rate of 3 is not comparable to other projections such as the recently released congressional budget office economic forecast of a 1 7 annual growth rate cbo assumes that things stay on their current trajectory taxes increase in 2025 deregulation efforts stop and federal programs keep growing out of control the president s budget assumes many of the opposite policies and thus can count on better economic conditions the assumed growth rates are certainly close to the upper bound of pro growth optimism but also represent a simple return to historical trends sustained high growth does not follow automatically from enacting the president s agenda many other things outside the control of washington also must go right economic growth of 3 would be easier to achieve if the budget also included a concrete path to reduce tariffs quiet trade uncertainty and extend the business expensing tax reforms set to expire at the end of fiscal 2022 adam n michel senior policy analyst hermann center for the federal budget government shouldn t run paid family leave the president s budget calls for more government intervention in paid family leave extending paid parental leave benefits to all new parents the mechanism appears to be small grants to states to help them set up programs that work best for their workforce and economy but state level politicians and bureaucrats still are not better equipped than business owners and workers to know what works best for them it turns out that employees value flexible work schedules by a margin of 6 to 1 over more paid parental leave including other means of granting more flexibility to workers such as through telecommuting increases the ratio to 11 to 1 although paid parental and paid family leave are valuable they are not without cost and consequence some of those costs and consequences are playing out with existing state based programs of paid family leave both california s and new jersey s programs increased the unemployment rate and the duration of unemployment for young women and in california the program resulted in 7 lower employment and 8 lower annual earnings for mothers as well as reduced fertility rates these programs also are regressive taxing everyone but primarily benefiting middle and upper income earners in california workers in the highest income bracket file more than five times as many paid family leave claims as those in the lowest income bracket and although the taxes may start out low they already have grown and will continue to grow over time economists estimate that a national paid family leave program would cost the average worker an extra 1 500 to 2 900 per year in additional taxes with tremendous growth in the number of new and expanded employer provided policies now is not the time to sideswipe more flexible and accommodating policies with one size fits all rigid and bureaucratic government programs most workers and families would prefer to be able to choose how to spend their money in ways that meet their particular needs than to have it taken from them and be told what types of government programs they are eligible to receive it turns out that although paid parental leave is important to employees there are better ways to help them balance work family and health needs the working families flexibility act would give lower wage workers the option to accumulate paid time off universal savings accounts would help families save for all kinds of life events and fewer regulations would free up business resources to help employers provide paid family leave none of these would subject workers and their families to the mercy of government programs and bureaucrats to meet their needs rachel greszler research fellow in economics budget and entitlements hermann center for the federal budget education spending smartly trimmed tax credit scholarship remains pitfall the trump administration has requested 66 6 billion for the department of education which would be a 7 8 or 5 6 billion reduction from the 72 2 billion enacted for fiscal 2020 although the proposed reductions are slightly lower than those proposed last year the top line for the agency goes in the right direction and overall the budget would save 124 billion over 10 years through reductions in mandatory program spending at the department moving in the right direction in the k 12 space the budget would establish the elementary and secondary education for the disadvantaged block grant consolidating 29 existing programs into a single 19 4 billion formula funded block grant the budget includes few details about the proposed block grant but the funds would be distributed through the existing title i formula states and school districts then could decide how best to use funds this approach appears to mirror that of the academic partnerships lead us to success aplus act a longstanding goal of conservatives the aplus proposal introduced by rep mark walker r n c and sen steve daines r mont would allow states to opt out of the existing labyrinthine structure of elementary and secondary education act programs and put their federal k 12 dollars toward any lawful education purpose under state law the budget wisely calls for elimination of subsidized student loans saving 18 billion from 2021 to 2030 along with the elimination of obama era public service loan forgiveness saving 52 billion from 2021 to 2030 it also would cap the graduate plus loan program saving 27 5 billion over 10 years as well as the parent plus loan program the administration wisely would eliminate public service loan forgiveness which passes the tab for public employees student loans onto taxpayers after 10 years but is also would reduce from 20 years to 15 years the length of repayment for undergraduate students under the proposed income driven repayment plan a step in the wrong direction profligate federal spending through subsidized student loans has fueled tuition inflation driving up college costs and burdening families student loan forgiveness policies have exposed taxpayers to 1 6 trillion in outstanding student loan debt this budget recognizes those realities and makes some important course corrections in the right direction but it should go further in ensuring that no taxpayer should have to pay for someone else s loan that they didn t agree to take out policy shortfalls although there is much to celebrate in the president s budget request one major misstep is the proposed 5 billion education freedom scholarships program which would cost 45 billion from 2021 through 2030 this new program would leverage the federal tax code to create a scholarship program for eligible students to attend a private school of choice as my colleague adam michel and i recently wrote the administration s support of school choice is praiseworthy but a federal tax credit scholarship program poses a threat to education choice in the states and undermines the goal of a streamlined federal tax code moreover the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to create such a program which would establish massive new federal spending and would likely subject private schools to future regulations from an administration and congress less friendly to education choice the budget also includes significant new spending in another area reserved to the states vocational education although career and technical education is an important tool for climbing the ladder of upward economic mobility and pursuing careers in the trades it is the job of local high schools to provide for vocational classes not the federal government yet the proposed budget would increase spending by nearly 1 billion on career and technical education to help ensure that every high school has a high quality vocational program this is despite the fact that 98 of public school districts already offer career and technical education to high schools students finally over at the department of health and human services funding for the failed head start program is maintained and the budget proposes a new 1 billion investment for states to build the supply of care and stimulate employer investment is child care it is long past time for congress and the administration to restore revenue responsibility for head start to the states lindsey m burke director center for education policy and will skillman fellow in education policy a critical reform to school meals the budget proposal would fix an egregious and likely unauthorized expansion of school meals to middle class and wealthy families nearly a century ago federal lawmakers created the national school lunch program to help children in need who couldn t afford to buy food at school yet in 2010 congress expanded eligibility for school meals through the community eligibility provision allowing some schools and districts to provide free meals to students from middle class and wealthy families as if this weren t bad enough the department of agriculture then improperly interpreted the provision to allow even more schools to provide free meals to children who are not in need the community eligibility provision allows schools or districts to offer free meals to all students if 40 or more of the students in the school or district are eligible for means tested welfare programs such as food stamps the agriculture department has gone beyond the scope of the law and is allowing districts to group schools together in order to meet this 40 threshold as a result a district could group a school that doesn t enroll a single student from a low income family with another school that does have a high percentage of children living in poverty if together these two schools meet the 40 threshold the school without a single low income student can provide free meals to all of its students the budget proposal clarifies that districts cannot group schools together in this way each school would have to meet the 40 figure to participate in the community eligibility provision if this change is made children in need would still be able to access free and reduced priced meals but the federal government will begin the process of returning these school meals to the original purpose helping children from low income families jonathan butcher senior policy analyst center for education policy and daren bakst senior research fellow in agricultural policy thomas a roe institute for economic policy studies protecting private union pensions without taxpayer dollars the president s budget once again calls for protecting workers with multiemployer or union pensions by keeping the government entity that provides pension insurance the pension benefit guaranty corporation solvent for at least the next 20 years the pbgc s multiemployer program it expected to run out of funds to pay insured benefits in just five years at which point workers could receive mere pennies on the dollar in promised benefits at stake is a massive 638 billion shortfall between what private sector employers and unions promised to their workers and what they actually set aside to pay them of the roughly 11 million workers with multiemployer pensions more than 75 are in plans that are less than 50 funded the pension benefit guaranty corporation provides a backstop to pension losses but its revenues are nowhere near sufficient to provided needed benefits the president s fiscal 2021 budget calls for an additional 26 billion in the pbgc s multiemployer program premiums including adding a risk based component to discourage plans from overpromising and underfunding notably this is an 8 billion increase from last year s proposed 18 billion increase to accomplish the same goal of keeping the pbgc solvent for another 20 years that increase came despite congress s unprecedented bailout for the united mine workers of america s 6 billion in broken pension promises a large portion of which otherwise would have been the pbgc s liability this dramatic one year increase emphasizes the high price of failing to enact commonsense multiemployer pension reforms the longer congress waits the higher the risks of another taxpayer bailout become rachel greszler research fellow in economics budget and entitlements hermann center for the federal budget reforming agricultural subsidies once again the trump administration should be commended for trying to bring commonsense reform to agricultural subsidies the budget request explains the budget proposes to maintain a strong safety net for farmers while achieving savings by eliminating subsidies to higher income farmers reducing overly generous crop insurance subsidies to producers and companies and eliminating some programs that have no federal purpose or are duplicative proposed reforms include limiting the crop insurance premium subsidy for farmers to a reasonable and more defensible number currently taxpayers pay on average 62 of the federal crop insurance premiums for farmers the budget would maintain a very generous subsidy but reduce it so that taxpayers would on average pay 48 of premiums congress should embrace this widely supported bipartisan reform the government accountability office has recommended this reform and the congressional budget office listed reducing premium subsidies as one of its options to reduce the deficit the cbo option would be more ambitious lowering the subsidy to 40 this change would save about 21 billion over 10 years limiting specific subsidies to agricultural producers with an adjusted gross income of less than 500 000 this change still would allow subsidies to go to producers who are doing very well financially as measured by adjusted gross income but would bring some limits to the federal government s generosity with taxpayers money as explained in the budget the budget proposes to eliminate premium subsidies commodity payments and conservation program eligibility for farmers with agis over 500 000 it is hard to justify to taxpayers why the government should provide assistance to farmers with incomes over half a million dollars doing so undermines the credibility and purpose of farm programs in 2013 a year of record high farm income only 2 1 of farmers had agis in excess of this amount additional reforms in the budget proposal include tightening payments limits eliminating loopholes and ending excessive assistance to crop insurance companies daren bakst senior research fellow in agricultural policy roe institute for economic policy studies preserving the health care safety net the president s budget highlights the need to preserve and protect the health are safety net for those who need it the medicaid program which serves the most vulnerable in our society is overstretched and overburdened right now 1 in 5 americans use medicaid and federal and state spending on the program is nearing a trillion dollars this creates significant pressure on federal and state budgets squeezes other important priorities and leaves those on the program at risk the budget builds upon current administrative actions and lays out additional reforms for the medicaid program specifically it highlights new efforts to provide states with additional flexibility to care for those with mental illness recommends new measures to ensure only those eligible for the program are enrolled and extends welfare work requirements to the medicaid program to continue to help americans move up and out of poverty these policies are headed in the right direction the budget recognizes the importance of instituting changes that will improve the management and oversight of the program it also recognizes through its broader health reform vision that more should be done to meet the needs of those who need it most nina owcharenko schaefer senior research fellow health policy center reducing the cost of prescription drugs the president s budget rightly calls on congress to address high prescription drug costs government policy contributed to this problem through flawed regulations and subsidies that drive up costs the budget would address these flawed policies by supporting bipartisan congressional reforms to the successful medicare prescription drug benefit the heritage foundation has outlined a road map with details of such reforms which would provide relief for patients and taxpayers at the same time policymakers must reject heavy handed solutions such as those proposed by house speaker nancy pelosi because they would limit access to lifesaving medicines and impede access to new cures lawmakers should focus on addressing the underlying problems in public programs rather than layering on additional administrative and regulatory schemes such as international reference pricing edmund f haislmaier preston a wells jr senior research fellow in domestic policy studies strengthening the medicare program the president s budget will strengthen medicare by providing for a more rational payment system improving choices and care options for america s seniors and combating the waste fraud and abuse that has historically plagued the program trump is proposing to change the way medicare pays for medical benefits services and procedures currently medicare reimburses medical services performed at hospitals at a higher rate than the rate paid to physicians or clinics providing medical services outside of the hospital setting under the president s proposal the medicare payment for several procedures or services would be the same regardless of the setting of the care delivery long championed by the heritage foundation this change to the site neutrality payment system not only would reduce excessive costs but also create a level playing field between hospitals and other care delivery systems this would strengthen competition and increase physician independence while expanding choices and lowering costs for medicare patients from 2021 to 2030 these site neutrality proposals for post acute care hospice care and care in physician offices are projected to save an estimated total of 270 3 billion with these and other medicare payment adjustments the administration estimates that the total set of medicare changes would extend the life of the medicare hospitalization trust fund for the next 25 years under current law the medicare hospitalization trust fund faces insolvency in 2026 the president s budget also includes several proposals to expand the choices of medicare patients the proposed budget would allow medicare beneficiaries with high deductible health plans the right to make tax free contributions to health savings accounts and medical savings accounts in accord with another longstanding heritage foundation policy recommendation the president s budget also would allow medicare beneficiaries the right to choose a comprehensive private health plan if they wish to do so instead of enrolling in the medicare hospitalization program part a without losing their social security benefits moreover in an effort to strengthen cancer screening trump s budget would end coinsurance requirements for medicare patients who undergo colonoscopies with polyp removal the president s budget also includes initiatives that he offered last year including significant reforms of graduate medical education and uncompensated hospital care payments to beef up the administration s continuing campaign to combat waste fraud and abuse in the medicare program the budget would provide an additional 13 7 billion to that effort over 10 years robert e moffit senior fellow health policy center shrinking energy cronyism unleashing energy abundance similar to the trump administration s previous budgets the proposal for fiscal 2021 would shrink the federal government s unnecessary meddling in energy markets the president s budget also proposes to repeal special tax credits for renewable energy technologies which eliminate a major source of government favoritism in energy markets and relieve taxpayers of a 16 billion burden over 10 years the budget also would eliminate energy loan programs in particular the title xvii loan guarantees for advanced technologies and the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing loans these programs put taxpayers money at risk leading to notorious bankruptcies such as solyndra and the current underwriting of the multibillion dollar vogtle nuclear reactors in georgia these programs distort risk and private sector investments not to mention that the government shouldn t be an investor in energy projects anyway the budget also would reduce spending in applied research and development energy programs whether it s basic or applied taxpayers shouldn t foot the bill for activities best left to innovators and private investors in contrast to some calls to nationalize more of the energy sector the president s proposal would sell off transmission assets of the power marketing administrations four quasi federal electric utilities serving the south and west it also would reduce their access to taxpayer subsidized borrowing authority and require them to sell power at market rates these are good stepping stones to privatizing these assets something the reagan and clinton administrations both recommended and was done successfully under bill clinton with the alaska power administration importantly the trump administration would continue to right size burdensome regulations that have tied up energy development in years of red tape as the president s budget emphasizes energy companies across the world are ready to build in our nation and permitting reform that cuts red tape shows that we welcome their investments my administration continues to support growth in the energy sector by removing unnecessary regulations and unleashing america s vast natural and human resources the administration s commitment to open access to america s wealth of energy on federal lands is a welcome reversal from the previous administration s keep it in the ground mentality katie tubb senior policy analyst for energy and environmental issues roe institute for economic policy studies and nicolas loris deputy director roe institute for economic policy studies and herbert and joyce morgan research fellow yucca mountain complicated invitation to reopen debate up to now trump s budgets have requested just enough funds to finish the licensing review of a repository for nuclear waste at yucca mountain in tonopah nevada but for 10 years congress has failed to either to pass legislation or appropriate funds so the administration could follow the nuclear waste policy act which designates yucca mountain as a national repository this negligence has cost constituents 8 billion in lawsuits already exactly what the law was designed to prevent and is on track to cost tens of billions more in the years to come so the president s frustration is deeply merited unfortunately the administration s budget request does not include funds to finish the license review of a potential repository at yucca mountain instead it proposes 27 5 million to begin an interim storage and nuclear waste fund oversight program importantly the administration cannot strike out on its own to develop new policy the nuclear waste policy act is quite clear that the administration cannot pursue an interim storage program without progressing on a permanent waste repository the courts swatted down the previous administration s attempt to disregard the law unless and until congress changed it finishing the yucca mountain review is a relatively small step that would inform decisions no matter what long term nuclear waste disposal options ultimately are pursued it does not inescapably commit congress to building the repository without further appropriations something congress has been quite adept at withholding it also would let the voices of all nevadans be heard most of the state s congressional delegation opposes a yucca mountain repository but funding completion of the review and review only is consistent with their demands for a thorough process with state input and for further adjudicating concerns in a formal setting that the department of energy must address despite this noticeable absence the budget proposal also assumes the nuclear waste fee an arbitrary fee on nuclear power plants set by the department of energy will be reinstated in fiscal 2023 but this fee is one of the deep fundamental flaws plaguing nuclear waste management policy that need to be reformed trump is right to want to look for solutions and his budget provides an opportunity to reopen the conversation nuclear waste management policy and the roles of industry states and the federal government need to be reimagined the first step is finishing the review of yucca mountain ultimately a real solution comes from giving the nuclear industry responsibility and introducing market forces into waste management solutions katie tubb senior policy analyst for energy and environmental issues roe institute for economic policy studies wrong way on transportation the president s budget envisions a significant increase in federal spending on infrastructure proposing 1 trillion in funding over 10 years this is the wrong way to improve the nation s roads bridges and other valuable physical assets federal involvement makes infrastructure projects more expensive more time consuming and more vulnerable to political manipulation for example federal spending on mass transit far exceeds its actual use by americans when compared to highways however congressional democrats historically have demanded that transit receive a too generous amount of funding as a percent of overall transportation spending trump s budget does nothing to meaningfully change this politically driven calculation although the administration has made progress on regulatory reform such as the one federal decision rule and streamlining the national environmental policy act this does not change the fact that the federal government is a cumbersome and inefficient partner for infrastructure projects red tape such as the davis bacon act and project labor agreements drive up costs by forcing state government contractors to pay union wage rates and use union style work rules the process of submitting proposals for federal subsidies delays the start of projects that normally should be the sole responsibility of state and local governments just as important more federal activity would crowd out private infrastructure activity private financing avoids many wasteful federal regulations and reduces the burden on taxpayers it is vital to understand that there are only two ways to pay for spending increases more taxes or more debt the president s budget does not call for a gas tax increase or a new transportation revenue source which means that the infrastructure proposal reduces the amount of deficit reduction in the budget rather than increasing the federal infrastructure role congress and the administration should go the opposite direction a policy of reducing the federal gas tax lowering infrastructure spending and further eliminating red tape would enable more activity and value from state and local governments and the private sector enhancing america s prosperity david ditch research associate hermann center for the federal budget waste cut in higher education but new repayment options leave taxpayers on hook the president s budget takes meaningful steps in reducing or eliminating wasteful spending on higher education most notably changes to the federal student loan program such as eliminating public service loan forgiveness ending subsidized loans and placing caps on both the parent and graduate plus loan programs meaningfully insulate taxpayers from risky loans made by the department of education the president s budget also calls for consolidation of loan repayment plans into one income driven repayment plan although the overly complicated federal student loan repayment options are badly in need of simplification the budget proposes reducing the number of years a student must pay off their loans from 20 years to 15 years for undergraduate students the remaining balance after that time would be forgiven and absorbed by taxpayers this moves federal policy in the wrong direction instead the budget should prioritize insulating taxpayers from the financial risk for students who are unable to pay off loans however the budget s constraints on duplicative or ineffective higher education programs is praiseworthy the budget puts guardrails in place to reduce improper payments in the pell grant program additionally it calls for eliminating the redundant federal supplemental education opportunity grants as well as reducing funding for the federal trio and work study programs such programs have little evidence of success at significant cost to american taxpayers mary clare amselem policy analyst center for education policy defending free speech on campus the administration s budget proposal draws national attention to the repeated shout downs disinvitations and other forms of censorship on college campuses the proposal says that colleges that receive federal research grants must adhere to the requirements of the first amendment to the constitution a reminder for schools that allow students to shout down invited lecturers or chase the college president off a stage that such actions interfere with and may even violate individuals freedom to listen and be heard last year the president raised the profile of this issue with a broadly worded executive order similar to the language in the budget proposal the order said colleges that receive federal grants should promote free inquiry and enforce the first amendment although both the budget and the executive order appropriately emphasize that disruptive protests threaten expressive rights on campuses around the country washington should be careful with any additional actions the department of education should not enlarge the federal footprint in higher education by assuming new investigative responsibilities generally state policymakers and university governing boards are responsible for public university systems policymakers around the country are taking action to protect speech when college administrators fail to do so state officials in alabama arizona georgia north carolina and wisconsin have adopted provisions that reinforce the rights of anyone lawfully present on a public college campus the provisions are based on the idea that individuals and groups should be allowed to protest or demonstrate in publicly accessible areas such as on sidewalks or lawns furthermore public university leaders should be prepared to impose consequences on individuals including students who violate someone else s right to speak while closely adhering to due process protections for the accused such policies already are having their intended effect in wisconsin one group of protesters said the university s new policies prevented them from shouting down a speaker in 2017 the justice department should continue to defend free speech on campus through statements of interest in appropriate cases in 2018 after the group speech first filed a suit against the university of michigan over the school s so called bias response team the department issued a statement saying the university s policy chills protected speech the u s court of appeals for the 6th circuit issued a ruling with a similar statement and the school settled with speech first and revised its policies the white house should emphasize that public colleges must protect the first amendment but officials should beware of the potential for unintended consequences from federal administrative actions state policymakers should guard expressive rights on campus and direct public college governing boards to adopt proposals that do the same jonathan

by nicholas larsen international banker on the final monday of 2019 protesters staged a sit in at the beirut offices of bank audi lebanon s largest bank chants of we want the money were heard as the furious protesters many of them audi s clients demanded that tellers give them their funds but with stringent withdrawal limits imposed across much of the country s banking sector that are now confining customers to just a few hundred dollars per week lebanon s worst financial crisis since the days of its civil war has left much of the country strapped for cash several factors have led to lebanon s current quagmire but few have been more impactful than the country s rather bemusing monetary policy over the last decade during this time the central bank banque du liban liberally hiked its interest rate for depositors to fund the government s spiralling debt problem as well as to pay for its substantial volume of imports and to draw in dollars to help maintain the lebanese pound s 22 year old peg to the us currency as such the period following the financial crisis saw lebanon being one of the very few countries to offer investors highly attractive rates of return while much of the rest of the world slashed rates to stimulate economic recovery this made the small middle eastern nation a magnet for wealthy investors from around the world but relying on overseas dollars was a dangerous policy the central bank continued to pay higher and higher rates to attract funds into the country despite those dollars being insufficient to cover interest and capital payments according to the international monetary fund imf its us dollar reference lending rate rose from around 7 percent in early 2018 to 9 7 percent in june 2019 which in turn led to higher lebanese pound lending rates with economic conditions deteriorating poverty rising and interest rates continuing to rise the impact within lebanon was truly felt once the number of deposits at commercial banks started to decline precipitously in early 2018 with foreign deposits spectacularly crashing about a year later many have called the central bank s behaviour during this time as being akin to running a ponzi scheme banks incoming customer dollars were lent to the central bank at attractively high rates and in return they purchased government debt all the while making consistent profits on such transactions it is not surprising then that deposits placed with the central bank between 2017 and august 2019 swelled by a whopping 70 percent the dividends paid out by banks moreover went to shareholders of whom many were politicians and who were thus incentivised to continue with the scheme the government meanwhile kept amassing debt partly through often misguided spending measures such as expanded public hiring as a way to buy votes and ill conceived solutions for lebanon s ailing electricity sector by 2019 almost half of the government s fiscal revenues went to servicing external and domestic debt and most of the rest was used to pay public sector salaries indeed the debt has ballooned to such alarming levels that lebanon stands today as the world s third most indebted nation with a 152 percent debt to gdp ratio behind only japan and greece but the fuse inside the country was decisively lit on october 17 when lawmakers somewhat bizarrely attempted to rein in this widening fiscal deficit by imposing an unprecedented tax on the usage of the popular whatsapp messaging application protests then intensified when prime minister saad al hariri resigned a couple of weeks later hariri mysteriously disappeared for 10 days before emerging in saudi arabia to announce his departure which triggered much speculation and concern that he had been abducted by saudi officials as such the incident prompted many of the affluent lebanese to move their deposits out of the country concerns have also grown since then that the government is prioritising foreign creditors who together hold around 12 billion worth of lebanese debt at the expense of ordinary citizens who continue to face strict withdrawal limits indeed with banks across the country closing during the final quarter analysts suspect that such drastic measures have been taken due to the crippling dollar shortage which has prompted banks to minimise the risk of capital flight but by closing and then imposing withdrawal restrictions more panic has set in throughout the country and with protests growing more depositors have tried to withdraw their money to send abroad but the banks have placed such huge sums of deposits with the central bank that imposing stringent controls on dollar accounts has become their only option other than resorting to depleting the country s reserves depositors now fear that their savings could be at risk despite government assurances to the contrary with the banking sector identified as one of the chief culprits in causing the country s recent troubles commercial lenders have been on the receiving end of much of the ire which has only become worse since the capital controls came into effect with the cash shortage seemingly all but confirmed frustrations have grown to such an extent that rioting protesters have smashed up banks and automated teller machines while one protestor even took a bank employee hostage reports citing judicial sources confirm that dozens of lawsuits have also been filed by depositors against banks for withholding their money and with the sector having long enjoyed a cosy relationship with lebanon s political elite protesters have taken particular aim at the resulting corruption demanding the recovery of funds that were purportedly embezzled by politicians indeed many are demanding that the entire governing regime steps down lebanon s woes can also partly be attributed to external factors the civil war in neighbouring syria for instance has not helped matters with refugees streaming into the country significant pressure has been placed on public services such as water and electricity while tourism has also taken a nosedive and lower oil prices have only exacerbated the situation as the substantial number of remittances from lebanese expatriates in neighbouring oil rich countries has declined with the likes of saudi arabia having recently threatened to expel lebanese nationals the declining inflow of remittances has reduced the contribution towards lebanese banks efforts to fund additional debt while the remittance dollars that previously helped to support the pound s peg has significantly diminished indeed the lebanese pound is now under mounting pressure although the official peg is at 1 500 pounds the economic downturn has meant that foreign exchange dealers have been trading dollars at more than 2 600 pounds in recent weeks the imf also recently acknowledged that the pound is around 50 percent overvalued unsurprisingly comments by lebanon s central bank governor riad salameh that nobody knows how much more the cost of dollars traded on the black market will increase have not been received well while fears continue to grow over a potential devaluation of the pound that would seriously hurt the country s savers speaking to the financial times sibylle rizk the public policy director at lobby group kulluna irada noted that despite all of the dollars that have flowed into lebanon we have no infrastructure no productive sector we have nothing all this money was burnt on consumption through imports and real estate which is a bubble and to defend the peg hariri remains as caretaker leader in the interim and has resorted to asking the imf and the world bank for support amid growing concern over a possible default his successor prime minister designate hassan diab was named on december 19 although he is also accused by protesters of being part of the corrupt ruling elite diab is backed by militant group hezbollah which is an integral part of the lebanese government but is also designated as a terrorist organisation by the united states and has been recently on the receiving end of new sanctions that have only put further pressure on lebanese citizens the world bank wb believes that lebanon s economy contracted by 0 2 percent in 2019 and possibly by even more given the deteriorating environment of the final quarter balance of payments constraints are leading to dire conditions for businesses and workers declining confidence in the economy is also causing higher dollarization of deposits which impose a heavy toll on the balance sheets of banks and lebanon s central bank as such the world bank believes that the poverty level could rise to half from around a third by 2018 estimates should a worsening situation materialise unemployment especially among youth is already high and could further rise sharply the wb observed in november there are now growing calls for banks to service imports rather than debts with lebanese officials having asked for help from foreign countries and banks to secure capital for this purpose we will ask the international donors to provide lebanon with 4 billion to 5 billion in soft loans to finance the purchasing of wheat fuel oil and pharmaceuticals ghazi wazni the newly appointed finance minister told a local newspaper this injection will cover the country s needs for one year and will also help reduce the run on the us dollar but donors are demanding that lebanon implement reforms and tackle systemic corruption before they agree to provide support to date the central bank is managing to fulfil its repayment obligations to domestic banks although lebanon s sovereign debt has been downgraded several times and investors are increasingly concerned that it could default on its next bond payment in march ratings agency fitch recently predicted that lebanon will default on 88 billion of public borrowing while s p global ratings downgraded the long term issuer credit ratings for three of lebanon s biggest banks to selective default from ccc and with the private sector continuing to default on loans some believe that lebanon s banking sector now has a higher rate of bad debt on its books than the united states did in 2008 as talk of collapse continues to grow lebanon remains on course to face arguably the most challenging financial moment in its history
france bowed to west african pressure in december finally agreeing to loosen supervision of the financial community of africa currency union and cfa franc the new currency will be the eco poised to launch this year supervised under the auspices of the economic community of west african states or ecowas but the lack of convergence in debt and inflation rates among the members renders the entire eco project premature risky and fatally flawed from its very conception the reality is that the differences among ecowas economies are large and the type of institutional arrangements that would allow disparate economic entities to share a common currency is lacking the eco could benefit by studying lessons from the euro established two decades ago after six years of planning followed by three years of full currency integration before euro cash hit the streets still the eco project might have a fighting chance given that eight ecowas members already have 75 years experience with a single currency under the cfa franc the cfa franc is a common currency used by two african monetary zones the western zone comprising of eight countries and the central zone with six mostly petro states the currency was established after world war ii to help france import goods from its colonies initially pegged to the french franc and later the euro and many regard the currency as a relic of french colonial hold over the region the former french colonies had to store 50 percent of their foreign currency reserves in france in return for guarantees by the larger economy a french representative also had to be on the board of the currency s union these conditions were not as onerous as some might suggest euro pegging and french guarantee of the currency provided economic and financial stability especially during times of severe political stress such as the arab spring protests the 2008 global debt crisis and two civil wars in ivory coast 2002 2007 and 2010 2011 further although the french treasury held the reserves at a lower interest rate than france s own inflation rate about 0 5 versus 1 5 prevailing market rate this was a reasonable premium to pay for such guarantees click to enlarge most of these conditions will end although the currency will remain pegged to the euro and guaranteed by france the goal is that a stable eco will help the region achieve objectives of the newly signed africa continental free trade area agreement seeking the creation of a single continental market for goods and services the expectation is that close integration will lead to faster economic growth based on the classical economic ideas as proposed by adam smith and david ricardo that larger markets lead to increased standards of living a result of increased economies of scale and comparative advantage consequently this would help develop industries and bolster investment to increase intraregional trade further potential benefits of currency unions like the eco are summarized by robert mundell a nobel laureate in economics in his 1961 text a theory of optimum currency areas if a single currency is used there would be a common inflation rate and similar interest rate a considerable growth in trade productivity and finance integration all of which would generate a considerable increase in economic growth and well being a successful eco would create an attractive economic bloc for foreign investors and have positive implications for growth in the region related how the ultra wealthy are using art to dodge taxes for a currency union to succeed mundell proposed a convergence criterion as precondition for participating countries part of this was adopted by the 1992 maastricht treaty that established the euro and included requiring those joining the eurozone to restrict their deficits to less than 3 percent of gdp and debts to less than 60 percent of gdp similarly to join the ecozone union members have agreed to meet economic convergence criteria that include keeping public debt below 70 percent of gdp fiscal deficit below 3 percent of gdp a stable exchange rate and single digit inflation among others yet according to the latest ecowas macroeconomic convergence report in 2019 not a single member met all criteria inflation in sierra leone averaged 16 9 percent in 2018 and general government debt in cabo verde surged to 121 percent of gdp according to estimates by the international monetary fund such challenges make the 2020 proposed deadline highly untenable and members should study the euro and keep three lessons in mind the first lesson from the euro is that the creation of a single currency required responsible institutions that enabled a region of europe s diversity to function properly flawed at birth the euro s proponents did not take into account the diversity of the continent nor did they build mechanisms that would withstand shocks wrote joseph stiglitz another nobel laureate in the euro how a common currency threatens the future of europe click to enlarge click to enlarge africa shares this challenge for instance the guinean economy has a gdp of approximately 7 billion less than nigeria s 13th largest state abia with 8 7 billion such disparities are reminiscent of the differences in the eurozone that tested the euro s strength especially during the 2008 crisis strong economies such as germany could withstand the shock while weaker ones like greece suffered the common currency deprived states off their individual ability to adjust respective monetary policies as need arose to stimulate an economy a central bank reduces interest rates to make credit more accessible leading to a lower exchange rate thereby making exports more competitive and discouraging imports these trends improve a country s trade balance sheet and strengthen the economy given that different countries confront various economic challenges the common peg made it difficult for individual countries like greece to adjust monetary policy as inflation emerged this underlying rigidity in the euro ended up crippling the weaker economies related the american dream is turning into a nightmare for millennials a second reason for the euro s woes was that there was a lack of economic and fiscal policy discipline among some eurozone companies this was accompanied by dysfunctional sanctioning mechanisms and weak financial regulation that led to the increased public and private debt levels and a loss of competitiveness countries with more social programs and debt expected frugal nations to provide rescue creating moral hazard eco countries must therefore stick to their convergence criteria commitments to avoid the same failure by one state threatens the cohesion of the entire ecowas zone since a country s fiscal deficits could have systemic region wide risks and inflationary pressure imposing huge externalities on others lastly and perhaps the most important lesson from the euro was that the economics of the currency were intimately intertwined with the politics of the eurozone stiglitz states that political disagreement among the eurozone states would have made it difficult to create the economic arrangements that enabled the common currency to work stiglitz points to the political cooperation among the 50 states in america as part of the reason why the us dollar project was more successfully implemented than the euro as such members of ecowas need to reach a common consensus on a political level short of which will render all the aforementioned recommendations

tanmia capital director samer srouji considers whether gcc currencies should maintain their fixed exchange rate with the us dollar in the post oil era for more than three decades gcc economies have benefited from having their currencies anchored to the us dollar in that time the us dollar peg has served the region well providing monetary stability for investors traders and businesses alike but structural changes in the economies of the region including the re alignment of trade and investment ties towards asia make it reasonable to consider reform proposals gcc central bank governors attending the 72nd meeting of the gcc committee of governors of monetary institutions and central banks in muscat in march 2019 were clear about the challenges faced in the new oil era sparked by the oil price downturn in 2015 that year the region registered its largest fiscal deficit as governments imposed the first spending cuts in 20 years giving a new impetus to efforts to prepare for the post oil era while gcc states were able to defend the us dollar peg through their robust level of foreign reserves volatile oil prices and shifting trade patterns raise questions about the costs versus the benefits for the region of maintaining the us dollar anchor and whether this regime continues to be well suited to the needs of economies implementing an economic diversification agenda time for change being tied to us monetary policy has deprived policymakers of an essential tool to take countercyclical measures ie dampen inflation and prevent excess investment and trade surpluses when oil prices are high and the opposite when oil is low and may harm non oil sector competitiveness in the long term in monetary policy the choice of currency anchor should reflect trading relationships as well as the currency composition of public debt since gcc debt levels are generally low it is the structure of trade relationships that counts in its 2008 study why do countries peg the way they peg the determinants of anchor currency choice the imf stated that it is optimal for a country to adopt the anchor currency that minimises the sum of bilateral exchange rate volatilities weighted by the importance of each trade partner rise of asia the re alignment of gcc trade patterns particularly towards asia needs to be considered when weighing the benefits and costs of the current regime more than two thirds of saudi and uae imports were sourced from europe and asia in 2016 asia supplied 39 per cent of saudi imports a 10 per cent increase since 2000 and accounted for 40 per cent of the uae s imports north america meanwhile accounted for 15 per cent of saudi imports and 12 per cent of the uae s similarly more than half of exports for both economies were directed to europe and asia while north america barely registers as an export market at 3 and 4 per cent respectively as for energy exports 68 per cent of saudi arabia s oil exports went to east and south asia and the asia pacific region while for the uae 99 per cent went to those regions by comparison the americas accounted for 16 per cent of saudi oil exports and only 0 8 per cent of the uae s while this asian dominance of gcc energy exports may seem surprising asian countries have much fewer regional oil supplies to draw from this is in contrast to europe which sources a large part of its energy needs from russia norway and north africa while the us imports close to 45 perc ent of its oil from neighbouring canada in addition to producing for its own needs inflation risk while it can be argued that oil exports are denominated in us dollar and the dollar remains essential in any gcc exchange rate regime trade flow analysis suggests that the yuan and the euro should not be ignored one of the consequences of not including them becomes clear when one considers inflation when exchange rates are prevented from adjusting in the face of unexpected capital inflows or outflows adjustment can only take place through prices in the case of the gcc a sudden spike in the price of oil and resulting capital inflows can lead to significant increases in inflation while a drop can lead to deficits and capital outflows high inflation or deflation are never good for an economy and are why nearly all major commodity exporters canada new zealand and norway allow some fluctuations in their exchange rates and practice inflation targeting using interest rates norway for example implements a crawling band against the us dollar to manage oil price fluctuations in the run up to 2008 as oil prices peaked gcc states struggled to contain inflation which reached 12 3 per cent in the uae and 9 9 per cent in saudi arabia the chart below shows how closely inflation in the region follows oil prices inflation is only one outcome of being pegged to the dollar in the boom phase of capital inflows increased government and private spending financial and real estate bubbles and higher levels of imports which also feed inflation are other consequences having some exchange rate flexibility during the boom phase can help absorb inflation while raising interest rates can discourage excess spending and asset bubbles interest rates the problem with the peg is that gcc states are unable to utilise interest rates to manage the domestic economic cycle a particularly fatal combination was in the years leading to 2008 when low us interest rates coincided with high oil prices leaving policymakers with their hands tied similarly following the 2015 oil downturn gcc states would have benefited from continued low interest rates to boost economic activity yet us interest rates were on an upwards trend until late 2018 in may 2007 kuwait reintroduced a basket peg of the dollar the euro and possibly the yuan the official composition of the basket is undisclosed and regained control over its interest rate tying its currency to that of its main trade partners in europe and asia has allowed for better management of inflation as the exchange rate adapts to movements in the three major currencies the following chart shows the smooth progression of monthly inflation in kuwait from 2015 to 2019 against a composite index of oil prices and the yuan dollar exchange rate compared to more sporadic movements in saudi arabia and the uae where prices react more directly to movements in oil and the yuan kuwait saudi arabia and uae monthly inflation against index of oil and yuan dollar exchange rate 2015 2019composite index of oil price and yuan dollar exchange rate left axis and consumer price index right axis to understand this in practice when the yuan strengthens against the dollar imports from china become more expensive in aed and sr terms as the uae and saudi are pegged to the dollar resulting in imported inflation these are described as pass through effects in economics economist nasser saidi a member of the imf s middle east regional advisory group argued in 2018 that the dollar anchor was no longer appropriate for maintaining macroeconomic stability and suggested the adoption of a basket peg composed of the dollar the euro and yuan adjusted over time to reflect changes in trade gdp and financial ties anchoring to these three major currencies provides an equal level of credibility as being pegged to the dollar while enabling the economies to better navigate the imported inflation problem crucially a basket regime would also enable gcc central banks to exert better control over interest rates and the domestic economic cycle alternative approach another approach developed by harvard economist jeffrey frankel would be to include the weighted average price of oil in the basket peg alongside the three currencies what he calls a commodity plus currency basket while this approach is interesting allowing domestic currencies to quickly adapt to oil price movements it is untested and may prove too unstable for gcc currencies abandoning such a long standing element of monetary policy should not be done in haste reforming the exchange rate regime in favour of a three currency peg for example would require gcc states to implement important policy reforms this includes establishing a stronger inflation forecasting capacity as well as enhancing tools to intervene in money markets none of these reforms are beyond the capabilities of the gcc states and given the realignments that are taking place in the global economy would also serve to boost the non oil sectors they are seeking to develop about the author samer srouji is a director at tanmia

published monday 10 february 2020 print disqus richard rick mills ahead of the herd the trump administration has just granted its commerce department sweeping powers to slap tariffs on countries it decides are manipulating their currencies to the detriment of the united states and its exporting companies for some this will come as news at aoth it is confirmation that our earlier warning reported here has come true in our article us prepares for currency war we warned readers about these new powers when they were first proposed by the us government several months ago amid its trade war with china the commerce department now says it will proceed with the plan which gives commerce a wide scope of power to decide whether or not a country is under cutting us exporters by keeping its currency artificially low whereas commerce normally follows the advice of the treasury department which issues a twice yearly report to congress on suspected currency manipulators on whether to impose trade sanctions the new rules allow commerce to slap duties on goods from accused countries and individual businesses even in cases where the treasury did not find them to be guilty of currency manipulation bloomberg neatly explains what broadening the commerce department s mandate to impose anti subsidy duties could mean the new rule which was opposed by the treasury department when it was first proposed in may 2019 would allow u s companies to file complaints with the commerce department over specific imported products by treating undervalued currencies as a form of unfair subsidy it would also give the administration the power to self initiate cases should it so choose however potentially making the u s government plaintiff judge jury and executioner in currency fights some industries and us at aoth believe this aggressively protectionist stance will lead to currency wars and turn the 6 trillion per day global currency market into a new battleground for trump s trade wars goods benefiting from weak currencies representing each and every one of america s trading partners could be recipients of duties or countervailing duties equal to the difference between the weaker currency and the us dollar in other words eliminating that country s currency advantage here s how it could work a us company that manufactures and sells widgets is losing market share to chinese companies that makes their widgets cheaper and sells them in the us at a significant discount to us widgets the us companies through an industry association lobby the us government to help them stop china from dumping widgets on the us market the industry association says that china s undervalued currency is an unfair subsidy the commerce department investigates president trump imposes a tariff on chinese widgets to level the playing field for american widget makers trump s claim that his tariffs on chinese goods are being absorbed by the chinese government is incorrect in this situation the us consumer pays the inflated price the tariff on a chinese widget and the tariff percentage goes to the us government the real loser is the us consumer or end user who is forced to buy more expensive american widgets while china is the obvious target of us tariffs and rule changes strengthening the commerce department s hand in dealing with currency complaints there are many other countries and individual businesses commerce has in its sights last year the treasury department came out with a report that recommended 21 trading partners should face scrutiny over their currencies they include china germany japan south korea ireland italy malaysia vietnam and singapore these trading nations and even their indivivual businesses that import goods into the us are now vulnerable to being tariffed on targeted imports an amount that will make imports sell for more than their us counterpart the big question is why the official reason given by secretary of commerce wilbur ross is as follows this currency rule is an important step in ensuring that unfair trade practices are properly remedied ross said in a statement while successive administrations have balked at countervailing foreign currency subsidies the trump administration is taking action to level the playing field for american businesses and workers weaponizing the dollar but the most important reason for such drastic protectionism not seen in the united states since the great depression is to lower the us dollar previous attempts by trump to talk down the dollar through pressing fed chair jerome powell to lower interest rates and demonizing him for not doing so have largely failed the us dollar index dxy has not dropped below 95 in the past year many trade and forex observers believe the currency rule is another step in trump s efforts to weaponize the dollar for trump a low dollar is the way to bring jobs back to the us after so many were exported abroad to take advantage of lower labor costs and therefore rebuild the us manufacturing sector primarily through cheaper exports the problem for the united states is that throughout the past several years the dollar has remained high in relation to other currencies the dollar as the world s reserve currency can only go so low because it will always be in high demand for countries to purchase commodities priced in us dollars and us treasuries nor should it be allowed to go too low because that would risk the dollar losing its exorbitant privilege us exporters face resistance from foreign buyers because products priced in dollars are more expensive bloomberg quotes mark sobel a former treasury official this is a unilateral policy which will alienate countries around the world he added the highly unusual trading stance may even put the us at odds with its world trade organization commitments opening the country up to wto challenges conclusion but there s more to it than that taken to its logical solution if the us starts slapping tariffs on all the products its domestic industries can t compete against we are looking at the complete collapse of global trade as we know it imagine you want to hell you need to sell your products to the us because of the enormity of the us market consumer spending makes up 70 of us gdp to be a successful international company you need to be selling into the us but your american competitors don t like how cheaply you re able to sell your goods in their own backyard they complain to the commerce department and bang you re your us imports are immediately hit with a 25 tariff guess what just happened to your us market any country in the world that manufactures goods that are priced higher than ones made in the us or any country company that manufactures goods the commerce department thinks can be made cheaper domestically can be subjected to punishing duties those duties aren t picked up by the so called currency manipulators they are added to the prices paid by us consumers and go directly into us government coffers and because a lot of goods previously made in america no longer are because of globalization american consumers end up paying billions of dollars worth of duties which are effectively an import tax on consumers having treated its former trading partners with such disdain they of course begin looking elsewhere to replace the increasingly closed off us market in country supply chains spring up regional trading blocks with countries friendly enough to not engage in a race to the bottom devaluation battle start to emerge including the countries that are part of china s belt and road initiative the problem though is everything is priced in us dollars companies don t have to sell into the us but they do have to buy raw materials which invariably are priced in usd soon discussions at higher levels like the imf and the wto point to alternatives beyond the usd the us has been in danger of losing its exorbitant privilege but now its adversarial trade stance pushes the major powers into adopting a new global currency possibly backed by gold once this happens the us dollar plunges in value hardly anyone can afford to trade with the us because of its radical protectionism in this environment of fear and isolationism the metals that prosper are gold and silver traditional safe havens that hold their value and can be relied upon as tangible currencies in the event of a fiat money breakdown the united states withdraws further and further from its former trading partners eventually the only countries it trades with are its old nafta stalwarts canada and mexico coffee beans from kenya chinese silks forget about it most imported products are either too expensive or not available the irony in all this is how badly the us would hurt itself bereft of trading partners the once mighty us economy becomes a shadow of its former self as for commodities the new america is in real trouble having relied on offshore suppliers for decades the us mining industry cannot produce enough critical metals to feed the industries factories needed to replace imports raw materials are in short supply to fix america s crumbling infrastructure the us mining industry embraces the opportunity to explore for and mine these metals but it takes 10 to 15 years to build new mines and that s after large deposit discoveries are made it doesn t help that for many years the united states government couldn t agree on a viable mining strategy with anti mining democrats pitted against nimby republican lawmakers who preferred to share mining knowledge with countries locked into chinese off take agreements rather than nurture a domestic mining industry that could come to the rescue of the us which has cut itself adrift are we being alarmist maybe at aoth we believe the global economy has reached an inflection point that is very close to breaking down global growth has slowed compounded by trade wars the slowdown in china and the latest threat the novel coronavirus according to the world gold council global gold backed etfs and similar products added 61 tonnes t or net inflows of us 3 1bn in january across nearly all regions boosting holdings to new all time highs of 2 947t central banks worried about economies cooling and low inflation were buying gold by the truckload and pursuing monetary stimulus in the form of interest rate cuts and or massive bond buying programs like we went through with quantitative easing in the us europe and japan that worked pretty well after the financial crisis when the world economy was more or less back on track with no tit for tat tariffs impeding international trade and the us dollar still carrying enough heft and respect to enjoy exorbitant privilege this time is different we have an unpredictable president in the white house that has already done much damage to the world economy hurt the relationship between the us and china and now appears heading towards a global currency trade war wherein everybody dukes it out over who can devalue and out export the other the outcome is a gradual race to worthless and america s trading partners punting the dollar and replacing it with a basket of currencies likely remember all that central bank gold buying backed by gold the trump administration is going down a very dangerous road with its new currency rule that imbues the us commerce department with incredibly strong powers to invoke across the board trade protectionism from countries all the way down to individual companies the way we see it buying gold or silver bullion is one

the two year trade war between the u s and china upended commerce world wide slamming the brakes on global trade growth but also delivering modest benefits to a handful of industries and countries that saw gains as the giants tussled growth in global trade sank to a meager 1 last year down from 4 in 2018 and 6 in 2017 it was the fourth worst showing in 40 years and the worst ever outside a period of recession according to international monetary fund data several factors contributed to the slowdown but analysts say the u s china trade war was the single biggest cause the u s and china are the world s great buying engines each pulling in over 2 trillion a year of goods trade between the two nations slowed as a result of tariffs and other measures and the decline couldn t be entirely made up by purchases from other countries behind the slump were falling u s sales to china of agriculture products aircraft and machinery while china s sales of electronics and industrial supplies to the u s dropped in some cases foreign suppliers were unable to fill the void so many measures of factory activity and demand slid global growth and investment would have likely been higher in the absence of trade uncertainty from the u s china fight said sergi lanau deputy chief economist at the institute of international finance overall china s imports dropped 59 billion in 2019 while american imports fell 42 billion according to u s and chinese trade figures compiled by trade data monitor but the declines would have been much larger had trade not been diverted to many other

brazilian farmers have enjoyed higher demand for soybeans especially in 2018 after china halted such purchases from the u s while the american farm sector was mired in a deep slump brazilian oilseed exports to china climbed 8 billion in 2018 alone last year wasn t quite as strong for brazil with soybean exports slipping amid an outbreak of african swine fever that decimated pig herds in china cutting demand for soybean meal used as animal feed still china s imports from brazil climbed 2 billion last year and are up 20 billion since 2017 although chinese buyers paid a premium for brazilian soybeans that didn t fully compensate for the global decline in commodity prices said flavio fran√ßa a soybean and corn analyst at datagro in s√£o paulo farmers here were at least able to sell more and dry up some of their stocks in 2018 and they got some extra income that way he said meanwhile u s imports from mexico saw the second biggest gain of any u s trading partner after vietnam that came even while mexico fielded its own trade issues with the trump administration including negotiating the successor to the north american free trade agreement and u s threats in mid 2019 to impose tariffs on all mexican exports unless mexico slowed the number of central american migrants arriving at the u s border europe the export engine of europe germany suffered from weaker demand in china

economists at jpmorgan while the trump administration has threatened to impose broad tariffs on europe for a range of reasons the only ones actually implemented were global steel and aluminum tariffs in early 2018 and a relatively modest set affecting about 7 5 billion of goods that was allowed by a world trade organization ruling over european union aircraft subsidies despite sharp declines in

worst may be over japan s exports to china rose in december for the first time in 10 months some economists say japan s auto makers benefited from the u s china trade dispute as china reduced tariffs on cars imported from countries other than the u s china reduced tariffs on cars imported from countries other than the u s and helped companies such as toyota motor corp which exports its luxury

going forward with the u s china trade war at a standstill the international monetary fund predicts global trade growth will improve to about 3 in 2020 from about 1 last year for now that forecast assumes the truces between the u s and major trading partners remain in place and that a number of big emerging markets like brazil mexico india and russia experience economic improvements bolstering those forecasts global manufacturing data showed signs of stabilizing early this year but that outlook was largely formed before the coronavirus outbreak in china added a completely new sort of uncertainty to global trade in 2020 the virus is likely to cause at least some disruption to supply chains and trade as health officials around the world work to contain its spread and with the u s also retaining tariffs on nearly 370 billion a year of chinese imports it may be too soon to say the global trading environment will improve while vietnam for example may be winning some new factories a downturn in u s china trade and the rising tide of protectionism globally are big negatives said ben bland director of the southeast asia project at the lowy institute source dow jones
central banks have lost control of global liquidity the us dollarised international financial system has become treacherously unstable and vulnerable to a sudden reversal in capital flows yet the international monetary fund is a diminished force and no longer has the firepower to act as the world s lender of last resort in an emergency that is the stark conclusion of a g20 task force of leading currency experts a surge in offshore us dollar lending has exploded to us18 trillion leaving existing financial architecture vulnerable credit phil carrick a surge in offshore us dollar lending increasingly through opaque security markets has exploded to us18 trillion 27 trillion and has overwhelmed the safety buffers of the existing financial architecture the concern is that a continued surge in the value of the us dollar potentially triggered by the coronavirus epidemic or any other black swan catalyst could bring this to a head the risk of an unexpected and unplanned reversal of abundant global liquidity hangs over the world economy strong contagion across markets could make the endogenous dynamics of global liquidity very dangerous the panel warned in an advisory report for g20 ministers the financial stability board and the imf
like many lebanese jesuit priest gabriel khairallah has been on the front lines of anti government protests for more than three months i mean what am i doing on the front i am against corruption and seeking social justice and the same for the doctors he says he s done much more than protest on the streets in recent weeks he also opened a low cost medical clinic in the annex of beirut s st joseph church in khairallah s clinic which is run mostly by volunteers the cost of a visit is about 5 and is waived for those who can t afford it more than 30 doctors serve on a rotating basis providing specialized care in cardiology pediatrics gynecology and orthopedics khairallah also corralled pharmacies to donate certain medicines we are collecting from every person of goodwill says khairallah we are not expecting a miracle we hope to create a place where people feel respected a perfect economic storm the need for such a clinic arose as lebanon s economic woes sparked spontaneous mass protests last october a million people took to the streets initially anger surged over a new tax on internet voice call services and expanded to demand the ouster of the government the protests peaceful for months grew more violent in december as riot police used water cannons tear gas and rubber bullets to stop thousands from demonstrating in front of the parliament building lebanon is one of the most indebted nations in the world for decades the central bank serviced debt by offering high interest rates to attract capital but it reached a point that people began to realize it s not sustainable and the government is just accumulating more debt and the banks are further away from solvency says paul salem president of the middle east institute in washington d c over the past 18 months with a decline in oil prices remittances from lebanese working in the gulf also have shrunk it s causing a reverse sucking motion salem says with people not sending money and trying to pull their money out lebanon s worsening economic crisis has had dire consequences for the country s medical care doctors have staged sit ins at hospitals to warn of shortages of lifesaving medicines and supplies which can no longer be obtained from international suppliers due to a shortage of u s dollars patients began skipping doctor visits vaccinations and prescriptions because they could no longer afford them as insurance policies lapsed amid widespread unemployment more and more people are not able to pay the fees doctor fees khairallah says as the protest movement gained strength in october lebanese banks closed for two weeks when the banks reopened they restricted lines of credit and the central bank began to limit u s dollar withdrawals the first to suffer were businesses requiring hard currency including medical suppliers which could only access 50 of the dollars needed to purchase goods the lebanese government also failed to reimburse private and public hospitals for medical care to patients covered by social security and military health accounts according to human rights watch the world is collapsing on top of everyone khairallah s new clinic has quickly become a lifeline for patients who crowd into a small waiting room i was in the middle class before says a middle aged woman who would not give her name chagrined by showing up at a free clinic she had been forgoing medical appointments until this clinic opened she recently lost her job at a university now she struggles she curses lebanon s political elite for stealing the country people who have money can t withdraw it the world is collapsing on top of everyone she says referring to currency controls that limit lebanese bank withdrawals atms no longer dispense dollars and depositors must wait in long lines to withdraw small sums each week on jan 25 the 100th day of anti government protests khairallah was back on the streets weaving his way through thousands of people waving lebanese flags and chanting slogans against the government to show the power that we are here and we are not afraid he was joined by dr mouin jammal an internal medicine specialist the head doctor for khairallah s new clinic we still have to make more pressure that s why we are here says jammal he wants the central bank to raise the dollar limits for medical supplies before hospitals run out we will not wait until it s really empty he says about the dwindling hospital stocks this is why we are making pressure to avoid the crisis bloated bureaucracy the fix for lebanon s health care crisis will require reforming the country s bloated and inefficient bureaucracy say doctors who have worked in lebanon s system for years the ministry of health is a corrupt ministry completely says dr karam karam a clinical professor of medicine at the american university of beirut who served as health minister in the 1990s while in office karam says he introduced a transparent bidding process to combat bribery on purchases of medicine and medical supplies from abroad we saved almost 50 million he says in just one year and cut kickbacks by the same amount do you think anyone says thank you since then corruption in the health ministry has escalated says dr ismail sukkarieh a gastroenterologist and member of parliament in the 1990s everything is on the basis of financial calculations the mentality of business not the mentality of responsibility he says there are already critical shortages of medicine hospitals have stopped performing nonessential surgeries and closed entire wings for lack of patients economist nisreen salti an associate professor at the american university of beirut who studies the health sector believes it is unlikely there will be a complete breakdown in the health care system but believes the availability of expensive and critical life saving medicines including cancer drugs will decline except to the privileged a shrinking pool of people covered by what is available lebanon was once proud of its health care sector despite the corruption but things are different now she says even if these acts of cleaning up take place we always revert back to a state where things lack transparency again and drug prices seem to be artificially high salti says she warns the lebanese will be less healthy because of rising unemployment and diminished resources for housing and food which are linked with health i fear that the deep erosion is one that is difficult to recover from and to correct she says we cannot rely on donors dr elie saliba a pediatric orthopedic surgeon also worries about long term erosion as he gives a visitor a tour of a special center for children with cerebral palsy in the sprawling hospital of bhannes hospitality center for charity sisters compound in bikfaya an hour s drive from beirut saliba splits his practice at night he provides free medical care for anti government protesters injured by security police and by day he sees his usual patients and is on call at the children s center there are 80 children in a space filled with brightly colored exercise equipment for daily therapies and classrooms that accommodate child sized wheelchairs the cost for residential care is more than 1 000 per month he says the government has paid 400 of that amount for each patient he says but no longer does due to the economic crisis the rest of the the center s budget comes from private donors he says but we cannot rely on donors in this period many of the richest lebanese the facility s traditional benefactors have left the country and no longer make charitable donations and those of more modest means now have even less to give the upshot saliba says we may close at the end of the year copyright 2020 npr to see more visit

the trump administration is floating a budget that will be released in full later today and while it conforms to the modern reality it looks like it will be more bad news for fiscal traditionalists i count myself a member of that now rare group being old enough to remember the days before dick cheney informed us that deficits don t matter and non partisan enough to regard ever increasing debt as an issue regardless of which party is in power on the surface this budget appears to be the opposite of fiscal irresponsibility with a proposal for over 4 trillion including spending cuts but the rationale behind those cuts and the politics and power dynamic of the rest of d c makes this yet another year when we can expect a massive deficit it should be pointed out that presidential budgets are not really anything more than wish lists according to the u s constitution fiscal power rests with congress and more specifically with the house of representatives so when as is now the case the white house and that body are controlled by different parties the chances of the president s budget being adopted are virtually zero what they often do though is set the tone this one is designed to be an accompaniment to yet another round of big tax cuts the president has already voiced a desire to cut personal income taxes this year which given that it is an election year should come as no surprise to anyone that fact will also make it difficult for democrats to completely nix any tax relief for the middle class but then nor are they likely to approve a spending plan that increases defense spending but cuts domestic safety net and foreign aid programs dramatically what you think politically is not the point here whether you view those priorities as fully justified or inherently evil the fact is that we are headed for another year when spending will be cut minimally if at all but revenue will shrink once again add that to deficit spending for the current fiscal year of 1 1 trillion and a national debt of over 23 trillion and it starts to look like a problem there are those that maintain that it isn t the theory is that as the u s government has the power to tax such a massive economy and the dollar is the international reserve currency america can operate with any level of debt they might choose that is right in a way but it assumes that nothing will change that is an assumption that history reveals as not just overly optimistic but quite frankly ridiculous at some point the economic cycle or some unforeseen catastrophe will cause a downturn and when it does deficits will matter very much there is nothing wrong with governments running deficits they are a useful tool to smooth out economic cycles the problem is running them during times of economic strength and expansion when the inevitable downturn comes attitudes will shift the government will still have the ability to tax a large economy but that economy will shrink an unspecified amount then the assumption that nothing will change will kick into reverse just as now no end is seen to the good times so then no end will be seen to the bad that will sap confidence starting a vicious cycle of investors demanding higher returns from treasuries to offset risk which increases risk leading to higher rates etc etc until interest payments suck everything from the economy the reckoning will only come when times are bad already which severely limits the options for dealing with the situation you can print money to pay the interest and principle when due but that will devalue the currency and make future inflation a danger or you can increase taxes and or cut spending neither of which are a good idea in a shrinking economy there simply is no good option politicians of course don t care they make the perfectly reasonable assumption that by the time that particular chicken comes home to roost they will be either dead or out of power in which case it will be someone else s problem more worrying to me is that a lot of economists are giving them that justification saying that the last thirty years or so prove that cheney was right deficits really don t matter what they seem to forget is that that has followed a period in the 80s when the debt was ultra low and during which the government ran at a surplus we are far from that now proponents of deficit spending will frequently tell you that government finance is not akin to household budgeting and that applying your common sense to the issue somehow makes you na√Øve there is an element of truth to that we as householders cannot tax others to bring in guaranteed income and for us printing money while technically possible tends to have some bad consequences and is generally discouraged by various members of law enforcement however the basic principles of fiscal responsibility and debt management still apply increasing debt during good times is simply not a good idea and we should all do our best to make sure that the politicians of both parties are aware that we know that the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
this article is more than 4 years old there has not been a federal budget surplus since bill clinton was president not long ago president trump s new foundation for american greatness budget proposed to balance the books by 2027 by imputing an annual economic growth rate of three percent that optimistic growth rate didn t materialize and sustain yet it still undergirds the brand new white house 2021 budget for america s future proposal only this time around balance is to come in 15 years cq roll call inc via getty images the new white house budget for america s future proposes 4 829 trillion in outlays for fiscal year 2021 with annual spending projected to top 6 trillion by 2028 the breakdown table s 4 proposed budget by category p 112 in billions as in bezos is defense 754 non defense discretionary 722 mandatory social security medicare medicaid 2 966 interest 378 politicians regularly indulge in debate over how much extra an already too big federal government should spend on entitlement military and discretionary categories that are each excessive there s simply not enough cash to cover them all so the fy 2021 deficit would be 966 billion it s already forecast at over 1 trillion this current fiscal year the new budget aims at dropping the deficit to 261 billion in 2030 and balancing things five years later p 7 yeah right speculative sustained economic growth of three percent per year would be driven presumably by tax policy changes but also by continued regulatory liberalization while i doubt the targets this latter is important perhaps under appreciated presidential budgets signal priorities to congress and it seems every american president s fiscal budget gets declared doa budgets are both ignored and attacked by congress lack of deficit and debt restraint even with the benefit of a healthy economy and low interest rates is a problem for stability and long term economic health the national debt now stands at 23 2 trillion up more than 2 trillion since 2018 keynesian rescue by deficit spending during some future recession becomes unavailable since the truck s already been unloaded to see why things are worrisome consider the main competing projections on fiscal health published at the end of january the congressional budget office s january 2020 budget and economic outlook covering 2020 to 2030 predicts that discretionary entitlement and interest spending will rocket to nearly 7 5 trillion by 2030 cbo projects a deficit over 1 trillion in 2023 and a shocking 1 4 trillion deficit by 2027 that s a trillion more than the white house posits yet even fiscal conservatives have lost the appetite for addressing deficits the lack of urgency extends to the president who asked staff to look for big cuts in his second term who the hell cares about the budget trump reportedly proclaimed at a january 2020 fundraiser if this keeps up more will be spent on debt service than on the entire defense budget particularly as interest rates rise already real debt levels on the fiscal budget and un reckoned with entitlements can be vastly higher than the public is generally told meanwhile magical thinking that government outlays create wealth is fashionable among progressives who advocate medicare for all a green new deal and a guaranteed national income the trump budget projections back off a sumertime deal with congress on non defense domestic spending that deal will likely stick though meaning cuts won t materialize and trump s lowered deficits won t appear the cbo figures will be closer to the mark still as russell vought acting director of the office of management and budget put it we believe we can make a big dent and get back in the realm of fiscal responsibility lots of cuts are proposed for social programs like medicaid disability and food stamps there are big cuts slated for the environmental protection agency and departments like commerce education housing and urban development and state including foreign aid but not ukraine also invoked are proposed reductions in growth of the federal payroll by aligning to private sector p 21 and eliminating improper payouts p 22 there s less on border wall than the prior request the prominent exception to social program cuts is a new federal family leave program p 74 something trump touted during the past two state of the union addresses which heralds new regulation on private employers later trump would also expand regulation of tobacco products with an all new agency p 53 the bulk of federal social spending is on autopilot if trump s growth projections are wrong and or cuts never emerge rising interest rates on the accumulated debt could mean a tailspin while republicans in the 1990s promised to get rid of entire departments like energy and education there s nothing remotely like that going on now that era was a big contrast to today s big science big infrastructure big homeland security and looming big compromise with democrats on infrastructure outlays streamlining of and spending on which partly and paradoxically partly undergirds the fy 2021 budget s growth projections when the issue is finally forced upon us a fruitful approach on domestic concerns like transportation education health job training and other grant in aid programs now topping 600 billion annually would be to leave the dollars in the states as former u s senator and federal judge james l buckley argues in saving congress from itself it s remarkable how big the federal government has become and how easily it absorbs and regulates private activity from the top down which gradually ceases to be seen as regulation apart from the untethered spending though there is some continued good news in this budget economic growth matters and prior trump budgets have and this one continues to emphasize regulatory liberalization red tape relief freeing up productivity and ingenuity feeds back into the fiscal statistics and gives breathing room until congress fixes the deficit debt autopilot spending problems according to the new budget the trump economy stands firm on the proven pro growth pillars of tax cuts deregulation energy independence and better trade deals p 5 i like the first two of those in particular but in any event fiscal budgets and regulatory concerns are intertwined regulation which has macroeconomic effects is even less disciplined than spending is so a little relief can go a long way as the council of economic advisers has pointed out this theme needs much more exploration back in the 2018 budget proposal the administration said we must eliminate every outdated unnecessary or ineffective federal regulation and move aggressively to build regulatory frameworks that stimulate rather than stagnate job creation even for those regulations we must leave in place we must strike every provision that is counterproductive ineffective or outdated pp 1 2 similarly last year s budget talked of cutting the red tape unleashing economic freedom p 13 trump s budgets uniquely reference anticipated savings from regulatory rollbacks reforms and a regulatory oversight agenda fueled by executive orders earlier budgets invoked bipartisan pro liberalization reform proposals like improved air traffic control and highway tolling while trump has added plenty regulation of his own he has in many respects frozen the traditional rulemaking apparatus the theme is continued in the fy2021 budget capping federal spending is important but so too is capping what the government can force the private sector to spend on regulation as trump s 2018 budget had put it everyone believes in and supports safe food supplies and clean air and water but the agencies of the federal government have gone way beyond what was originally intended by the congress in the new budget s entry on regulation relief the president s budget message to congress says p 2 many pundits and washington insiders laughed when i promised to cut two regulations for every new regulation our commitment to regulatory reform stems from the simple truth that the vast majority of business owners want to do the right thing comply with the law and treat their workers fairly the federal government ignored this reality for far too long and abused its authority to go after businesses especially small businesses and entrepreneurs in ways that can only be described as arbitrary and abusive the united states environmental record is one of the strongest in the world and continues to have some of the cleanest air and water in the world getting control of regulatory overreach at least partly improves prospects for getting spending under control it hasn t worked yet though it s one of those necessary but not sufficient sorts of things the continued changes in the regulatory enterprise that trump proposes in his budget should positively affect economic growth statistics and in turn fiscal bottom lines if the federal government can restrain itself in historic red tape relief pp 19 20 the new budget describes cutting regulatory costs of billions rather than adding billions as had been the prior approach the document emphasizes small business farmers barriers to energy production and states the strategy is simple by eliminating or amending costs that are duplicative unnecessary ineffective or unduly burdensome the administration is unleashing the ingenuity determination and know how of the private sector which has always been the principal driver of american prosperity what next emphasis in 2020 includes purported new regulatory savings from reductions in fleet mandates for corporate average fuel economy standards a rewrite of the waters of the united states environmental rule and improvements in agency guidance documents that influence business it is unlikely in this election year so long as the economy remains healthy that congress will recognize the background role of red tape reforms in its own deliberations and scoring of what ultimately emerges as the fiscal year 2021 federal budget when it does someday there are solutions waiting on the shelf they include the now dormant but bipartisan regulatory accountability act that would codify certain regulatory oversight principles that have long bipartisan pedigree as the new budget says american families and entrepreneurs are not the enemy and it is long past time the federal government stopped treating them as such if congress can t tame the deficit maybe those families and entrepreneurs can
the first stage of the market fallout from the virus outbreak was about positioning adjustment the second stage which is the reaction to policy guidance has been underway since last monday when the pboc began turning the stimulus taps on the third step timing a potential turning point for asia macro however remains less clear pending clarity on peak virus outbreak and broader appraisal of the economic fallout above and beyond just tourism so with the thought that global central banks are more than willing to cover the markets back the extent to which investors look through weak china data in the coming weeks will help determine whether a rebound trade has the legs to run china returns from the holidays with global equity markets trading on the back foot but the decline in comprehensive economic data concerning the extent china s economy comes back on line should not be underestimated on the one hand coronavirus cases and deaths have stabilized in contrast some companies e g toyota foxconn have announced they will remain shut even after the end of the lunar year end holiday us equities were weaker friday as a robust us payrolls report was unable to deflect renewed concerns around the coronavirus traders moved into sell first ask question later mode when singapore raised its alert level after three cases of the virus were confirmed at the same time in the us four passengers from a cruise ship docked in new jersey were hospitalized on coronavirus concerns which continues to raise fast spread virus concerns beyond china borders while a more fundamental issue is one about how much the market can believe the data but knowing that the damage is done in china and the virus data seems to be peaking so the numbers that the market is apt to take most at face value are the infections outside china and in particular the relatively low mortality rates which should be viewed positively on sunday data was released indicating there is a downward trend in newly reported coronavirus cases in china if the numbers are accurate and the zhong nanshan scenario holds implying peak virus would hit last week that would be tremendously useful news fore regional health concerns and then of course for local markets this could see some long usdasia gamma flush this morning and provide some relief to china proxies however commodities remain laggards with some chinese importers even starting to declare force majeure and china growth proxy currencies like the aud closed at its lowest level since march 2009 on friday after rba governor lowe cited a higher risk to growth from the coronavirus compared to sars beyond the china narrative there has been an increased demand for twse index protection in japan price action was heavily skewed lower led by internet financials electrical appliances and australian macro sensitive mining stocks went on offer while outside of equities iron ore bulls reduced longs and fast money sold copper and bought silver this week will be a bit of gut check time for those playing the asia macro rebound trade but while a plethora of uncertainties remains one sure thing is that the mother of all stimulus measures will get laid down by the pboc but will it be enough remains the question as no one appears in much of a rush to put risk back on out of the gates this morning oil markets one might be wrong to think that there is no more downside for oil now that brent has reached the lower 50 s the market is struggling with yesterday s proposal from opec s joint technical committee for an additional 600kb d cut from the opec alliance that would run at least through mid year which has failed to alleviate the pressure on oil in part because the proposal has yet to be formally discussed by opec ministers and because russia continues to push back against further cuts and if the cartel fails to reach an agreement there will be more pain to come in oil downside there is a clear fundamental cause of why oil prices may settle lower demand is not sufficiently responsive enough to lower prices and outside of opec only us tight oil stands as the most quickly responsive supply to prices in order to make a dent in global oil supplies us drilling activities need to fall in this scenario wti prices may need to drop below usd 47 bbl for a lengthy period and the demand devastation of gigantic proportions like what s happening in china could set the stage for a shift in oil prices towards those critical break evens before relief sets in but what continues to be absent in the oil narrative these days is bearish for oil case is that opec s total share of the oil market has fallen to 35 they no longer have a monopoly on oil prices suggesting even with opec production cut those non opec nations with low break evens could still pump and monetize barrels and while there is a rationale for nyet as russia break evens are much lower as alexander novak who threw cold water on hopes for a short term opec cut even a dah response still might not be sufficient enough compliance response let s not try to sugar coat things here with a chunk of china s industrial complex have been shuttered for an extended beyond lny we re headed for one of the worst q1 economic growth periods on record with a significant haircut yet to be completely factored into the equation so for the finely tuned global oil supply balances it could be devastating if the data comes in worse than expected gold markets investors should continue to favor more defensive fixed income and therefore long gold positions until the impact of ncov on growth becomes apparent but its what brings the fed into play is the real question for gold bulls and it s probably not going to be the coronavirus currency markets asia fx the malaysian ringgit the malaysia ringgit remained under pressure on general asia de risking but after the rate cut last month the market is pricing the bnm delivering another reduction in h1 mainly as the virus weighs on growth via tourism consumption as well as to defend against the potential disruption in the supply chain linkages with china the thai baht there are a number of reasons why the thai currency is vulnerable the most apparent being coronavirus s drag on tourism a significant contributor to thailand s gdp but there are others a deterioration in domestic banks credit drought and currency outflows via a potential tesco supermarket deal to name a few the basket asia currency markets have been remarkably orderly thanks to the pboc who continue to lay monetary policy and verbal intervention on thick and heavy last people s bank of china s deputy governor pan says they will boost counter cyclical adjustments and keep markets stable while hinting at addition mlf and lpr cut in february still there was a surprising degree of risk complacency at least that was the case until friday when gamma caught a bid tone across the board in g10 and usdasia as investors don t want to be caught out in the event of any escalation of the coronavirus outbreak over the weekend cross currency traders bid up both usdcnh and usdkrw as the primary currency hedge against coronavirus risk the market seems keen on owning low yielder asia gamma as those pairs have shown higher beta to virus news rather than the higher yielding usdinr usdidr and usd php g 10 markets the australian dollar audusd vols and risk reversals jumped higher friday as spot head lower closely tracking usdcnh but with the policy pboc policy stimulus pump about to hose down the market and with eurozone getting ready to spend more to boost the flagging economy commodities could get a little bit perky but it remains challenging being the only person in the room supporting that trade this morning as the focus remains on coronavirus fear the euro the euro continues to languish through the risk on risk off roro cycle there is no haven appetite as europe has the developed world s lowest real yields but when risk appetite turns on because of those low yields the euro becomes the world s best funder as everyone short trades the euro to fund those em carry trades it s a continuous cycle of lose lose for the euro

other revisions primarily from decreasing natural gas prices compared to year end 2018 304 bcfe of reductions due to the reclassification of pud s through compliance with the sec 5 year rule and 872 bcfe negative revisions due to plans changes from our continued focus on portfolio optimization proved developed and undeveloped reserves were 4 839 bcfe 57 and 3 587 bcfe 43 respectively for 2019 puds at year end 2019 represent 67 of the total wells the company expects to drill over the next five years the low pud to 5 year plan percentage implies meaningful future upside in both the marcellus

expected ultimate recoveries eurs averaging 2 6 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral completion optimization continues to drive eur improvements in the marcellus shale this is accomplished through our utilization of new technology and refinements to our engineering approaches that allow for decreased cycle times and better recovery of our in place resources these improvements have allowed the company to book marcellus shale puds with average eurs of over 2 7 bcfe per thousand feet of completed lateral compared to 2 4 bcfe per thousand feet booked in 2018 during 2019 in the utica shale cnx turned in line til 10 gross wells with an average completed lateral length of approximately 6 400 feet a majority of our proved undeveloped locations exist in our ohio and cpa

advertisement london cnn business nearly two decades have passed since a coronavirus known as sars emerged in china killing hundreds of people and sparking panic that sent a chill through the global economy the virus now rampaging across china could be much more damaging china has become an indispensable part of global business since the 2003 sars outbreak it s grown into the world s factory churning out products such as the iphone and driving demand for commodities like oil and copper the country also boasts hundreds of millions of wealthy consumers who spend big on luxury products tourism and cars china s economy accounted for roughly 4 of world gdp in 2003 it now makes up 16 of global output sars sickened 8 098 people and killed 774 before it was contained the new coronavirus which originated in the central chinese city of wuhan has already killed more than 900 people and infected over 40 000 across at least 25 countries and territories chinese officials have locked down wuhan and several other cities but the virus continues to spread the outbreak has the potential to cause severe economic and market dislocation but the scale of the impact will ultimately be determined by how the virus spreads and evolves which is almost impossible to predict as well as how governments respond said neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics compounding the risk is the fact that the world outside china has also changed since 2003 globalization has encouraged companies to build supply chains that cut across national borders making economies much more interconnected the major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis and global debt levels have never been higher rising nationalism may make it harder to coordinate a worldwide response if that s required a resident wears a protective mask while riding a scooter on february 5 2020 in wuhan the virus is snarling supply chains and disrupting companies car plants across china have been ordered to remain closed following the lunar new year holiday preventing global automakers volkswagen vlkaf toyota tm daimler ddaif general motors gm renault rnlsy honda hmc and hyundai hymtf from resuming operations in the world s largest car market according to s p global ratings the outbreak will force carmakers in china to slash production by about 15 in the first quarter toyota said on friday it would keep its factories shut at least until february 17 luxury goods makers which rely on chinese consumers who spend big at home and while on vacation have also been hit british brand burberry bbryf has closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland china and its chief executive warned friday that the virus is causing a material negative effect on luxury demand dozens of global airlines have curtailed flights to and from china even more troubling is the threat to global supply chains qualcomm qcom the world s biggest maker of smartphone chips warned that the outbreak was causing significant uncertainty around demand for smartphones and the supplies needed to produce them already auto parts shortages have forced hyundai hymtf to close plants in south korea and caused fiat chrysler fcau to make contingency plans to avoid the same result at one of its plants in europe economists say the current level of disruption is manageable if the number of new coronavirus cases begins to slow and china s factories reopen soon the result will be a fleeting hit to the chinese economy in the first quarter and a dent in global growth if the virus continues to spread however the economic damage will increase rapidly an employee works on an assembly line at dongfeng honda in wuhan mohamed el erian chief economic adviser to allianz alizf told cnn business that he was most worried about the potential cascading economic effects they first paralyze the region of the virus outbreak he said then they gradually spread domestically undermining internal trade consumption production and the movement of people if the virus is still not contained the process spreads further including regionally and internationally by disrupting trade supply chains and travel epidemic risk economists have a hard time working out the potential costs of epidemics because of their unique characteristics yet diseases can be far more damaging than natural disasters such as hurricanes or a tsunami or other unpredictable events known as black swans according to a study by the world bank a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5 of global gdp or more than 3 trillion losses from a weaker flu pandemic such as the 2009 h1n1 virus can still wipe 0 5 off global gdp a severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden profound and widespread impact the world bank assessed in a report on pandemics from 2013 the wuhan coronavirus has not been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the virus is not the driving factor behind those losses however instead it s the way consumers businesses and governments respond to an outbreak that matters most people are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick preventing them from traveling shopping and working doing so limits demand for consumer goods and energy decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories meanwhile curtail production this is continuing to grow in scope and magnitude it could end being really really big and really really serious we can t project that now said william reinsch a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies who spent 15 years as president of the national foreign trade council according to shearing past epidemics show that china s economy is likely to take a significant hit in the first quarter but that will quickly fade from memory if the virus is contained as long as factory closures don t lead to job losses by this time next year the level of gdp is unlikely to be very different from what it would have been without the virus he said what can be done china s government has moved quickly to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus and the measures taken to contain it the people s bank of china cut a key interest rate this week and injected huge amounts of cash into markets in order to help take the pressure off banks and borrowers officials have also announced new tax breaks and subsidies designed to help consumers yet china is also more vulnerable to a crisis than it was 17 years ago when sars broke out it has much higher debt trade tensions with a major trading partner and its growth has been steadily slowing down for a number of years which gives a weak starting point to face such a crisis said raphie hayat a senior economist at dutch bank rabobank analysts at capital economics expect the government to announce additional measures in the coming days if the virus keeps spreading they believe that beijing will have to abandon its long running efforts to get its debt under control and pump money directly into the economy central banks in neighboring countries including sri lanka malaysia thailand and the philippines have cut interest rates in recent weeks south korea and taiwan could be next but the big powers of the financial world are exhausted from a decade fighting anemic growth since the global financial crisis the european central bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and hasn t been able to increase them since while the bank of japan is in a similar position the us federal reserve already cut interest rates three times last year chair jerome powell has said he s carefully monitoring the situation meanwhile debt levels have soared in the united states japan and key european countries including italy limiting the scope for a big fiscal stimulus if the world economy goes into another tailspin global debt including borrowing by households governments and companies has jumped to more than three times the size of the global economy the highest ratio on record according to the institute of international finance also critical is whether governments are able to coordinate their response to the outbreak ideally with help from multinational institutions this is especially true because according to the world bank preparedness for a potential pandemic is low but coordination may prove difficult in a increasingly fractured world where nationalism is often prized over cooperation it s quite clear that multinational institutions are under more pressure and have less teeth on day to day issues than 10 years ago shearing said but the optimist in me would like to think that in the face of a global pandemic global institutions are still in a position to respond correction an earlier version of this story misidentified raphie hayat s employer
with mariana alfaro with mariana alfaro the big idea hudson n h karen forleo thinks it would be a debacle if democrats nominate bernie sanders on the eve of the new hampshire primary the retired dental hygienist remains undecided between four of his rivals she loves pete buttigieg s youthful vigor joe biden s experience elizabeth warren s plans and amy klobuchar s grit but the 62 year old isn t sure who is the best bet to stop sanders i know he appeases the young students who have no money well somebody has to pay for everything he wants forleo said sunday night after watching biden speak for 90 minutes in a high school gymnasium here she plans to attend rallies this afternoon for klobuchar in exeter and warren in portsmouth the democrat from lyndeborough who supported hillary clinton in the 2016 primary remains frustrated that sanders didn t do more to help her that fall if bernie leads the ticket i don t think the american people are going to be ready for that i don t think he can beat donald trump she said and if donald trump thought he could trump would be all over him like he is with joe biden advertisement the splintering among moderates like forleo is an important part of the explanation for why sanders the independent senator from neighboring vermont is the favorite to win tuesday s contest this is my sixth day on the ground here and i ve watched all the democratic contenders interact with voters based on dozens of interviews and public polling there s a very fluid and incredibly tight three way battle for third place buttigieg has surged since the iowa caucuses a week ago into a solid second place position prompting attacks from all directions that appear to have slowed his momentum a bit biden has been tanking in the polls since finishing fourth in iowa prompting many people who had planned to vote for him because they perceived him as the most electable option to check out others klobuchar has been rising drawing her biggest crowds of the campaign this weekend and reporting her best fundraising days yet after friday night s debate warren who represents neighboring massachusetts and led in polls of this state last summer seems to be losing altitude here on the ground even though she finished ahead of klobuchar in iowa about a third of the people at her rally at a middle school in concord on sunday afternoon streamed out before she finished talking a brew of other factors is also working to sanders s advantage on the eve of the first in the nation primary most democrats don t want sanders to be their nominee but they cannot agree on who to rally behind instead despite rumbling concerns of the establishment there s no organized stop sanders or never bernie movement in fact democrats who don t support sanders still hold largely favorable views of him unlike in iowa where he faced nearly a million dollars in attack ads no one is on the air here with anti sanders commercials advertisement sanders expanded his lead sunday night in the final day of the boston globe wbz suffolk tracking poll he garnered 27 percent among likely democratic presidential primary voters up from 24 to 25 percent in the previous six polls buttigieg who briefly eclipsed sanders in the poll one day last week got 19 percent in the latest survey followed by klobuchar at 14 percent biden and warren tied at 12 points the margin of error is plus or minus 4 4 percent you should take all the polling with a grain of salt because this contest is so in flux but two other surveys published sunday also showcased sanders s relative strength among likely voters a university of new hampshire poll for cnn put sanders at 28 percent with buttigieg at 21 percent biden at 12 percent and everyone else in single digits buttigieg led among voters who identify themselves as moderate or conservative while sanders led by more than 25 points among self identified liberals asked whom they expect to win regardless of whom they re supporting 57 percent in the cnn picked sanders interestingly sanders also took a seven point lead over biden on the question of which candidate has the best chance to defeat trump in november a reversal since iowa a yougov poll for cbs pegged sanders at 29 percent up two points compared to last month with buttigieg at 25 percent most of buttigieg s double digit gains in that survey come at the expense of biden who fell to 12 percent trailing warren only 39 percent of likely voters in the cbs poll said they ve definitely made their final decision and only six in 10 said they re enthusiastic about the candidate they re leaning toward sanders s supporters were the most enthusiastic they compete for different kinds of voters but sanders has been attacking buttigieg partly out of a desire to prevent him from coalescing moderate support and thereby overtaking him in this must win state sanders could benefit from a similar dynamic to what allowed trump to amass an unsurpassable delegate led during the 2016 republican primaries even as most gop voters opposed him the odds at least initially are that all the top contenders will stay in the race beyond new hampshire continuing to divide up support going into the next two early states mike bloomberg is waiting in the wings spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars in states that vote on march 3 also known as super tuesday when a third of all pledged delegates to the convention are awarded advertisement four years ago sanders struggled with nonwhite voters and hit a wall because of latinos in nevada and african americans in south carolina the next two states to vote the senator has worked hard to make inroads with communities of color ever since and biden s fade could boost sanders in the palmetto state by dividing up the black vote the sanders campaign which has invested heavily in organization said that volunteers knocked on more than 150 000 doors on saturday alone sanders s field program is focused more on mobilization of known supporters than persuasion of the undecided a contrast to the late surging campaigns like klobuchar s and buttigieg s who are still trying to identify potential backers the campaign said 1 981 people attended sanders s rally last night in keene rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y will join sanders tonight for a massive concert the campaign is putting on in durham home to the university of new hampshire featuring the strokes and sunflower bean the sanders campaign slogan is us not me but his stump speech increasingly sounds like us versus them and the them is the party establishment he s added a little more pitchfork to his populist tone in the recent days we re taking on not only the whole republican political establishment and trump sanders said this weekend we re taking on the democratic establishment his supporters from four years ago remain angry at the system and feel let down by both parties the undercurrent of anti elite frustration that helped propel trump still exists in 2020 despite strong top line economic indicators nick landry 27 of somersworth said he has tried hard to keep an open mind since supporting sanders four years ago he considered warren very strongly he heard out entrepreneur andrew yang who was intriguing but he found his plan to give everyone a thousand bucks a month kind of gimmicky after watching the democratic debate on friday night he decided he ll probably back sanders again advertisement we lost in 2016 by trying to play to the middle as a liberal i believe we should swing for the fences and if we re not going to win let s at least go down pushing for progressive ideals landry said at a sanders rally in the packed to capacity opera house in rochester biden represents the establishment and i think pete and amy are part of the establishment the data analyst for an insurance company supports medicare for all and badly wants stricter gun laws so that his kids will be safer at school landry said he totally understands why some democrats fixate on electability but he said trump and senate republicans have shown themselves to be such cartoonish villains that he doesn t believe the opposition should pander to win back the kinds of voters who supported barack obama in 2012 but trump in 2016 they re keeping kids in cages landry said i don t want to necessarily be shaping our political platform around trying to appeal to people who aren t bothered by that meanwhile moderate voters express growing concern about what they see as a collective action problem siobhan brace 62 was the first person to ask biden a question during his town hall meeting on sunday night i love you a lot but i am undecided she said i thought everybody did a great job in the debate but i am afraid of that one of you cannot beat but i think all of you could is there some way that you guys could put a dream team together and present that to the american people and just say like amy is going to be vice president and we ll put andrew in charge of commerce advertisement the crowd cheered biden laughed there s two ways to be on the dream team run it or be picked he replied i promise that you my administration will look like the country it will be made up of women and blacks and browns and people who represent the diversity of the country there are at least six women i can think of at the top of my head who i wouldn t have a moment s hesitation in asking to be my vice president i can say the same thing for at least four leading african americans that i know reflecting the degree to which voters still believe he s in contention biden was asked again half an hour later who he might pick for vice president biden said he didn t want to be presumptuous but then he hinted that he might select buttigieg the 77 year old said he could promise that he would not pick anyone who is older than him to be his no 2 which would take out the 78 year old sanders biden added that he cannot imagine picking someone to be vice president who supports medicare for all a knock against sanders but there are at least four people running that are in fact simpatico with where i am starting with indiana he said a reference to buttigieg the former mayor of south bend ind brace who asked the first question to biden said in an interview afterward that she s terrified trump will win bernie s too way over there she said pointing with her left arm to the other side of the room the republicans that are on the fence are going to come with a moderate we need to get some of the republicans who do know that trump is crazy to come over to our side and they re only going to do it with a moderate so we ve got to find a moderate independents could have outsized influence in tomorrow s open democratic primary because there s not a competitive race on the republican side though trump is flying up here to hold a rally in manchester tonight he faces no competitive gop primary polls show the incumbent president getting more than 90 percent against former massachusetts governor william weld new hampshire has 416 000 unaffiliated voters who get to pick which primary to participate in sanders defeated clinton by 22 points in new hampshire four years ago garnering 60 percent or 152 000 votes polls and interviews make clear that most of the people who backed him as the anti clinton candidate four years ago will not support him again this time that said i encountered a few people at the sanders rally in rochester who backed clinton in the primary four years ago and are giving sanders a close look advertisement we need grass roots change and it may be more than some of the traditional establishment is willing to go unfortunately said colleen hartnett 57 of windham a software engineer who remains undecided i think i m leaning more toward the progressive side rather than the moderate part of the party at this point because republicans have gone so far the contrast is just striking i feel like the pendulum can t just go for a moderate swing sanders knows he needs to win this neighboring state which is why he doesn t hesitate to confidently predict victory there s no apparent effort to manage expectations i am absolutely confident that with the volunteer support we have we are going to win in new hampshire sanders said saturday night in manchester he said his 2016 victory in new hampshire was critical to winning 22 more states in the months that followed and he said winning the primary helped put some of his ideas that were called radical four years ago into the mainstream we need to complete the revolution we started four years ago in new hampshire he said warren losing altitude in new hampshire also likely works to sanders s advantage she drew only a modest crowd sunday afternoon to a middle school near the state capitol our democracy hangs in the balance and it is up to you massachusetts to decide what to do she said at the end of her speech after more than a hundred people had left many to go watch other candidates advertisement new hampshire people in the audience yelled and to the people of new hampshire she added correcting herself with a laugh the crowd applauded thank you she said appreciatively it is a hard time warren brushed aside a question afterward about the people who left calling it an enthusiastic crowd it looks like it is going to be a long battle to the nomination she told reporters there are 55 more states and territories after this i m in it for the long haul other candidates who struggle to get covered are trying more colorfully to contrast themselves with sanders james carville the democratic strategist who helped elect bill clinton in 1992 stumped late saturday afternoon for sen michael bennet d colo in manchester he emphasized that sanders would be a problem for down ballot democrats especially in competitive senate and house races they ll run away from bernie sanders like the devil running away from holy water carville said if michael bennet is the nominee mitch mcconnell s going to look like he crapped a pineapple former vice president joe biden lobbed attacks feb 9 at former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and sen bernie sanders i vt who returned snipes video the washington post more on 2020 advertisement the iowa democratic party announced last night that buttigieg would probably receive 14 delegates to the national presidential nominating convention from the chaotic caucuses while sanders would receive 12 but the number may not be final isaac stanley becker reports late sunday sanders adviser jeff weaver said the campaign will seek a partial recanvass a process he said would put the senator from vermont on top in the delegate count sanders won the popular vote netting support from about 6 000 more caucus goers on the first expression of preferences known as an alignment than buttigieg but the delegate allocation is based on projected support for each candidate at the state convention known as state delegate equivalents or sdes which is traditionally the metric used to declare a winner of the caucuses weaver said the campaign believes seven sdes are at issue in the precincts they have identified which is more than the 2 77 that separate the two democrats chris meagher a spokesman for buttigieg said we re focused on new hampshire the iowa party also said that eight delegates would go to and six would go to the update from the state party reflected its review of 55 precincts making up about 3 percent of the total 1 765 but the review involved only rectifying discrepancies between numbers reported on math worksheets completed by caucus leaders and publicly reported data that left untouched errors tainting the actual worksheets where volunteer leaders had entered complex calculations based on multiple counts of caucus night preferences and in some cases made mistakes an attorney for the state party said officials were not authorized to alter the worksheets because they represented legal documents according to an email troy price the state party chairman sent to members of the state party s central committee democratic leaders have edged toward the brink of open war with one another in recent days michael scherer and sean sullivan report advisers to the two men most responsible for overseeing the disastrous iowa caucuses national chairman tom perez and iowa chairman troy price have been privately deflecting blame onto each other as the relationship between the two has become tense advisers say price has refused to join perez in calling for a recanvass of voting records in the state after finding out about perez s demand from a deputy a few minutes before it was tweeted price allies blame perez for the botched caucus count pointing to new party rules he implemented around transparency and accessibility that increased the burdens on the state at the start of the campaign sanders advisers repeatedly praised perez but that tone shifted in recent weeks as sanders surrogates supporters and staff have criticized perez for changing the debate rules and for the appointees he has placed on the various convention committees weaver has tried to strike a less aggressive tone saying that the sanders campaign still believes perez has tried to be evenhanded of course given our experience we are ever vigilant he said democrats fear a repeat of the iowa chaos in nevada while some top party leaders call for the end of caucuses top nevada democratic party officials are trying

both left out key details that present a more complicated picture of how they handled what both now say is one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in american history biden not only played a key role in helping bush win passage of the measure but he also privately assured the president that i think you re doing it the exact right way according to notes taken at a meeting by white house press secretary ari fleischer in that meeting bush told biden that though he would attempt to use diplomacy he would use the authority to invade if he believed it was necessary according to fleischer s

cai meng china daily in addition to the human suffering due to lost lives and illness the coronavirus is disrupting the chinese economy in the last few weeks daily life has been disrupted many businesses are closed and many people have lost income in particular many small businesses especially in service sectors will lose a big chunk of their revenue and possibly go bankrupt but experience from past epidemics shows that the nationwide aggregate effects in the long and short terms are likely to be limited the chinese government is taking historically unprecedented steps to limit the spread of the virus and in my view has done so astonishingly rapidly responsible governments and people around the world should be supporting these efforts experts emphasized that china has the macroeconomic policy tools needed to manage the situation kristalina georgieva managing director and chairman of the executive board of the international monetary fund said on feb 3 we support china s efforts to respond including recent fiscal monetary and financial actions we are confident that china s economy remains resilient and the world bank issued a statement supporting china s monetary policy the chinese authorities have policy space to respond and have announced a sizeable injection of liquidity which should help mitigate the costs to economic growth for all chinese and for foreigners living in china the last few weeks have been frightening but the supply of daily necessities has not been interrupted for most people the government s ability to keep supplies flowing into quarantined wuhan has been amazing the soldiers and transport workers who make this possible at the risk of their own lives should be highly praised i m especially moved to see many healthcare workers from all around china heroically going to wuhan although people are scared because of the possibility of evolution and spread of the coronavirus it is important to put it into perspective for example 80 000 people died from the h1n1 flu in the 2018 2019 winter in the united states alone so far flu has killed 10 000 this winter in the us the us center for disease control and prevention expects between 12 000 and 61 000 flu deaths each year in the us no one argues that these deaths are caused by us government inaction a 2017 study published in the lancet estimated that between 291 000 and 646 000 people worldwide die annually from the flu and the world health organization estimates that about 1 4 million people die each year in traffic worldwide with roughly half of those deaths caused by drunk drivers the coronavirus is very serious but even the worst case predictions show much less death and injury than these recurring dangers since we don t yet know how long the coronavirus epidemic will last or how widespread it will be estimates of the impact vary widely on the pessimistic side ren zeping chief economist and director of the evergrande think tank expects the economy to slow to 5 4 percent growth in 2020 his worst case scenario calculates that growth could slow to 5 percent as reported by caixin an independent chinese financial publication on the optimistic side wei shangjin professor at columbia business school and former chief economist of the asian development bank told caixin that he estimates a decline of 0 1 percentage point of growth even in the worst case these aggregate numbers show relatively healthy growth for the overall chinese economy in 2020 however microeconomic impacts in some sectors could be more severe especially since china is a key participant in the global economy imf spokesman gerry rice said if global supply chains were systematically affected or global financial markets were significantly impacted by increasing uncertainty then obviously the impact would be greater the slowdown will affect not only china for example goldman sachs estimates that the coronavirus will reduce the us annualized growth rate by 0 4 percentage point in the first quarter within china small businesses will be the hardest hit ren zeping of evergrande estimates that the restaurant tourism and movie industries lost 1 trillion yuan 143 3 billion of revenue during the first seven days of the spring festival holiday this year many of these businesses have very small profit margins and difficulty accessing capital plus they have to keep paying rent and workers even if they are closed many of them could go out of business to help these businesses the china banking and insurance regulatory commission said that banks and insurers should allow them to delay repaying mortgage loans and credit cards the people s bank of china the central bank announced that abundant liquidity will be made available the theory of decision making provides insights into the dilemmas that officials face when confronted with a potentially catastrophic but highly uncertain event historian and nuclear strategist roberta wohlstetter s 1962 book pearl harbor warning and decision about the dec 7 1941 japanese surprise attack on the us pacific fleet is fundamental to this decision analysis of course american planners were aware that the us fleet was very vulnerable when docked but they also knew that the ships needed lots of maintenance time in port in order to function putting the fleet out to sea would both lower the readiness of the ships and would be very expensive so the us navy could not leave pearl harbor every time there was a radar blip or other warning of a possible japanese attack wohlstetter introduced the concept of the cost of responding to ambiguous warning she found that there were of course lots of warning signals that a japanese attack might be underway on the morning of dec 7 but there had been lots of warning signals on many days in the preceding years it simply cost too much to respond to each of these ambiguous warnings that something might happen after the attack it was possible to go back and find warning signs that might have given leaders the information they needed to save the ships leaders were blamed for not spotting or acting on this information but wohlstetter showed that they acted responsibly given the real warning they had and the cost of acting too rashly they would have been severely criticized if they had repeatedly fled the harbor when no attack actually happened obviously if any individuals are proven to have acted corruptly or in dereliction of duty they should be punished in accordance with the law by the way wohlstetter s work is a great classic it is one of the few books i re read regularly anyone interested in decision making should read it her analysis applies to the response to the wuhan virus many potentially threatening health threats show up each year most of which turn out not to be too serious policymakers have to respond to these ambiguous warnings in a reasonable way given the information they have at the time quarantining a whole large city is a step that has not been taken elsewhere in modern history look at other recent epidemics the hiv virus that causes aids spread rapidly in the us and then around the world tragically it has caused mass deaths in sub saharan africa yet it might have been stopped by early quarantine of a small number of people similarly the epidemic of people taking opioids in the us soared out of control in the last decade but the us government did not take effective action to prevent it largely because doing so would have threatened the profits of a few pharmaceutical companies disgustingly some pundits are trying to score cheap political points on the basis of the coronavirus the kindest interpretation is that they are ignorant of history and of decision making theory more likely they are simply dishonest in contrast tedros ghebreyesus director general of the who said on jan 30 over the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response the speed with which china detected the outbreak isolated the virus sequenced the genome and shared it with who and the world are very impressive and beyond words so is china s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries in many ways china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response it s not an exaggeration the rapid and decisive action taken by chinese government officials in response to ambiguous information about the new coronavirus is frankly astonishing the whole world should be praying that these policies are effective and that few additional lives are lost

vulnerable when docked but they also knew that the ships needed lots of maintenance time in port in order to function putting the fleet out to sea would both lower the readiness of the ships and would be very expensive so the us navy could not leave pearl harbor every time there was a radar blip or other warning of a possible japanese attack wohlstetter introduced the concept of the cost of responding to ambiguous warning she found that there were of course lots of warning signals that a japanese attack might be underway on the morning of dec 7 but there had been lots of warning signals on many days in the preceding years it simply cost too much to respond to each of these ambiguous warnings that something might happen after the attack it was possible to go back and find warning signs that might have given leaders the information they needed to save the ships leaders were blamed for not spotting or acting on this information but wohlstetter showed that they acted responsibly given the real warning they had and the cost of acting too rashly they would have been severely criticized if they had repeatedly fled the harbor when no attack actually happened obviously if any individuals are proven to have acted corruptly or in dereliction of duty they should be punished in accordance with the law by the way wohlstetter s work is a great classic it is one of the few books i re read regularly anyone interested in decision making should read it her analysis applies to the response to the wuhan virus many potentially threatening health threats show up each year most of which turn out not to be too serious policymakers have to respond to these ambiguous warnings in a reasonable way given the information they have at the time quarantining a whole large city is a step that has not been taken elsewhere in modern history look at other recent epidemics the hiv virus that causes aids spread rapidly in the us and then around the world tragically it has caused mass deaths in sub saharan africa yet it might have been stopped by early quarantine of a small number of people similarly the epidemic of people taking opioids in the us soared out of control in the last decade but the us government did not take effective action to prevent it largely because doing so would have threatened the profits of a few pharmaceutical companies disgustingly some pundits are trying to score cheap political points on the basis of the coronavirus the kindest interpretation is that they are ignorant of history and of decision making theory more likely they are simply dishonest in contrast tedros ghebreyesus director general of the who said on jan 30 over the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response the speed with which china detected the outbreak isolated the virus sequenced the genome and shared it with who and the world are very impressive and beyond words so is china s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries in many ways china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response it s not an exaggeration the rapid and decisive action taken by chinese government officials in response to ambiguous information about the new coronavirus is frankly astonishing the whole world should be praying that these policies are effective and that few additional lives are lost
blackrock s kurt reiman said he was maintaining a neutral view on us stocks pointing to rising uncertainty around the us election and profit margin erosion typically seen in the late cycle periods analysts currently expect us earnings to grow about 9 in 2020 a hair lower than the typical range for the start of the year blackrock s senior strategist for north america said in a blog post yet we see that as an ambitious goal given potential for rising wages and other cost increases to further compress corporate margins our analysis of us corporate profit margins over the stages of the business cycle since 1965 showed that profit margins have tended to contract in late cycle periods high earnings expectations combined with these late cycle dynamics and more attractive valuations in

previous year cnx organically added 1 648 bcfe of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries which resulted in the company replacing over 300 of its 2019 net production of 539 bcfe these extensions and discoveries were a result of our continued development within the marcellus and utica shale formations in 2019 drilling and completion costs incurred directly attributable to extensions and discoveries were 630 million when divided by the extensions and discoveries of 1 648 bcfe this yields a drill bit f d cost of 0 38 per mcfe future development costs for proved undeveloped reserves

cai meng china daily in addition to the human suffering due to lost lives and illness the coronavirus is disrupting the chinese economy in the last few weeks daily life has been disrupted many businesses are closed and many people have lost income in particular many small businesses especially in service sectors will lose a big chunk of their revenue and possibly go bankrupt but experience from past epidemics shows that the nationwide aggregate effects in the long and short terms are likely to be limited the chinese government is taking historically unprecedented steps to limit the spread of the virus and in my view has done so astonishingly rapidly responsible governments and people around the world should be supporting these efforts experts emphasized that china has the macroeconomic policy tools needed to manage the situation kristalina georgieva managing director and chairman of the executive board of the international monetary fund said on feb 3 we support china s efforts to respond including recent fiscal monetary and financial actions we are confident that china s economy remains resilient and the world bank issued a statement supporting china s monetary policy the chinese authorities have policy space to respond and have announced a sizeable injection of liquidity which should help mitigate the costs to economic growth for all chinese and for foreigners living in china the last few weeks have been frightening but the supply of daily necessities has not been interrupted for most people the government s ability to keep supplies flowing into quarantined wuhan has been amazing the soldiers and transport workers who make this possible at the risk of their own lives should be highly praised i m especially moved to see many healthcare workers from all around china heroically going to wuhan although people are scared because of the possibility of evolution and spread of the coronavirus it is important to put it into perspective for example 80 000 people died from the h1n1 flu in the 2018 2019 winter in the united states alone so far flu has killed 10 000 this winter in the us the us center for disease control and prevention expects between 12 000 and 61 000 flu deaths each year in the us no one argues that these deaths are caused by us government inaction a 2017 study published in the lancet estimated that between 291 000 and 646 000 people worldwide die annually from the flu and the world health organization estimates that about 1 4 million people die each year in traffic worldwide with roughly half of those deaths caused by drunk drivers the coronavirus is very serious but even the worst case predictions show much less death and injury than these recurring dangers since we don t yet know how long the coronavirus epidemic will last or how widespread it will be estimates of the impact vary widely on the pessimistic side ren zeping chief economist and director of the evergrande think tank expects the economy to slow to 5 4 percent growth in 2020 his worst case scenario calculates that growth could slow to 5 percent as reported by caixin an independent chinese financial publication on the optimistic side wei shangjin professor at columbia business school and former chief economist of the asian development bank told caixin that he estimates a decline of 0 1 percentage point of growth even in the worst case these aggregate numbers show relatively healthy growth for the overall chinese economy in 2020 however microeconomic impacts in some sectors could be more severe especially since china is a key participant in the global economy imf spokesman gerry rice said if global supply chains were systematically affected or global financial markets were significantly impacted by increasing uncertainty then obviously the impact would be greater the slowdown will affect not only china for example goldman sachs estimates that the coronavirus will reduce the us annualized growth rate by 0 4 percentage point in the first quarter within china small businesses will be the hardest hit ren zeping of evergrande estimates that the restaurant tourism and movie industries lost 1 trillion yuan 143 3 billion of revenue during the first seven days of the spring festival holiday this year many of these businesses have very small profit margins and difficulty accessing capital plus they have to keep paying rent and workers even if they are closed many of them could go out of business to help these businesses the china banking and insurance regulatory commission said that banks and insurers should allow them to delay repaying mortgage loans and credit cards the people s bank of china the central bank announced that abundant liquidity will be made available the theory of decision making provides

individuals are proven to have acted corruptly or in dereliction of duty they should be punished in accordance with the law by the way wohlstetter s work is a great classic it is one of the few books i re read regularly anyone interested in decision making should read it her analysis applies to the response to the wuhan virus many potentially threatening health threats show up each year most of which turn out not to be too serious policymakers have to respond to these ambiguous warnings in a reasonable way given the information they have at the time quarantining a whole large city is a step that has not been taken elsewhere in modern history look at other recent epidemics the hiv virus that causes aids spread rapidly in the us and then around the world tragically it has caused mass deaths in sub saharan africa yet it might have been stopped by early quarantine of a small number of people similarly the epidemic of people taking opioids in the us soared out of control in the last decade but the us government did not take effective action to prevent it largely because doing so would have threatened the profits of a few pharmaceutical companies disgustingly some pundits are trying to score cheap political points on the basis of the coronavirus the kindest interpretation is that they are ignorant of history and of decision making theory more likely they are simply dishonest in contrast tedros ghebreyesus director general of the who said on jan 30 over the past few weeks we have witnessed the emergence of a previously unknown pathogen which has escalated into an unprecedented outbreak and which has been met by an unprecedented response the speed with which china detected the outbreak isolated the virus sequenced the genome and shared it with who and the world are very impressive and beyond words so is china s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries in many ways china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response it s not an exaggeration the rapid and decisive action taken by chinese government officials in response to ambiguous information about the new coronavirus is frankly astonishing the whole world should be praying that these policies are effective and that few additional lives are lost

how should long term investors interpret international economic organizations downgrading their economic forecasts the international monetary fund imf recently reduced its forecast for global gross domestic product growth by 0 2 percentage point to 3 0 for 2019 and by 0 1 percentage point to 3 4 for 2020 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd likewise lowered its official estimates reducing its 2019 outlook by 0 3 percentage point to 2 9 and 2020 by 0 4 percentage point to 3 0 but to ken fisher trades portfolio fisher investments founder and executive chairman this is noise for investors we agree reacting to such forecasts and revisions could easily be an error for one forecasts are opinions not guaranteed outcomes second even if either forecast proves correct we don t think it should be a problem for global stocks just as we doubt revising forecasts higher would be massively bullish projecting growth rates to the decimal point implies a great deal of math and precision but upon deeper consideration the endeavor seems grounded much more in opinion than science predicting global gdp growth involves numerous assumptions about each underlying country accuracy of the forecast hinges on all of the predicted events not only happening but having the exact impact the forecaster expected the notion that anyone could get all of this right for something as vast and varied as the global economy strikes us as exceedingly far fetched the vast number of factors and assumptions required to predict growth in the entire global economy makes repeated accuracy unlikely the oecd s outlook presumes its estimate of headwinds from trade tensions persist it also suggests manufacturing s woes continue weighing on labor markets income and spending it further references september s spike in oil prices increasing uncertainty but prices have since quickly retreated even if they rise anew as ken fisher wrote in august this isn t the 1970s as he showed the world has abundant oil supply and is far more energy efficient than it was decades ago the imf makes similar assumptions regarding oil prices inflation and trade among other variables a lot of this relies on mathematical models which reduce economies to math equations with a series of variables change one run it through the model and the result is a changed forecast in our view this invites trouble for a few reasons most models rely on historical data and long term averages which may or may not resemble the future they also presume relationships that may or may not hold markets and economies adapt to changing incentives regardless of how accurately they assess causal relationships models can t account for changes that might happen in the future finally the underlying presumptions about whether variables like higher oil prices or lower interest rates are harmful or helpful may not square with reality which is too complex to boil down to simple if then relationships inaccurate historical forecasts illustrate the point in april 2008 the imf expected 3 7 global growth that year and 3 8 for 2009 yet gdp grew just 1 9 in 2008 and declined 1 7 in 2009 in april 2009 the imf expected a lukewarm recovery in 2010 1 9 growth that was far short of 2010 s actual 4 3 growth rate more recently as late as october 2018 the imf predicted global growth of 3 7 for the full year yet global gdp grew 3 0 in 2018 we don t point this out to pick on them but rather to show the exercise s general futility even if their estimates are correct rather than being something to fear we think they present reasons for optimism in this case the oecd predicts brexit potentially causes a uk recession in 2020 if a no deal exit occurs which it envisions also reducing growth in europe considerably with regard to tariffs it suggests they are endangering future growth prospects there is no way to know if these views are too optimistic or pessimistic but it is noteworthy that despite these supposedly major headwinds they still predict global gdp growth this underscores our long running opinion that these issues aren t big or geographically sweeping enough to cause a global recession consider as ken fisher trades portfolio wrote in a recent independent column published in ireland tariffs threatened or enacted total just 0 3pc of our 78trn global gdp nowhere near large enough to render recession ebbs and flows in growth rates are typical in any economic expansion they don t dictate stocks direction should this prove to be simply a slowdown and not a recession in the offing we think that would positively surprise many investors that is a bullish factor in our view absolute growth rates matter much less than how economic and political drivers square with investors expectations in our view there is another large reason these forecasts aren t actionable for investors markets price in all widely known information including opinions and forecasts such as these this means that stock prices likely already reflect these expectations and the many many other forecasts swirling throughout financial news we don t think any will be a material driver for markets they may influence investors expectations to a degree but that is about the extent of their impact investing in stock markets involves the risk of loss and there is no guarantee that all or any capital

economic statecraft by obadiah mailafia 08170000411 sms only the tortoise and the palm tree are not known to be friends tall and elegant palm trees can grow to a height of 200 feet 61 96 metres in the andean mountains of latin america crafty and wise according to traditional folklore the tortoise is a small hunch backed animal that moves very slowly unless the palm wine tapper decides to carry one in his bag the tortoise is never going to be able to scale the summit of a palm tree and to behold the frightful wonder of god s universe from that peak i find this metaphor of the tortoise and the palm tree a fitting illustration for the painfully slow pace of economic growth in nigeria the palm tree is the ideal we should be aiming for in terms of economic development unfortunately our economy continues to grow at the pace of the proverbial tortoise it is saddled with too many binding constraints the slow pace of movement is such that given current path dependencies we are never likely to reach the summits in the foreseeable future looking back the period from 2000 to 2014 were the golden years when annual economic growth averaged an impressive seven per cent with the collapse of the global oil market coupled with domestic production bottlenecks and rising geopolitical uncertainty the economy shrunk precipitately in 2015 economic output fell to 2 7 per cent negative growth a phenomenon never witnessed since the civil war in 1968 occurred as 1 6 per cent growth was registered in 2016 things improved to 1 0 per cent as growth was recorded in that year the economy grew by 1 9 per cent in 2018 while in 2019 climbing up moderately to 2 3 per cent according to the world bank sadly the same world bank forecasts that the tortoise like pace of economic growth will persist in the coming years with a projected 2 5 per cent in 2020 and 2 7 per cent in 2021 according to the influential london based economist newspaper severe instability interventionism and corruption will be major obstacles to economic development over 2020 24 given the long term trends the tortoise will never see the head of the palm tree this is so because our population is growing annually by an average of 2 54 per cent while average annual growth continues to trail population in practical terms what this means is that every year the number of the poor in our country will continue to increase poverty will get worse and worse when you put into the equation a government that thrives on impunity nepotism and incompetence a regime that implicitly shares the vision and spirit of the global jihadists then we are in for a big trouble i have been told that such regimes thrive on economic collapse because economic prosperity gives the middle class enough comfort to rebel whereas people at point zero they rightly calculate will be preoccupied with how to survive this downward secular spiral is bound to implode eventually leading to an inevitable catastrophe i speak not as a pessimistic alarmist but as a lover of peace and a lover of democracy and economic freedom for the non economists among my gentle readers a few elaborations may be necessary economic growth refers to the quantitative output of the productive income over time these days growth is always analysed within the context of sustainable transformation by sustainable development we are referring to transformations that meet the needs of the present without compromising the welfare of future generations and the balance of the biosphere in our day and age growth is not synonymous with development growth refers to structural transformation that enhances livelihoods and higher quality of life sustained growth levels are good for the economy because they put the national production system in full throttle generating higher incomes and boosting aggregate demand lower levels of growth on the other hand can lead to goods deflation industrial layoffs labour surpluses and higher levels of unemployment higher public sector debt and general feelings of hopelessness growth and development are of course intertwined it is inconceivable that human development could be achieved without significant and sustained increases in output growth but this is not to say that growth will automatically usher in development many years ago it used to be said in brazil that the economy is doing well but the people are not this phenomenon of growth without development is particularly pronounced in nigeria some years ago the world bank published a country report on nigeria that characterised our development trajectory as one of jobless growth although we are officially out of recession the misery index for nigerians appears to be reaching despair levels growing insecurity across the country deepening poverty polarising inequalities and rising unemployment are creating widespread despondency related news in our day and age sustainable growth must be seen as an inseparable part of human development human security is a vital component of human development in addition to empowerment of women and the youth governments that know what they are doing make conscious and deliberate efforts to channel growth processes in a manner that serves the goals of sustainable human development and human security policies must be built to ensure sustainable harnessing of natural resources through technology choices that protect the environment and optimise natural resource utilisation for present and future generations within an eco system that promotes creativity entrepreneurship peace and social justice thinking of equity in sustainable growth requires us to focus on three forms of equity vertical equity which refers to the relationship between the rich and the poor and across the various segments and classes of society horizontal equity which seeks to improve the relations between various groups and regions within a country and intergenerational equity which refers to the obligation of present generations to utilise the country s national patrimony and in a manner that leaves something for future generations the cambridge economist partha dasgupta refers to it as natural capital defined as those assets of nature that can be directly consumed or indirectly deployed in the production of other goods and services countries such as norway qatar and the uae have led the way in evolving approaches that enhance the environment while promoting the security of future generations they also operate sovereign wealth funds running into trillions of dollars nigeria s sovereign wealth fund by contrast has a low asset base of 2 15bn a few years ago the commission on growth headed by nobel laureate michael spence completed its work according to spence the most successful countries are those that are hooked on to the integrated global economy such countries also tap into the knowledge economy and are particularly strong on human capital in addition they enjoy macroeconomic stability they tend to also possess a high level of savings while also being oriented towards heavy investments in terms of both public and private investments successful growth countries also implement effective strategies for rapid structural diversification and continuing structural transformation growth driven countries also provide effective market incentives while maintaining flexible labour markets the quality of political leadership is vital their ability to make strategic choices while articulating a coherent growth strategy and communicating effectively a shared vision for political buy in are critical leaders of high growth countries also have to maintain a persistent determined focus on the goal of inclusive long term growth build consensus among stakeholders and create pragmatic effective and when needed activist government over time crucially important is understanding and respect for markets price signals decentralisation and private sector investment this must go hand in hand with institutional reforms that foster effective regulation while promoting effective delivery and upholding moral norms and public ethics the government must be seen to be fair and inclusive while promoting a society based on the rule of law a society that nurtures a progressive eco system that allows the energy and creativity of the youths to flourish to be

last october ecuador witnessed some of the largest mass protests in its modern history concentrated mainly in the capital city of quito and less intensely in guayaquil cuenca and portoviejo the protests ignited on october 3 when president lenin moreno s government announced the elimination of long standing fuel subsidies for gasoline and natural gas the cancellation of these subsidies provoked a major increase in prices and overturned a national welfare program that had been in place since the 1970s at an average annual cost of 1 3 billion this fiscal measure was part of public spending cuts that moreno s administration had negotiated with the international monetary fund imf in return for a loan that would allow ecuador to borrow 4 2 billion over three years in recent weeks moreno held a meeting with the imf in davos in order to discuss the loan terms and review the relationship between the country and the organization by eliminating the fuel subsidies which are no longer affordable the ecuadorian economy expected to ease its debt burden and reduce the fiscal deficit incremented during previous administrations nonetheless the fuel subsidies are only one component of the so called package of economic and labor reforms that lenin moreno pretended to implement in order to obtain imf funds the reforms also include labor reform and pension adjustments the government buckles in previous decades ecuador witnessed the dramatic end of more than one presidential tenure in 2000 jamil mahuad elected in 1998 and responsible for the dollarization of the country was ousted when the armed forces withdrew their support and mass protest engulfed the country similarly lucio gutierrez democratically elected in 2002 was displaced in 2005 due to unpopular political measures that devolved into mass protests it should therefore come as no surprise that president moreno was overly cautious in responding to the 2019 mobilization which included provisionally moving the seat of his government out of quito to the city of guayaquil moreno s predecessor and former political ally rafael correa also had to deal with major public discontent the social spark that started with the withdrawal of fuel subsidies quickly turned into a long list of grievances ranging from indigenous rights and rural reform to corruption and social welfare ultimately the moreno administration backtracked on its elimination of the fuel subsidy and announced that it would seek alternative ways to overcome the budget deficit once the demonstrations subsided toward the end of 2019 following a compromise with the protesters president moreno appointed new officers to the country s top military posts after allegations that the armed forces had abused the curfew in order to suppress public dissent a structural issue currently ecuador s socioeconomic predicament is due mainly to its historic reliance on income from fossil fuels and other commodities as well as the failure of previous administrations to maintain a rainy day fund during times of economic boom additionally the protests have had a severe economic impact similar to chile s case having brought the country to a standstill until the un and the catholic church stepped in to broker an agreement moving forward president moreno will need a new strategy that is more gradual and less socially traumatic to pursue macroeconomic and fiscal reform simultaneously the government needs to enact institutional changes to facilitate a leaner administration and reshape the national economic model to reduce its dependency on the export of commodities lastly ecuador needs to comprehensively address the issue of the more than 250 000 venezuelan migrants now living within its borders putting a strain on the small nation s economy the global reduction in commodity prices coupled with the onerous social spending programs that moreno inherited has created a fiscal conundrum that his government is tasked with solving correa s opposition underlying the social and economic issues moreno faces is a strong political tension within ecuador the rift is between the president s right wing supporters including the country s economic elites and on the other hand the partisans and supporters of former president rafael correa in office between 2007 and 2017 who is still very popular with constituents both in and outside the country having served as correa s vice president between 2007 and 2013 moreno was elected to the presidency as the heir of correa s left wing progressive agenda however shortly after his ascension to the presidency moreno broke with the correista agenda and nowadays moreno and correa exchange nothing but blows at the end of 2019 ecuador s national court of justice ratified the preventive detention against correa s ally and former vice president jorge glas on charges of alleged bribery illicit association and influence peddling correa himself who has settled in belgium since leaving office has been charged by ecuador s judiciary with similar crimes and misdemeanors the former president and his numerous allies denounce the charges as political prosecution and write lenin moreno off as a traitor who deceived ecuador by running his campaign under the correa brand but who governs as a right wing technocrat for his part moreno also denounces the influence of correa and his pink tide allies in the region including venezuelan president nicolas maduro have in the protests and other plots that have disrupted his administration and cost millions of dollars for the commerce and transportation industries as ecuador prepares for presidential elections in february 2021 right wing figures like jaime nebot and guillermo lasso are seeking to return the country toward proper conservative and market friendly governance however these traditional right wing parties are finding that lenin moreno has shifted to occupy the center right of the political spectrum and already incarnates many of the policies that the right champions simultaneously serious mobilization and debate are ongoing among ecuador s populist and progressive parties including talks of rafael correa s potential return from exile as ecuador celebrates 20 years since it adopted the us dollar as its official currency the country s economy and its relationship with the united states and organizations like the imf remain contentious issues that will mark its political future during the upcoming year the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily

the state of the economy is going to be important for the presidential election coming up although it may not be quite as important as president trump sees it calling for a referendum on the economy right now the economy is not setting any records as far as growth is concerned and in fact is actually growing by far less than the president or for that matter almost anyone would like it to grow u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin has just announced that u s officials are expecting that the economy may grow by less than 3 0 percent this year two other government projections expect an even lower outcome for the year the congressional budget office for example is expecting that the us economy will grow by only 2 2 percent in 2020 the federal reserve√¢ s outlook is for an even slower growth 2 0 percent the general mode in terms of real gdp growth is that the economy is facing the fact that the world economy is slowing the chinese virus has been spreading and brexit still has to be defined and executed the president would like to call for a vote on the economy because things seem to be doing well actually a lot better than they initially look when just scanning the macro economic numbers on the aggregate economy and the rest of the world doesn t look so good when one digs below the surface of the aggregate numbers one finds that the u s economy is doing well in terms of wealth creation the stock market keeps hitting new historical highs it doesn√¢ t seem to want to stop and one can make the argument as i have in many posts that the stock market can continue to hit new highs in this calendar year of 2020 secondly the unemployment rate remains around 3 6 percent near the fifty year low of 3 5 percent and by all indications √¢ wages seem to be picking up for a wide range of workers not for just the highest paid √¢ i believe that the unemployment rate will remain low that in 2020 we will continue to work on the labor force participation rate and efforts will be made to actually get more marginal participants in the labor market more fully engaged this is a condition of the changing nature of the job market and the continued decline in the role that manufacturing plays in the current economy in addition inflation continues to remain low and both the congressional budget office and the federal reserve are picturing an inflation rate in the near future of less than 2 0 percent per year the inflationary expectations built into government bond yields remain around 1 7 percent again the changes we are seeing in the makeup of the economy have led to money and credit going into non industrial uses where financial engineering is in vogue and where consumer and wholesale prices are not directly impacted the us dollar remains strong and is expected to stay strong or get even stronger during the year although investment in physical capital has not shown much strength in the current period of economic expansion investment in intellectual capital remains at an all time high and is expected to remain near these levels into the foreseeable future with the shift in the economy away from manufacturing and toward services and networks investments in large physical capital projects will not be as pronounced however consumer spending also remains strong and is expected to continue driving the spending going on in the economy looking around at many of the micro segments of the economy one sees lots of activity and lots of innovation and creativity but unless there is a major breakdown in some area of the economy or in some area of the world it is hard to see any bad news about almost anything economically related in the next nine months as greg ip writes in the wall street journal although president trump has taken credit for many of these √¢ trends√¢ in the economy most if not all of them began before he took office but one could argue that these √¢ trends√¢ have continued not because of what mr trump has done but they have continued because of what mr trump has not done and in this case doing little or nothing seems to have been exactly the right thing to do the major piece of economic legislation achieved during the administration of mr trump was the tax reform bill passed by the us congress in december 2017 otherwise most of what mr trump has done is to relax rules and regulations most economists argue as i do that the tax reform bill did very little to stimulate the economy and could almost be marked down as having made very little difference in how things proceeded through 2018 and 2019 estimates have indicated that almost two thirds of the benefits of the tax reform bill were used by companies to buy back their own stock not bad for the stock market not so good for investment in physical capital by corporations as a result as i have constantly argued the economy has been driven by the supply side and not by aggregate demand therefore productivity growth has been the force increasing the aggregate real gross domestic product and this process has been the primary reason why economic growth has been so slow this century the growth of labor productivity has just not been that robust growth has been steady it has been persistent and it has continued making this period of economic expansion the longest in united states history it has also contributed to all the micro pluses that i mentioned above the transformations that have taken place in the economy over the past twenty years or more have been very positive for the economy it is just that we are still measuring economic activity in an old out dated manner we need to revise our statistics in order to better understand what is fully going on in the economy but this transformation has been a very beneficial one for shareholders and if it continues through 2020 stocks should continue to hold on to their new historic highs or might even attain some new ones the economy will continue to grow wealth will continue to rise unemployment will remain low and policy makers both in terms of monetary policy and fiscal policy will not have to make any severe moves that could possibly disrupt the economy oh there may be some things that this administration could do to build up and strengthen the economy infrastructure spending could be a real plus further advances in education and life time learning could also help to build the workforce and could help to raise the labor force participation rate efforts could also be made to incrementally and patiently reduce the federal debt and even more encouragement could also be given to further build intellectual capital but these are long term efforts to build economic momentum and not short run fixes aimed at boosting up short term growth rates the bottom line is that the economy really seems to be performing very well unless there is some market collapse somewhere during the year the u s economy should sail through the election in pretty good shape this seems to be what mr trump is hoping for and investors should really like this environment

disrupted yet here too investors are taking a panglossian view that chinese authorities will be able to contain the virus and send half the country s population that is now under quarantine back to

as we move through a new year and new decade what will 2020 bring for business in jamaica more of the same or something different let me admit up front i do not hold or pretend to hold any special powers to predict the future i wish i did and who wouldn t but sorry i don t all i can do much like anyone else is make a best guess but not a best guess based on feeling or best wishes but on data analysis known and immerging patterns and connecting the dots so let s do just that for 2020 last year saw jamaica further improve its macro economic stability with the indicators pointing in the right direction but what of economic growth as finance minister dr nigel clarke and others have acknowledged while macro economic stability is a critical condition for economic growth by itself it is not enough to spur greater levels of economic growth and the results speak for themselves headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters the jamaican economy grew according to the statistical institute of jamaica statin at a low 0 6 per cent for the june to september quarter of 2019 the last reported period of 2019 this makes for 19 consecutive quarters of economic growth which is the longest unbroken stretch of economic growth since jamaica started measuring growth quarterly in 1997 this growth while low did occur under challenging circumstances locally and internationally for example locally we saw the closure of the jisco alpart plant represented a 17 6 per cent decline in jamaica s output of bauxite alumina and internationally the trade war between the united states and china saw a drag on global growth so what will change this picture for jamaica what guided the list i chose the list based on several factors including but not limited to the convergence of various government policy investments enhanced and emerging business opportunities and infrastructural decisions made by the government private sector and civil society in 2019 and preceding years certain patterns have emerged that should make 2020 best guess a very special one for business in jamaica top 10 business trends here are my top 10 trends placed in no order of priority 1 jamaica stock exchange the number one ranked stock exchange according to bloomberg in 2018 will continue its stellar performance with even more initial public offering ipos and additional public offerings apos the money raised will further fuel the expansion of businesses locally and offer jamaicans an opportunity to invest the government through the listing of transjamaica highway and jps will continue its policy as it did with wigton ipo where over 30 000 jamaicans participated 2 tourism growth the preliminary report from the jamaica tourist board jtb is showing that in 2019 tourism earned between us 3 7 billion and us 3 8 billion from approximately 4 4 million visitors which is a us 500 million increase from 2018 this success was underscored by an increase in the retention of tourist spend locally from us30 cents in 2016 to us40 8 cents in 2019 the retention earnings are set to improve with greater linkages between tourism and local attractions entertainment and food events 3 special economic zones special economic zones sez a geographically designated area where fiscal and other incentives are used to attract investment to a country are expanding globally there are more than 5 400 sezs in over 147 countries including jamaica after the mammoth task undertaken in 2019 by the special economic zone authority jseza of transitioning jamaica s freezones over to sez we now have approximately 104 entities across 140 locations in 11 parishes with sez status as either developers or occupants while the sez are frequently associated with the business process outsourcing bpo sector bpo while an important sector is but one of a variety of economic activities undertaken in the sezs in 2020 expect greater growth in the bpo logistics manufacturing and creative industries with expanded opportunities for non sez local businesses through stronger linkages and higher domestic inputs being sourced from the local economy additionally sezs will experience growth in jamaica by introducing new business models reflective opportunities presented by global value chains in the as a service model for example research as a service data as a service distribution as a service etc we already see sez companies like canco limited in st thomas with its food manufacturing standards certifications leading the way by offering manufacturing as a service likewise a subsidiary of west indies petroleum offering oil storage as a service in port esquivel 4 further bpo growth the bpo sector has unquestionably been one of the best performing in 2019 the sector is currently undergoing a transformation moving into greater value added and knowledge intensive activities according to the business process industry association of jamaica bpiaj now the global services association of jamaica gsaj the sector employs approximately 36 000 jamaicans and is segmented with 80 per cent customer service 18 per cent knowledge process and two per cent information technology outsourcing 5 the ferry economic cluster buildout a cluster is emerging in the ferry st catherine area that most people have not fully recognised the power of at least not yet the 94 acre kingston 876 commercial complex is being built out by the cascade group jamaica and includes the 60 million headquarters for tropical battery the current build out of ceac outsourcing company limited s ceac 100 000 square feet bpo focused sez and the already built 7 000 square metre nestl√© jamaica distribution hub when completed kingston 876 is expected to host 30 35 operations the ferry area also hosts tank weld equipment ltd the sole dealer for shacman trucks for the caribbean derrimon trading is leasing space from tank weld to build out a 100 million distribution hub what makes the ferry so special its location it is close to the port of kingston three major population centres kingston portmore and spanish town and it has great connectivity to both the east west and north south highways 6 improved road network it goes without saying that roads are important to economic development nevertheless roads by themselves do not induce sustainable growth however roads that facilitate the movement of goods services and or people more efficiently not only introduce cost savings but new opportunities for earnings and these are the conditions that many of the more than 400 roads that were resurfaced and rehabilitated in 2019 offer jamaica the prime minister said it best at the ground breaking for the southern coastal highway improvement project reducing the distance between people market services and knowledge is a great part of what economic growth is all about the flow of goods capital technology and people will drive economic growth and create a broader space for development and prosperity for all 7 drones the global commercial drone market is estimated at a value of us 5 80 billion and is projected to grow tenfold in five years by barclays this is a fourth industrial revolution technology that has tremendous job creation prospects in jamaica the more immediate opportunities will be seen in various services industries in 2020 expect drone usage to expand into construction private security precision agriculture to deliver fertiliser herbicides and pesticides the most exciting opportunity will be in tourism with drone flying as a service where tourists can fly around the beautiful landscape of jamaica and take pictures and videos this is a winning formula to enhance jamaican tourism in the 21st century the great thing about drone flying as a service is that it represents a low hanging fruit that locals can get involved in build the market and dominate 8 the bank of jamaica monetary transmission mechanism one of the perennial complaints of jamaican businesses especially the msme sector is access to credit at reasonable and affordable rates while there has been much improvement in this area for many msmes the interest rates being offered by financial institutions are still far too high in response the bank of jamaica boj undertook a set of policy rates the rates that financial institutions borrow from the boj reductions reaching 0 5 per cent by the end of 2019 the reductions were done to drive credit expansion by making money less expensive to borrow it has not fully worked as acknowledged by boj governor richard byles when he said that while this faster growth of private sector credit is a positive signal we are of the view that this expansion in credit is still not fast enough particularly in the context of where domestic activity remains below the economy s potential or capacity this suggests that an even faster pace of credit growth is possible without causing inflation to rise above the inflation target importantly the governor clearly signalled that the way forward would not be business as usual when he exclaimed that whatever blockage is in the system that is causing the rates to not go down as fast i want them to talk why we are not seeing a better transmission of the policy rate reductions to borrowers 9 lng the new 194 mw jamaica public service company ltd liquified natural gas lng plant and the new fortress lng terminal both in old harbour st catherine have changed jamaica s energy landscape forever the latter ought to be watched keenly because of its wider implications for development economic growth and job creation the terminal is part of larger plans to position jamaica as an lng hub within a global logistics and trade hub additionally it has opened opportunities for further economic diversification and investment in food processing industries cold logistics pharmaceuticals manufacturing of chemicals and plastics however the biggest thing to watch is in the possibility of a data centre by new fortress data centres are critical infrastructure in cloud computing where depending on its size and configuration tech companies like google apple microsoft etc perform or receive services ranging from data storage infrastructure as a service data as a service data analytics etc for data centres energy is their largest operating expense largely due to the cooling required for the computer servers jamaica offers a globally unique solution for data centres by combing a variety of technologies the potential combination of lng for power generation cryogenics lng is shipped at a very cold 160 c for cooling renewables such as solar wind and deep water cooling from the sea puts new fortress in a great position to put jamaica on the map in growing the data centre and cloud computing market estimated by bloomberg to be worth us 36 7 billion 10 logistics opening new possibilities with the improving road network improved port and airport infrastructure raising of money on the stock exchange by logistics companies and the build out of more warehouse space especially as sezs 2020 will be a year for logistics mailpac listed on the jamaica stock exchange in the latter part of 2019 raising money to fund its growth and expansion in response to the growing e commerce market in jamaica another example to watch is howard mitchell s aircraft cargo and handler provider ajas limited and its plans to list on the junior stock exchange in 2020 the funds raised according to mitchell would finance its expansion in response to keeping pace with increased passenger and cargo volumes additionally he pointed out that there is interest coming from the middle east about using jamaica as an aviation hub finally we cannot forget wisynco national baking company and knutsford express all of which either announced or commenced logistics projects in 2019 this sampling of private projects is the logistics hub in motion using the infrastructure laid down by the government and transforming jamaica into a logistics centred economy ainsley brown is the senior director regulations policy monitoring and enforcement at jamaica s special economic zone authority and an adjunct lecturer in logistics at the mona school of business and management
february 2020 rail news federal legislation regulation by julie sneider senior associate editor with 2020 being a presidential election year it wouldn t be farfetched to believe that no substantial bills on infrastructure will get through congress before lawmakers break for presidential campaign season later this year still folks in the rail realm who spend much of their time on capitol hill are cautiously optimistic about the potential for enacting key legislation one thing that may be raising their hopes is a significant legislative victory for railroads and rail suppliers that occurred in the final hours of 2019 the passage of a five year extension of the short line tax credit known by its tax line item reference section 45g in late december congress passed and president donald trump signed two major appropriations bills that included a number of measures of interest to the rail industry one of those bills h r 1865 included a measure that made the 45g tax credit retroactive to 2018 and effective through 2022 first enacted in 2005 the tax credit has helped short lines invest more than 4 billion in infrastructure rehabilitation projects extended by bipartisan votes on six occasions prior to the congressional action late last year the most recent extension expired at 2017 s end chuck baker aslrra american short line and regional railroad association aslrra president chuck baker says passage of this latest 45g extension was one of the better moments of his career as the association s president for the past year as well as in his previous leadership roles at the national railroad construction maintenance association nrc baker has spent a good portion of his career advocating for a long term if not permanent extension of 45g i m still over the moon about it baker says the passage of the 45g extension was a huge moment for us we ve been working so hard on this issue but aslrra and other rail groups that touted the extension including the nrc the railway supply institute rsi railway engineering maintenance suppliers association remsa and association of american railroads aar don t plan to rest on their legislative laurels they ll now turn their attention to pushing for a permanent extension of the tax credit possibly as part of legislation that will reauthorize the fixing america s surface transportation fast act which is set to expire sept 30 a wishlist for reauthorization overall surface transportation reauthorization is their top legislative agenda item on capitol hill this year rail industry advocates say and they re hopeful that fast act reauthorization will address several priorities aimed at strengthening the rail business we still have as a major priority a permanent or even longer term extension of the 45g tax credit baker says it s never been in the surface transportation bill before but frankly that s a place that makes a lot of sense for it it is a transportation bill with a whole lot of infrastructure investment and it has a tax title so it would be a great fit for us we ll certainly be going to our champions to suggest it jacob carter the tax credit extension is anticipated to drive 200 million per year in rail infrastructure spending says jacob carter who advocated for the tax credit as government affairs manager at remsa it s a really big legislative victory for the short line railroads and rail supply industry anytime you can inject more money in maintenance and operations carter says there s a great opportunity in surface transportation reauthorization to get 45g a permanent extension the 45g extension wasn t the only thing in last year s appropriations bills that made railroaders happy other measures in the legislation signed by trump included 325 million for the next round of fiscal year 2020 consolidated rail infrastructure and safety improvements crisi grants 1 billion for the next round of fiscal year 2020 grants in the better utilizing investments to leverage development build program which was formerly known as tiger and 2 5 million for the short line safety institute rail industry representatives hope to build on those legislative victories during the reauthorization process as well they re calling for continued federal investment in rail through programs such as crisi build federal state partnership for state of good repair restoration and enhancement capital investment grants cig and infrastructure for rebuilding america infra grants nicole brewin rsi and of course amtrak we have to make sure that it gets its reauthorization at the highest level of funding says nicole brewin rsi s vice president of government and public affairs additional items on rail association priority lists under a reauthorization bill include funding for transit and commuter rail agencies to maintain the positive train control ptc systems that they re federally mandated to implement by dec 31 and disaster recovery funding authorized for short lines which would help smaller railroads pay for infrastructure cleanup and restoration following natural disasters such as floods tornadoes and hurricanes balanced regs crossing safety topping aar s priority list for a surface transportation reauthorization bill is maintaining current balanced rate and service regulatory framework according to aar s website in addition aar officials want congress to consider several policy priorities with grade crossing safety and funding for the federal section 130 crossing program leading that wishlist the aar desires section 130 funding levels that are maintained at least at the current level which is 245 million for fy2020 under the federal highway administration s fhwa jurisdiction section 130 provides funding to projects that eliminate crossing hazards such projects have helped reduce the number of collisions at crossings by 36 percent since 2000 according to the aar adrian arnakis aar it s not an accident that we started our list with highway rail grade crossing safety which has been one of the harder nuts to crack says adrian arnakis aar s senior vice president of government affairs in addition aar leaders are recommending that congress increase incentive payments for crossing closures from the current 7 500 cap to 100 000 and expand flexibility in section 130 by allowing funding to be used for certain protective warning device replacements the aar also is calling for 3 million in federal dollars per year for operation lifesaver s crossing safety educational efforts in collaboration with the fhwa federal railroad administration fra and federal transit administration fta on the regulatory front leaders from the aar and other rail industry groups hope the reauthorization legislation will address modern technology as well as the federal permitting process required of railroads before they pursue infrastructure projects regarding new technology the fra s current regulatory approach doesn t necessarily accommodate innovations that railroads invest in to improve safety and efficiency says rsi s brewin adding that the rsi has formed a working group to evaluate fra regs that could be changed to reflect technological advances we re talking about track automation technologies inspection technologies things that can be done at crossings to improve safety or things that could be used on a train to make them smarter brewin says these technologies are new but not so new that they haven t been tested and developed but the fra s current regulations aren t written for those types of technology so we support modernizing our current regulatory code as for permitting reform rail advocates want congress to continue cutting red tape for infrastructure project approval and construction under federal laws while previous bills have called for streamlining the permitting process and president trump has issued executive orders to continue doing so more can be done to fast track routine maintenance and replacement construction projects without sacrificing environmental or historical preservation concerns aar officials say no to state owned enterprises meanwhile a policy topic that remains of interest to u s rail suppliers is the transit infrastructure vehicle security act tivsa which was passed last year as part of the national defense authorization bill tivsa prohibits federal funding for transit projects that involve the purchase of rail cars made by chinese state owned enterprises such as the crrc corp passenger rail car builders were very happy that tivsa passed says rsi s brewin still the association will continue to track the issue of state owned enterprises competing with private domestic companies that seek to bid on rail car contracts she says from an american rail supplier perspective we are willing to compete with anybody as long as it s fair brewin says but when you re competing against a government that s very difficult to do going into 2020 we ll be working with the fta on the implementation of tivsa as well as looking at what can be done in the freight space to make sure that china doesn t turn from transit to the freight rail supply marketplace rsi counterparts in europe have expressed concerns about chinese government backed enterprises making headway into europe s freight car market she says we ve met with several european trade associations and the first thing on everybody s mind is that china is here and is not making it easy to compete because they re able to subsidize their prices brewin says they make no bones about wanting to take over this market it s very concerning to european canadian and u s suppliers because these are manufacturing jobs that we re talking about while rail industry leaders have a lengthy lineup of policies they d like congress to consider this year they ve also got a handful of topics they don t want signed into law among them proposals to increase truck size and weight limits on national highways and bridges mandated operating models such as a minimum train crew size and mandates that would result in taking over property ownership of railroad right of way for utility or broadband access those issues are on our don t hurt us bucket list aar s arnakis says one question yet to be answered as rail industry constituents set their lobbying priorities will a surface reauthorization pass before the current law expires sept 30 rail advocates acknowledge two key factors timing and debates over financing that could get in the way the realists on capitol hill will say it s a presidential election year and it s going to be very very difficult to get the attention and time that s needed to get it all done by sept 30 says brewin noting that lawmakers will be off the hill more days than they ll be on it in 2020 legislation crawls forward that said there s been some action in the senate where the environment and public works committee in july 2019 passed a substantial highway infrastructure bill a five year 287 billion measure that presents a 27 percent increase from fast act levels brewin says that legislation would fund the repair and maintenance of roads and bridges expedite permitting processes for major infrastructure projects and help transportation systems become more resilient to the impact of climate change the highway bill still needs to be considered by the senate s commerce and banking committees which would add the rail and transit titles then the senate finance committee would need to figure out the financing on jan 29 the chairs of three house committees transportation and infrastructure t i energy and commerce and ways and means unveiled a framework for a five year 760 billion plan that would address some of the nation s most urgent infrastructure needs including those involving highways rail and transit systems airports ports and harbors wastewater and drinking water brownfields and broadband the proposal calls for an investment of 434 billion in surface transportation over five years including 105 billion for public transit and 55 billion for passenger rail according to the american public transportation association as of press time the t i committee had scheduled a jan 29 afternoon hearing on the package while the ways and means committee had scheduled a hearing on the same day to examine funding options main question who pays the biggest hurdle for both the house and senate to pass such legislation is figuring out how to pay for it especially when it comes to shoring up the highway trust fund htf rail advocates say the htf receives revenue from a federal fuel tax of 18 4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24 4 cents per gallon for diesel realistically there needs to be a compromise on raising the federal gas tax which congress hasn t raised since the early 1990s says remsa s carter raising taxes is a hard thing for to swallow aar leaders and other rail advocates are calling for a federal gas tax increase or the creation of a vehicle miles traveled fee or weight distance tax to help bolster the htf such measures would return the htf to a true user based fund aar officials say over the past 10 years the revenue generated by the tax hasn t fully covered the cost of the nation s transportation needs requiring a transfer of 144 billion in general funds to the htf according to the aar in the association s view that puts the rail sector at an unfair competitive disadvantage yet convincing congress to pass new taxes won t be easy even though 31 states and the district of columbia have enacted legislation that will or may increase state gas taxes so between the debate over surface transportation financing and the tight calendar leading up to presidential campaign season in the fall there s not much time for congress to push through a full reauthorization bill before sept 30 some rail advocates believe that compressed time frame makes it more likely that congress will pass a shorter term extension of the current fast act leaving it to the new congress to take up a long term reauthorization bill in spring 2021 says aslrra s baker but there will be a legitimate effort to write the legislation this year he says and i think they ll make a lot of progress on it besides surface transportation reauthorization there s another policy issue of high interest to the freight rail industry the state of u s trade negotiations in recent weeks congress passed the u s mexico canada agreement usmca considered an updated version of the north american free trade agreement on jan 29 president trump signed it the u s pact with canada and mexico will allow more goods and services to flow tariff free across the continent that s significant to the freight rail sector since 42 percent of carloads and intermodal units and 35 percent of annual revenue are directly associated with international trade according to the aar in addition about 50 000 rail jobs worth more than 5 5 billion in annual wages and benefits depend directly on international trade mexico has already ratified the usmca but canada had yet to do so as of press time also worrisome to rail advocates are the u s trade talks with china and recent trade tensions between the two nations in early january aar economists attributed last year s decline in north american rail traffic in part to the uncertainty over trade no question 2019 was a challenging year for rail traffic thanks mainly to the macroeconomy and continued years long changes in energy markets said aar senior vp john gray in a press release trade disputes and the general economic uncertainty they spawned harmed rail served industries much more than the overall economy since then president trump has signed phase 1 of a trade pact with china both actions have freight rail officials feeling hopeful that other lingering trade issues will be resolved this year says arnakis implementation of the usmca will be very important to us so we ll be following that very closely she adds despite concerns over trade and other policy questions rail advocates remain positive that some good things for the industry will come out of congress this year after all transportation infrastructure isn t a red state or blue state issue it s something politicians from both sides of the aisle like to talk about when they meet with their constituents capitol hill observers say and lawmakers won t want to return to their home districts this fall and tell voters that they weren t able to accomplish something big on transportation says arnakis members of congress still seem very very interested in getting something done email comments or questions to julie sneider tradepress com
limited impact on china s economy already many internationally renowned economic institutions have released preliminary estimates of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy on january 31 kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund imf reported that the novel coronavirus would have negative consequences on the performance of china s economy in the first quarter but that it is still premature to accurately gauge its impact before the end of the first quarter on january 21 in the world economic outlook report released in switzerland the imf revised china s 2020 growth forecast from 5 8 percent to 6 percent on february 3 the world bank and the imf said that the chinese government has the capability to manage the epidemic and that they are confident in the resilience and policy space of china s economy in a speech in paris on february 5 christine lagarde chief of the european central bank and former managing director of the imf said that while the threat of a trade war between china and the united states appears to have receded the coronavirus adds a new layer of uncertainty to the global landscape according to the research of epidemic economics epidemics can cause a severe negative impact on an economy in the short term but the impact is usually muted in the mid and long term this trend conforms to the forecast of wei shangjin former chief economist of the asian development bank he commented on january 28 that if the epidemic is contained by april it will exert only a limited impact on the chinese economy probably a 0 1 percentage point decrease in china s gdp this year the forecasts of major international economic organizations have been mostly consistent with those from the chinese government the impact of the epidemic on china s economy will be determined by the progress and effectiveness of prevention and control efforts and it still seems that the impact is episodic and temporary and won t change the general positive trend of the chinese economy in the long run when predicting the coronavirus impact on china s economy international institutions like the imf usually use the 2003 sars epidemic as a benchmark according to statistics released by the imf china s gdp grew by 10 percent in 2003 0 9 percentage points higher than in 2002 from 2003 to 2012 the annual growth rate of china s gdp averaged10 6 percent and the figure was 6 9 percent from 2013 to 2019 data released by the national bureau of statistics of china on january 17 showed that china s gdp reached nearly 100 trillion yuan us 14 3 trillion in 2019 with per capita gdp surpassing us 10 000 for the first time the annual gdp growth rate hit 6 1 percent in 2019 and the year on year growth in the first quarter of that year was 6 4 percent at current market prices china s gdp in the first quarter of 2019 accounted for 22 percent of the total of the year the share of the first quarters of the three years from 2016 to 2018 was 21 8 percent 21 9 percent and 22 percent respectively that means the fluctuations of gdp growth rate in the first quarter would create less impact compared to the other three quarters of the year if the epidemic is contained in the next few months and the chinese government introduces proactive economic policies thereafter the coronavirus outbreak will only leave a limited impact on china s economy mounting uncertainty in the world economy although the novel coronavirus outbreak could only cause a fleeting impact on china s economy any major fluctuation in the world s second large economy will significantly influence the global economy through supply and industrial chains china s share in the world economy had increased from 4 3 percent in 2003 to 16 3 percent in 2019 if evaluating the impact just based on china s economic aggregate in 2003 it s easy to fall into the trap of linear contrast in 2019 china s economic aggregate was about us 14 1 trillion in this context a 0 1 percentage point drop would result in a loss of more than us 14 billion given that china has become the world s largest goods trading country and contributes more than 30 percent of world economic growth the spillover effect of fluctuations in china s economy can t be underestimated for instance the novel coronavirus outbreak has caused a sharp contraction in china s transportation sector which led to a rapid drop in the country s demand for oil to address the situation the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec decided to reduce oil output today chinese tourists make more than 160 million outbound trips each year the coronavirus epidemic happened to break out during the spring festival holiday a peak time for outbound travel of chinese people from that angle the epidemic has exerted a major impact on tourism and civil aviation in china s neighboring countries which are popular destinations for chinese tourists according to statistics released by the japan association of travel agents 400 000 group travelers from china are expected to cancel planned trips to japan before march countries more dependent on tourism such as vietnam cambodian and thailand may suffer even greater losses but the most severe uncertainty is impact on the supply chain of the manufacturing sector according to the world development report 2020 released by the world bank a prominent feature of today s global economy is that intermediate goods account for 70 percent of the world s total trade which is more evident in east asian economies in the months to come the negative impact of the epidemic on countries such as japan south korea singapore vietnam and indonesia will grow considering their increasingly closer connections to china in fields like textiles and electronics countries like bangladesh and cambodia will also be affected wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak is a major automobile manufacturing base and many manufacturers in china have opted to remain idle in this context the global automobile industry will also suffer a heavy blow before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus china u s trade friction was affecting the global supply chain and some enterprises started moving their manufacturing bases from china to countries like those in southeast asia the epidemic has spread globally with confirmed cases reported in more than 20 countries and regions around the world developed countries are taking rigorous measures to strengthen quarantine inspection and some even cut off air transport with some regions of china however if countries around the world fail to make concerted efforts to stop the epidemic global trade in parts and components will suffer greater losses adding new levels of uncertainty to the 2020 global economy

washington president donald trump delivered his fourth budget to congress on monday and the message once again was chop chop chop except when it was spend spend spend the military and other programs that reflect trump s campaign priorities will get a considerable boost in spending while other domestic programs will see steep cuts education chop foreign aid chop the epa chop chop chop the trump administration often points out that hard working americans must make tough budget decisions every day and that the federal government is just like you struggling to make ends meet and forced to live within its means prep for the polls see who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our voter guide except it s not and it doesn t trump budget 4 0 as in previous years the trump budget 4 0 is landing with a thud in washington speak it likely will be dead on arrival more about that later trump s 4 89 trillion spending plan the final budget of his first term in office calls for increases to military spending and steep cuts to several domestic programs a reflection of his campaign priorities as he asks voters to return him to office for another four years it seeks 2 billion to build about 82 miles of additional wall along the southern border the latest contribution to the 1 000 mile project that was one of trump s signature promises during the 2016 presidential campaign budget blueprint trump s budget reflects campaign priorities but abandons pledge to wipe out deficit in 10 years congress gets its say one of the big ways the federal budget differs from your household spending plan you and your family develop your budget without seeking input from 535 other people that s not how it works in washington the budget the president sends to congress is just a starting point a way for the administration to spell out its spending priorities for the coming year lawmakers have their own ideas about how federal dollars should be spent and since they seldom line up closely with the president s vision congress usually shelves the president s budget proposal and writes its own the process becomes even more complicated when an opposing party is in charge as it is this year democrats led by speaker nancy pelosi control the house while republicans still hold the senate and the white house just how difficult it can be to pass a spending plan under divided government was illustrated last winter when a budget impasse triggered a record setting 35 day government shutdown the president s budget is usually doa the moment it reaches congress given the power split that will be especially true again this year options you don t have with debts like many americans the federal government spends more money than it has so like many americans it borrows money to pay its bills lots of money the national debt surpassed more than 23 trillion for the first time last october a milestone that experts warned is further proof the country is on an unsustainable financial path to put that amount into perspective the median u s household income was 61 372 in 2017 according to the census bureau if every american man woman and child earned that median wage and gave every penny of it to the government the total still wouldn t pay off the national debt the federal deficit the gap between the government s income and expenses approached 1 trillion last year the treasury department reported last fall the deficit grew to 984 billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 that was a 26 percent increase from the previous year and a 50 percent jump since trump has been in office analysts say nearly half of the increase can be traced to the sweeping 1 5 trillion tax cut that trump spearheaded and that took effect in 2018 as well as a two year budget deal that increased government spending by about 300 billion growth in social security medicare and other expenses also swell the deficit many struggling americans are forced to contend with their own budget deficit and are deep in debt consumer borrowing including credit cards rose last year by 22 1 billion according to figures released last week by the federal reserve consumer credit hit a record 1 1 trillion last year but the federal government has options that average americans don t if it needs more money it can raise taxes if it needs to borrow it can get much lower interest rates than consumers can if it hits its borrowing limit it can simply raise that ceiling individual americans eventually have to pay off their creditors when you die your estate settles your debts since the federal government doesn t go away neither does its debt it lives on and keeps accumulating entitlement cuts trump says he d take take a look at changing entitlements such as medicare why you should care for average americans the federal budget deficit may seem like a massive abstract number that has no effect on their daily lives it does or at least it can higher deficits could drive up borrowing costs for u s households and businesses when the government borrows money to pay its bills it issues treasury notes as the supply of treasurys increases their prices fall and yields rise to attract more buyers assuming demand is steady those higher rates can ripple across the economy nudging up rates on mortgages and other loans currently 10 year treasury rates are at a historically low 1 6 that s because in an uncertain global economy treasurys are viewed as a safe bet while countries such as turkey argentina and italy face financial crises no one expects uncle sam to default on debt but as the national debt swells and economic conditions change rates eventually could rise to levels that discourage consumer and business borrowing hurting the economy that means the federal government can run up outsize deficits far more easily than ordinary households which would face credit limits and higher interest rates if they did the same that may not always be the case especially if 1 trillion deficits continue to pile up and congress takes no steps to trim them over the longer term if investors start worrying about that treasury rates and borrowing costs across the economy could begin to edge higher another reason to fret about the deficit if the economy slides into another recession congress may be less likely to pass a big stimulus to help pull the country out of the doldrums if the package adds to an already yawning budget gap that could mean more layoffs fewer job openings and smaller raises for american workers budget blueprint trump budget proposal pitches billions for rural america a key constituency in 2020 yes the national debt affects you one of the many ways it impacts you is how much you earn debt not only suppresses economic growth it also suppresses future wages the congressional budget office projects that average income in 30 years will be 5 000 less per year if the national debt continues its trajectory that means average income for a family of four will drop by 16 000 over the next three decades if debt rises as projected according to the peter g peterson foundation a nonpartisan organization dedicated to addressing the country s long term fiscal challenges if that happens you ll have less money to spend on necessities such as food gas and clothing or to put extra money in your savings account or 401 k rising debt and deficits can lead to higher interest rates higher interest rates mean it will cost more to borrow money to buy a house or a car paying for college tuition or starting your own business will become more expensive higher interest rates affect credit card purchases so expenses such as buying gas or groceries or even going on vacation will cost more programs such as food stamps and unemployment benefits that help the most vulnerable in society could face cuts if the government has less money to spend it may be more difficult to prop up financially strapped programs such as medicare which is projected to run out of money by 2026 and social security which is likely to be insolvent by 2034 unless benefits are cut or other steps are taken to shore up the programs the deficit should matter to anyone who cares about the future of america said michael a peterson ceo of the peterson foundation high and rising debt hurts our ability to build the future we want for the next generation because interest costs have become the fastest growing part of the federal budget interest on the debt will average 87 000 per person over the next 25 years nearly four times the average student loan balance for a person under the age of 30 that s not good for the budget our economy or our nation s many priorities peterson said failing to manage this debt problem now makes it harder for all americans down the road if the united states continues on its trajectory interest payments on the national debt will amount to the single largest government program within three decades according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget border wall funding trump proposes 2b for 82 miles of border wall with goal of completing 400 miles by end of 2020

this article is more than 4 years old china s wuhan pneumonia remains largely contained in the city where the new viral pathogen was first discovered by doctors in early december photo by prakash mathema afp via getty images afp via getty images the end is near in a good way some chinese factories are re opening the chinese government has already cut taxes and interest rates on companies impacted by the coronavirus epidemic there and whether or not chinese people are really willing to return to work today on the orders of the authorities the market is dying to call a bottom on this thing it s like wall street is set to price in the v shape recovery before it even prices in losses to the economy assuming the novel coronavirus remains in the spotlight for the rest of the first quarter the xtrackers harvest csi 300 china a shares ashr exchange traded fund was up 1 85 on monday it rose on news from china that a government coronavirus working group said it was safe for companies outside of the epicenter in hubei province to return to work mainlanders are of two polarized minds beijing is taking too long to contain this thing they re mad and beijing is doing a good job and this will all be over soon they re trusting investors are largely in line with the latter though this is definitely a fickle bunch death tolls surpassed sars level proportions on sunday hitting 910 today and seen surpassing 1 000 by the weekend recovery rates are rising but the number of confirmed cases is still over 2 000 a day viruses being tricky this number could worsen at any given moment investors would quickly change their tune the novel coronavirus remains a pathogen of unknown origin believed to have come either from a bat infection passed onto humans through a bite or human consumption or as a genetically modified virus that escaped a virology lab in wuhan when this rate of new infections reverts to linear rather than exponential growth we will be more comfortable calling a market bottom says dara white head of global emerging market equities for columbia threadneedle investments china to the rescue not like it did in in the past says sue trinh senior macro strategist for manulife investment management in hong kong manulife investment management china s stock market has weathered this very well at its worse ashr was down 13 9 on february 3 year to date it s now down just 8 pulling farther away from bear territory in the 8 months long sars outbreak of 2002 03 the annual impact on chinese gdp is estimated to have been 1 the chinese economy is different now with consumer spending accounting for nearly 70 of gdp growth that means the impact on the chinese economy and those reliant on chinese consumers may be longer lasting chinese who canceled flights are not going to suddenly reschedule them chinese who spent less in restaurants or on gasoline are not going to suddenly double down when all returns to normal many of those sales are lost with the exception of the uber bears out there who think china s debt load will do them in any day now consensus has this as a short term negative we expect an economic impact but a transitory one with a quick rebound in growth once the virus is contained the market will look through any earning misses or reduced guidance once containment is in sight dara white emerging markets equity chief columbia threadneedle investments the global economy has gotten used to relying on chinese stimulus to rekindle growth in bad times they did it in 2009 during the great recession and again in 2013 during the taper tantrum that squashed emerging markets on liquidity fears during the trade war china s response has been limited to measures such as tax cuts reductions in bank reserve requirements and tweaks to local government bond issuance officials have also called for more lending to small and mid sized businesses including debt extensions for companies facing financial problems due to trade war woes consensus may suggest a bottom is near for the coronavirus but investors are also convinced that china will grow below 6 for the first time since joining the world trade organization in 2001 beijing will have to accept that it might miss its 6 gdp growth target for 2020 a development that would mark a critical turning point in the global growth cycle says sue trinh senior macro strategist for manulife investment management in hong kong for trinha the chinese government s restraint can be traced back to how previous rounds of credit fueled stimulus aggravated problems in the banking sector given xi jinping s preference to avoid credit bubbles the scale of any forthcoming stimulus will likely be limited and insufficient to reflate the global economy the communist party needs growth but it needs stability even more if the market is wrong and the coronavirus still has a long way to work itself out of the system then china s unwillingness and perhaps its inability to finance its way out of this is an unpriced risk not only for china but for emerging markets that rely on them as a top trading partner the good news for the coronavirus is that recovery rates are approaching 4 000 of the 910 deaths 871 of them are in hubei this still looks fairly well contained in the u s and europe new infections have slowed to a halt over the last few days the u s still has 12 cases all of them wuhan travelers or someone infected by a wuhan traveler hong kong has 38 cases their government has travel restrictions with the mainland poorer countries with weaker public health infrastructure have been spared in africa and latin america there have been no cases reported there trinh thinks asia will see an l shaped recovery that depends on whether u s dollar strength persists and if beijing holds back from unleashing a massive stimulus to revive china s economy she says
luis arce catacora bolivian presidential candidate for the movement towards socialism party mas is held up by supporters as he is welcomed at the airport before he departs el alto bolivia jan 28 arce was endorsed by exiled president evo morales as his party s candidate for may 3 presidential elections juan karita ap bolivia s presidential elections are scheduled to take place on may 3 2020 the elections will be organized by the transitional government of jeanine √°√±ez who seized power in a u s backed military coup on november 10 2019 the coup forced out the democratically elected leftist indigenous government of evo morales who presided over an economic boom following a rejection of imf imposed neoliberal measures the elections that brought √°√±ez to power were announced after a pacification of the country that saw two massacres of indigenous protesters who rose up by the hundreds of thousands calling for the return of morales the u s embassy hailed the transitional period as a courageous defense of democracy and praised the commitment of the √°√±ez administration to free and fair elections the technical organization of the elections will be carried out in conjunction with usaid and the organization of american states oas the election run up has already been marked by persecution and threats against the most prominent figures of morales s movement towards socialism mas party nevertheless the mas is keen to go ahead with the elections and polls show that they still wield considerable influence in the country the mas has also selected candidates choosing luis arce catacora and david choquehuanca to run for president and vice president respectively catacora served as morales s economy minister while choquehuanca was his longest serving foreign minister the two were initially selected on january 19 by a commission of social movement and party leaders who traveled to buenos aires they were then approved on the following thursday by the pacto de unidad the unity pact of mas affiliated social movements catacora and choquehuanca are likely to face an array of right wing candidates almost all of whom have deep and direct ties to washington that long pre date the november coup that forced morales to flee the country they range from centrist neoliberals to far right authoritarians the u s state department is flexible in whom it works with this article is the first installment of a two part series covering the coming election this article will focus on the mas candidates look at their politics and track record in government and will judge the strength of morales s party in this new climate of persecution against them the second installment will explore the pro coup candidates and their ties to washington the instrumento the mas as an organization certainly isn t a party with orthodox structures and organization it grew out of debates within the indigenous campesino movement about the need for a political instrument to represent the country s indigenous majority and in particular organized rural campesinos farmers and peasants who had never had the opportunity to participate in mainstream politics long dominated by a tiny white urban elite by the time the mas was fully formed it had grown to become a coalition of the most important organized indigenous movements in alliance with a collection of middle class urban marxist intellectuals who had broken with dogmatic thinking that looked down on the indigenous campesino movement choquehuanca and catacora come precisely from those two currents respectively the two ideological currents are born from entirely distinct cultures and experiences but nevertheless have managed to coexist within the party for 20 years with varying levels of tension indigenism and economic stability the newspaper p√°gina siete labeled the duo as representing indigenism and economic stability as they struggled to find a basis with which to smear two of morales s most popular former ministers catacora had served as morales s economy minister throughout the entire process of change he is seen as the brains behind bolivia s economic miracle that followed the nationalization of natural resources and strategic industries fake charges were drawn up against him by the √°√±ez administration less than 24 hours after he was announced as a candidate catacora was born and raised in urban la paz studying economics at the highest levels he went on to earn a master s degree from warwick university in the uk a ph d in bolivia and a job at the central bank yet catacora really earned his stripes during the years of social struggle in the early 2000s when evo morales was a union leader during those years he ran a marxist study circle in la paz called los duendes made up of former members of marcelo quiroga s socialist party los duendes was part of a web of new radical intellectual circles grappling with what the future of the left would be following the collapse of the soviet union and what a transition to socialism would look like in the new age of globalization in a 2015 interview he recalled the kind of discussions they had in the 90s the privatizations began the book the end of history by francis fukuyama came out where capitalism was said to be the last stage in los duendes we argued that this was impossible we set out to present what comes after neoliberalism this research would later be reflected in the plans of the mas we had to work on proposing an economic model that we could later implement there were a number of such groups the most prominent being former vice president √°lvaro garc√≠a linera s comuna group commenting on his relationship with linera s group catacora said in a meeting of the duende group with √°lvaro garc√≠a linera we agreed on several positions and realized that we spoke the same language pursued the same objective but using different instruments and tools comuna observed the sociological political process in great depth while duende worked on the transition to socialism from the point of view of the construction of a new economic model his role in this milieu of heterodox marxist intellectuals is how catacora earned his place in the movement towards socialism he and √°lvaro garc√≠a are representatives of this scene par excellence but it s also the reason there s been some disquiet among some sections of the indigenous movements some see this layer as a privileged group the invitados who are bequeathed with candidacies to high office despite not rising through the ranks of the indigenous and workers movements it s a complaint i ve heard repeatedly at internal party and union meetings across the country even in morales s ultra loyal base in the chapar√© region though this creative tension has always existed in his speech proclaiming catacora as candidate morales repeated his understanding of the movement as an alliance of indigenous groups and the blancos sanos the good whites sumaq qama√±a david choquehuanca the vice presidential candidate was morales s first and longest serving foreign minister and the second longest serving minister after catacora in a cabinet that was otherwise changing every season choquehuanca is himself indigenous aymara and is overwhelmingly favored by indigenous movements across the country i was in huanuni oruro at a meeting of pacto de unidad when one member after another nominated him for president in fact some are now upset that he s been selected for the lesser role of vice president choquehuanca is the mas s primary theorist of its indigenous wing as foreign minister he convened conferences across latin america to expound the concept of sumaq qama√±a living well sumaq qama√±a is a philosophy based on indigenous principles of reciprocity collectiveness balance with mother nature pachamama decolonization recuperation of indigenous music art dance and forms of living not as a folkloric or ethnic part of bolivian culture but as the central basis of national identity choquehuanca summed it up as to live well sumaq qama√±a is to look for the experience in community where all members care for all the most important thing is not the human prioritized by socialism nor money prioritized by capitalism but life it is intended to seek a simpler life become the path of harmony between nature and life choquehuanca s r√©sum√© would suggest a life on the traditional marxist left he received a scholarship to study at a political cadre school in cuba and after leaving the foreign ministry he became secretary of alba the principal international organization of the latin american left nevertheless his championing of indigenous philosophy and proximity to campesino movements rather than the urban left have won him a solid base of support particularly in the andean departments of bolivia he received crucial backing in the indigenous city of el alto where in mid december he was proclaimed the chosen candidate at a meeting of mas aligned movements in the city the mood among attendees was hopeful but also determined to have choquehuanca and no one else as candidate the chair of the meeting didn t mince words he s a man who looks for unity for the sumaq qama√±a that s why we ve attached ourselves to him as an indigenous leader as a leader for the unity of the whole country we respect the decision of the rank and file to back choquehuanca we re not going to allow impositions when it was announced that choquehuanca was chosen to run as vice president those same movements were enraged choquehuanca himself came out to calm fears praising catacora and pointing out that the right want to divide us and they ll have a party if we let ourselves be divided whatever concerns there are about the pair it s undeniable that they better than anyone represent the two ideological currents that made the mas into what it is today in power catacora and choquehuanca steered the two most important policy transformations of their period in government bolivia s foreign policy has seen the most dramatic change since the coup in just a couple of months the √°√±ez administration has re established full diplomatic relations with the united states and israel withdrew from alba recognized the self declared juan guaid√≥ as president of venezuela cut ties with cuba and rolled out the red carpet for usaid it was choquehuanca s work building an anti imperialist foreign policy that was undone with the most haste it was under his leadership at the foreign ministry that the u s ambassador was expelled u s military bases were closed and bolivia restricted israeli visas in solidarity with the people of gaza choquehuanca also oversaw bolivia s policy of solidarity with venezuela cuba and other progressive countries when they were under attack by the united states these issues are likely to surface prominently in the coming election the economic miracle as crucial as foreign policy has been for the regime the bolivian economic model brainchild of catacora is the centerpiece of the mas electoral campaign the early phase of the model can be summarized as the nationalization of strategic industries the profits from which provide the bolivian state the resources to invest in previously non existent infrastructure and social spending this stimulates internal demand and feeds the growth of the private sector in particular the tertiary sector the next phase which bolivia had only just begun to embark on before the coup was the industrialization of natural resources the aim was to surpass the country s former position in the global south condemned to live off the export of cheap raw materials european social democratic parties such as the uk labour party often limit nationalization plans to industries they consider to be vital public services like health transportation and utilities in bolivia nationalization reached the upper echelons of the economy and in early years included natural resources natural gas some mining lithium telecommunications entel airports transport boa the national airline telef√©rico and manufacturing including numerous state owned factories in a variety of industries from cement to paper this meant that profits stayed in the country and allowed the government to cover its costs and embark on ambitious social spending rural development and infrastructure projects like building highways in areas of the country that had only ever known seclusion and dirt roads this in turn stimulated the private sector the movement of goods along with higher living standards meant that the number of registered businesses grew by 500 percent by the end of morales s second term in the years prior to the mas economic reforms bolivia could only generate enough cash to cover basic costs and debts by printing money resulting in an annual inflation rate of over 27 000 by 1985 though the hyperinflationary era was overcome the neoliberal shock therapy that was used to overcome it left the government as little more than an estado mendigo beggar state a term morales often used to describe the period of dependency on western financial institutions and aid western ngos flourished in bolivia as attempts to deal with the humanitarian crisis were farmed out to them by 2005 the year before morales was first elected outgoing neoliberal president carlos mesa s resignation speech turned into a bizarre tirade as he explained the extent to which the bolivian economy was no longer able to pay for even the most basic functions of the state mesa explained how even public sector salaries were only being paid at all thanks to the charity that he had begged for at the imf and other western institutions in addressing the economic failures of the neoliberal period the results are undeniable the economy today is over three times the size it was in 2005 the purchasing power of minimum wage workers has skyrocketed as rapid wage growth has been combined with low inflation the rate of general poverty that once stood at over 60 in 2005 dropped to around 34 percent by 2018 in 2005 35 of bolivians belonged to the middle class now over 60 percent do that s around three million people in a country of 11 million cities like el alto are no longer centers of appalling poverty and underdevelopment but are engines of growth for the whole country indeed el alto has been host to a particular kind of growth that has meant some of its newly wealthy indigenous residents have produced a new modern and luxury evolution of andean culture rather than turning to western chain stores and miami holidays like other latin americans who have dollars to spare the interior and exterior of the cholets mansions owned by indigenous residents of el alto incorporate andean colors and designs into their property in flagrant defiance of western architectural norms the next phase of the economic model was industrialization a path that was just beginning to be realized before it was interrupted by the coup the idea is simple and was already yielding results not content with merely redistributing the profits of exporting raw materials the bolivian government was preparing the industrialization of those natural resources meaning that rather than exporting crude gas or lithium in its natural state the government would invest in building the industrial capacity to process those materials in bolivia and sell value added finished products this was already taking place with bolivia s vast lithium reserves the country was producing its first domestically manufactured cars that included batteries made with lithium when evo morales first came to power bolivia exported natural gas but imported refined gas used for cooking and heating now however bolivia is a net exporter of refined gas this is only possible because of state investment in nationalized companies enormous challenges ahead the mas has chosen its candidates the social movements that form the party back them they re ahead in the polls and the u s backed right is divided among at least four candidates in normal conditions this would bode extremely well for the party but of course these elections are not taking place in a normal environment they re taking place in an environment where mas activists are being jailed on charges of sedition for posting memes where arrest warrants are issued to those who hosted left wing radio shows where even the mas s presidential candidate has fake charges hanging over him charges that were invented the day after his candidacy was announced will he spend election day in a cell there s every reason to believe that even if the elections aren t rigged then the persecution against the mas could well be ramped up to the extent where they cannot in any way campaign openly will the u s human rights industry and the oas speak up bolivians are not holding their breath this article was first

possible that future circumstances might differ from the assumptions on which such statements are based in addition other important factors that could cause results to differ materially include the

includes non gaap revenue non gaap recurring revenue non gaap gross profit non gaap gross margin non gaap income from operations non gaap operating margin non gaap net income and non gaap diluted earnings per share blackbaud has acquired businesses whose net tangible assets include deferred revenue in accordance with gaap reporting requirements blackbaud recorded write downs of deferred revenue to fair value which resulted in lower recognized revenue both on a quarterly and year to date basis the revenue for the acquired businesses is deferred and typically recognized over a one year period so blackbaud s gaap revenues for the one year period after the acquisitions will not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value the non gaap measures described above reverse the acquisition related deferred revenue write downs so that the full amount of revenue booked by the acquired companies is included which blackbaud believes provides a more accurate representation of a revenue run rate in a given period in addition to reversing write downs of acquisition related deferred revenue non gaap financial measures discussed above exclude the impact of certain items that blackbaud believes are not directly related to its performance in any particular period but are for its long term benefit over multiple periods in addition blackbaud uses non gaap organic revenue growth non gaap organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis and non gaap organic recurring revenue growth in analyzing its operating performance blackbaud believes that these non gaap measures are useful to investors as a supplement to gaap measures for evaluating the periodic growth of its business on a consistent basis each of these measures excludes incremental acquisition related revenue attributable to companies acquired in the current fiscal year for companies acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year each of these measures reflects presentation of full year incremental non gaap revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period and it includes the non gaap revenue attributable to those companies as if there were no acquisition related write downs of acquired deferred revenue to fair value as required by gaap in addition each of these measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses the exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods blackbaud believes this presentation provides a more comparable representation of its current business organic revenue growth and revenue run rate non gaap free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures including costs required to be capitalized for software development and capital expenditures for property and equipment blackbaud uses these non gaap financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors as a supplement to gaap measures in evaluating blackbaud s ongoing operational performance blackbaud believes that these non gaap financial measures reflect blackbaud s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparison and analysis of trends in its business in addition blackbaud believes that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides additional information for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial results from period to period with other companies in blackbaud s industry many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors however these non gaap financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in the exact method of calculation between companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap investors are

by hugh bronstein buenos aires feb 10 reuters argentina heads into do or die talks this week with its biggest creditor the international monetary fund fresh from a failed bond sale on monday that augured poorly for the government s plan for revamping about 100 billion in debt the country wants to postpone debt payments while honoring its promise to voters to avoid painful budget cuts that agenda was dealt a blow on monday when the economy ministry sent a one sentence statement saying without explanation that the planned issue of peso denominated debt had been abandoned the government wanted to issue debt at a lower interest rate than investors were willing to accept this unsuccessful episode is not a good sign ahead of the imf talks and the restructuring process said gabriel zelpo director of buenos aires economic consultancy seido left leaning president alberto fernandez hopes to convince the fund to rejig 44 billion in suspended loans under a program that would avoid the kind of fiscal austerity and structural reforms the imf typically imposes to restore nations finances the government also wants imf approval of its plan to restructure tens of billions of dollars owed to bondholders it hopes to achieve all this before a march 31 deadline it has imposed on itself so it may refocus on restoring growth the future of latin america s no 3 economy hinges on the wednesday through friday discussions to be held in buenos aires between imf and argentine officials the week may end without a hard statement from either side about new economic or debt management policies however the government needs to make the perfect move with a bond restructuring that the imf can approve and that balances the need for some fiscal austerity with the political restrictions imposed by the government s leftist coalition zelpo said if it is successful the economy will recover if not the recession will deepen he said analysts expect on average an economic contraction of 1 5 this year fernandez s late 2019 election was a rebuke to previous leader mauricio macri who killed his own hopes of re election by imposing unpopular subsidy cuts that fueled inflation while his over borrowing in the bond market helped weaken the local peso currency by 83 during his four year term complicated past the imf and argentina have a complicated past many blame the fund s policies for causing a 2001 economic meltdown that threw millions of middle class argentines into poverty a 2018 run on the peso nonetheless forced macri into a 57 billion imf loan agreement that included tough fiscal targets only 44 billion of that money was distributed before the agreement was put on hold last year when argentina admitted it would have to rejig a total of about 100 billion in debt economy minister martin guzman has approached the imf and bondholders with talk of an investor friendly bond revamp while making it clear the government will neither risk worsening the recession by imposing fiscal austerity nor keep making unsustainable bond payments the fund and the government both say they expect a productive dialogue this week the ministry wants to get the imf on board with its plan for delaying debt service payments long enough to let the economy emerge from recession and to improve its repayment capacity i don t know if there will be an explicit or implicit endorsement from the imf of the actual bond restructuring said siobhan morden head of latin america fixed income strategy at amherst pierpont securities an imf endorsement would signal optimism for future debt repayment capacity morden said adding that argentina was likely to miss its deadline of getting a debt revamp signed by the end of march so the best case is a soft endorsement in which the imf signals flexibility for negotiating on loan re profiling there is no chance of a revised imf program in march but there could be headlines of progress towards a future agreement she said reporting by hugh bronstein additional reporting by gabriel burin maximilian heath and rodrigo campos editing by chizu nomiyama sonya hepinstall shri navaratnam hugh bronstein thomsonreuters com 5411 4318 0655 reuters messaging hugh bronstein thomsonreuters com reuters net the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc

in a growth mind set challenges are exciting rather than threatening so rather than thinking oh i m going to reveal my weaknesses you say wow here s a chance to grow carol s dweck by shaun jayaratnam on december 31 1991 the ussr ceased to exist the russian federation a new state embarked on the road to democracy and a market economy with no clear plan of how to complete such a transformation i spent my twenties building a career during the turbulent decade following the collapse of the soviet union for me a time of considerable development and growth when i arrived in the autumn of 1989 on my 1st business trip outside of singapore i did not speak russian i did not understand the history and culture of the country nor was i prepared for the severe winter everything was alien to me yet i was excited with the unknown in awe with russia and the endless possibilities i saw in front of me i first engaged a professor of linguistics from moscow state university to teach me russian 3 times a week 2 hours each day with no cnn or bbc nor any english channels every street sign in russian and barely anyone speaking english i had to pick up russian fast having formally studied mandarin since the age of four till eighteen my professor was confident russian would be easy for me and true enough i was able to read write and converse in basic russian within 3 months advertisement managing a small business in russia required riding through domestic turbulence and a succession of shocks in an era of corrupt officials inefficiency informal practices violence murders by bombing or gunfire involving the russian mafia i was in over my head yet drawn to the thrill of it all being thrown into the deep end leaving your comfort zone facing adversity will tax your perseverance to the point where you are forced to grow and do things differently to achieve your goals i was determined to learn driven to succeed mentored by an entrepreneur who was my boss at the time so begin my decade long journey in post soviet russia which was struggling to overcome cataclysmic political economic and societal challenges i observed the russian transition at first hand from gorbachev to the fall of the russian white house to yeltsin and now putin i was part of history in the making it was here that i learnt in chaos there s opportunity that there is an offsetting opportunity in every obstacle or adversity for a young man from singapore with little knowledge about computers ferrous and non ferrous metals oil gas building materials i learnt fast familiarising myself with different industries brokered profitable deals with the adrenalin rush i got from each successful deal i closed i challenged myself further the sky was the limit i said starting in moscow i ventured inwards to yekaterinburg krasnodar rostov kazan perm novosibirsk to every corner of russia where there was a business opportunity i began to be drawn towards frontier and emerging markets i realised being relatively untapped they offered a higher growth potential not satisfied with just russia i travelled across the border to ukraine kazakhstan uzbekistan georgia armenia all the countries in the cis covering thousands of miles on planes road and rail across multiple 1st 2nd and 3rd tier cities and borders my life was threatened more than once and i ve been robbed i paid a hefty tuition fee but it was well worth it the learning curve was exponential as russia taught me to face my fears to learn to trust my gut feel to be resilient to improvise and to develop new perspective and ingenuity russia was my university of hard knocks my harvard business school the soviet union enjoyed extensive relationships across africa for decades through its support for national liberation movements in angola mozambique or guinea bissau these relationships came to an abrupt halt with the collapse of the soviet regime the patrice lumumba university in moscow renamed peoples friendship university of russia established in 1961 was named after the first prime minister of congo its mandate was to provide education to students especially from poor families across asia africa and latin america prominent african politicians including few of the older generation studied there these included namibia hifikepunye pohamba as well as some younger ones like former prime minister of chad youssouf saleh abbas and the central african republic s former president back then the university had small cafes started by enterprising students offering delicacies from their home countries in the early 1990 s this was the most authentic ethnic food you ll find in moscow at affordable student prices it was here that i was first introduced to fufu and jollof rice way before i stepped into africa my first introduction to nigeria ghana cameroon and drc began 30 years ago when i made friends with students from these countries who were working part time either bartending or waiters at establishments i use to patronise i had no clue where these countries were but my new friends were kind enough to give me a quick lesson in geography we were strangers in a strange land eager to learn from each other and slowly a bond was form via the same university i met students from peru brazil nicaragua philippines india etc many my friends today never did i imagine that one day i ll be doing business across multiple countries on the african continent nor how prepared i will be because of my experiences in russia the russian rouble crisis or the russian financial crisis hit russia in 17th aug 1998 the government devalued the rouble defaulted on domestic debts the whole system just crashed effecting the economies of the neighbouring countries as well the crisis led to the fall of many companies exodus of many expats it was time to leave regroup reassess unlearn and relearn entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage niccolo machiavelli back home in singapore i realised how much i ve missed out on the growth opportunities across asia my russian and east european expertise brought me back to developing business across the cis and east europe but at the same time i prospected for business across south east asia not wanting to be labelled as a russian or east european market specialist i was constantly looking out for my next challenge this challenge was given to me by a chilean company who were expanding into africa seeking someone to lead the charge having no knowledge about africa i networked every event forum seminar etc involving the continent it was at one of these forums that i met a diplomat from the angolan embassy in singapore whose ambassador at the time studied in russia during the late 1980 s he found my own experiences intriguing enough to render me an audience with his boss divine intervention perhaps i spoke no portuguese and although the ambassador and i spoke english we just could not help speaking russian for an hour or so sharing our love for russian music history art literature and politics interestingly my russian language skills opened my 1st door into africa taking me a week later to angola subsequently on a journey of discovery across the vast continent in luanda my first client only spoke portuguese but fortunately his sister studied in russia at patrice lumumba university no less so we conducted our business entirely with me speaking russian to his sister whilst she translated in portuguese i spent the first one and half years in africa traveling on trade missions led by the singapore business federation starting in the east covering djibouti to uganda kenya rwanda ethiopia then to west africa covering congo kinshasa congo brazzaville cameroon gabon ghana togo and benin africa is a continent not a country it s made up of 54 countries there are cultural economic and linguistic differences across the continent more so between sub saharan africa and north africa the number of languages spoken is between 1 250 and 2 100 some even estimate it to be 3 000 nigeria alone has over 500 languages it s crucial to spend time understanding the cultures language and the people do not make assumptions armed with my limited french language skills i boldly ventured on my own to mauritania senegal mali gambia liberia burkina faso niger nigeria chad central african republic etc networking with locals and foreign businessmen along the way learning to navigate the markets friends eager to explore africa but fearing the unknown soon joined me i ve driven from ouagadougou to bobo dioulasso in burkina faso starting at 5am for 5 hours just to meet couple of clients and back that same day after 10pm i ve travelled on bus from maradi to tahoua in niger just to meet one client drove from bamako to timbuktu in mali crossed the border from benin into nigeria from nzassi into cabinda i ve been robbed in uganda etc exhilarating experiences in nouakchott mauritania while driving around the city looking for a chinese restaurant i stumbled upon a brand new chinese trade association building 6 stories high who welcomed me with open arms simply because i spoke mandarin and was family i was given an open invitation to stay with them the association had a restaurant and a hotel within the building any time i m in nouakchott with an increasing number of chinese businesses venturing into africa my mandarin language skills has come in handy i was blending in i slowly understood the operating environment of the many markets across the continent the colonial history the francophone anglophone and lusophone countries mind set tribal differences the cfa zones the ethnic business communities that hold monopolies on some trade trade blocs distribution of goods the porous borders etc several countries on the continent are plagued by political instability spiralling corruption and poor governance it s no secret that things often get done here by cutting corners greasing palms or looking the other way these are common harsh realities and taken for granted corruption remains a major issue in many african countries affecting the lives of citizens at multiple levels illicit trade has had devastating impact on legal markets and on state revenues the porous borders across africa today has led to the rise of trans border crimes poor landlocked nations such as the chad and mali are subject to significant amounts of goods transits along roads and have largely uncontrolled land borders poor road infrastructure make transporting goods from ports to inland countries costly and time consuming differences in taxation policies and subsidies contribute to smuggling across borders one example is fuel which is highly subsidised in one or two countries creates an incentive for the product to be smuggled into neighbouring countries that border them this is africa or tia as it s commonly used by african s and non africans basically means take a chill pill go with the flow relax this is how it is in africa often as a sigh of resignation over time you start to learn to accept and use this term on a regular basis c est la vie across the continent there are a range of inconveniences from power cuts general inefficiency infuriating bureaucracy and questionable ethics but there is also rapid

on december 31 1991 the ussr ceased to exist the russian federation a new state embarked on the road to in a growth mind set challenges are exciting rather than threatening so rather than thinking oh i m going to reveal my weaknesses you say wow here s a chance to grow carol s dweck by shaun jayaratnam on december 31 1991 the ussr ceased to exist the russian federation a new state embarked on the road to democracy and a market economy with no clear plan of how to complete such a transformation i spent my twenties building a career during the turbulent decade following the collapse of the soviet union for me a time of considerable development and growth when i arrived in the autumn of 1989 on my 1st business trip outside of singapore i did not speak russian i did not understand the history and culture of the country nor was i prepared for the severe winter everything was alien to me yet i was excited with the unknown in awe with russia and the endless possibilities i saw in front of me i first engaged a professor of linguistics from moscow state university to teach me russian 3 times a week 2 hours each day with no cnn or bbc nor any english channels every street sign in russian and barely anyone speaking english i had to pick up russian fast having formally studied mandarin since the age of four till eighteen my professor was confident russian would be easy for me and true enough i was able to read write and converse in basic russian within 3 months managing a small business in russia required riding through domestic turbulence and a succession of shocks in an era of corrupt officials inefficiency informal practices violence murders by bombing or gunfire involving the russian mafia i was in over my head yet drawn to the thrill of it all being thrown into the deep end leaving your comfort zone facing adversity will tax your perseverance to the point where you are forced to grow and do things differently to achieve your goals i was determined to learn driven to succeed mentored by an entrepreneur who was my boss at the time so begin my decade long journey in post soviet russia which was struggling to overcome cataclysmic political economic and societal challenges i observed the russian transition at first hand from gorbachev to the fall of the russian white house to yeltsin and now putin i was part of history in the making it was here that i learnt in chaos there s opportunity that there is an offsetting opportunity in every obstacle or adversity for a young man from singapore with little knowledge about computers ferrous and non ferrous metals oil gas building materials i learnt fast familiarising myself with different industries brokered profitable deals with the adrenalin rush i got from each successful deal i closed i challenged myself further the sky was the limit i said starting in moscow i ventured inwards to yekaterinburg krasnodar rostov kazan perm novosibirsk to every corner of russia where there was a business opportunity i began to be drawn towards frontier and emerging markets i realised being relatively untapped they offered a higher growth potential not satisfied with just russia i travelled across the border to ukraine kazakhstan uzbekistan georgia armenia all the countries in the cis covering thousands of miles on planes road and rail across multiple 1st 2nd and 3rd tier cities and borders my life was threatened more than once and i ve been robbed i paid a hefty tuition fee but it was well worth it the learning curve was exponential as russia taught me to face my fears to learn to trust my gut feel to be resilient to improvise and to develop new perspective and ingenuity russia was my university of hard knocks my harvard business school the soviet union enjoyed extensive relationships across africa for decades through its support for national liberation movements in angola mozambique or guinea bissau these relationships came to an abrupt halt with the collapse of the soviet regime the patrice lumumba university in moscow renamed peoples friendship university of russia established in 1961 was named after the first prime minister of congo its mandate was to provide education to students especially from poor families across asia africa and latin america prominent african politicians including few of the older generation studied there these included namibia hifikepunye pohamba as well as some younger ones like former prime minister of chad youssouf saleh abbas and the central african republic s former president back then the university had small cafes started by enterprising students offering delicacies from their home countries in the early 1990 s this was the most authentic ethnic food you ll find in moscow at affordable student prices it was here that i was first introduced to fufu and jollof rice way before i stepped into africa my first introduction to nigeria ghana cameroon and drc began 30 years ago when i made friends with students from these countries who were working part time either bartending or waiters at establishments i use to patronise i had no clue where these countries were but my new friends were kind enough to give me a quick lesson in geography we were strangers in a strange land eager to learn from each other and slowly a bond was form via the same university i met students from peru brazil nicaragua philippines india etc many my friends today never did i imagine that one day i ll be doing business across multiple countries on the african continent nor how prepared i will be because of my experiences in russia the russian rouble crisis or the russian financial crisis hit russia in 17th aug 1998 the government devalued the rouble defaulted on domestic debts the whole system just crashed effecting the economies of the neighbouring countries as well the crisis led to the fall of many companies exodus of many expats it was time to leave regroup reassess unlearn and relearn entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage niccolo machiavelli back home in singapore i realised how much i ve missed out on the growth opportunities across asia my russian and east european expertise brought me back to developing business across the cis and east europe but at the same time i prospected for business across south east asia not wanting to be labelled as a russian or east european market specialist i was constantly looking out for my next challenge this challenge was given to me by a chilean company who were expanding into africa seeking someone to lead the charge having no knowledge about africa i networked every event forum seminar etc involving the continent it was at one of these forums that i met a diplomat from the angolan embassy in singapore whose ambassador at the time studied in russia during the late 1980 s he found my own experiences intriguing enough to render me an audience with his boss divine intervention perhaps i spoke no portuguese and although the ambassador and i spoke english we just could not help speaking russian for an hour or so sharing our love for russian music history art literature and politics interestingly my russian language skills opened my 1st door into africa taking me a week later to angola subsequently on a journey of discovery across the vast continent in luanda my first client only spoke portuguese but fortunately his sister studied in russia at patrice lumumba university no less so we conducted our business entirely with me speaking russian to his sister whilst she translated in portuguese i spent the first one and half years in africa traveling on trade missions led by the singapore business federation starting in the east covering djibouti to uganda kenya rwanda ethiopia then to west africa covering congo kinshasa congo brazzaville cameroon gabon ghana togo and benin africa is a continent not a country it s made up of 54 countries there are cultural economic and linguistic differences across the continent more so between sub saharan africa and north africa the number of languages spoken is between 1 250 and 2 100 some even estimate it to be 3 000 nigeria alone has over 500 languages it s crucial to spend time understanding the cultures language and the people do not make assumptions armed with my limited french language skills i boldly ventured on my own to mauritania senegal mali gambia liberia burkina faso niger nigeria chad central african republic etc networking with locals and foreign businessmen along the way learning to navigate the markets friends eager to explore africa but fearing the unknown soon joined me i ve driven from ouagadougou to bobo dioulasso in burkina faso starting at 5am for 5 hours just to meet couple of clients and back that same day after 10pm i ve travelled on bus from maradi to tahoua in niger just to meet one client drove from bamako to timbuktu in mali crossed the border from benin into nigeria from nzassi into cabinda i ve been robbed in uganda etc exhilarating experiences in nouakchott mauritania while driving around the city looking for a chinese restaurant i stumbled upon a brand new chinese trade association building 6 stories high who welcomed me with open arms simply because i spoke mandarin and was family i was given an open invitation to stay with them the association had a restaurant and a hotel within the building any time i m in nouakchott with an increasing number of chinese businesses venturing into africa my mandarin language skills has come in handy i was blending in i slowly understood the operating environment of the many markets across the continent the colonial history the francophone anglophone and lusophone countries mind set tribal differences the cfa zones the ethnic business communities that hold monopolies on some trade trade blocs distribution of goods the porous borders etc several countries on the continent are plagued by political instability spiralling corruption and poor governance it s no secret that things often get done here by cutting corners greasing palms or looking the other way these are common harsh realities and taken for granted corruption remains a major issue in many african countries affecting the lives of citizens at multiple levels illicit trade has had devastating impact on legal markets and on state revenues the porous borders across africa today has led to the rise of trans border crimes poor landlocked nations such as the chad and mali are subject to significant amounts of goods transits along roads and have largely uncontrolled land borders poor road infrastructure make transporting goods from ports to inland countries costly and time consuming differences in taxation policies and subsidies contribute to smuggling across borders one example is fuel which is highly subsidised in one or two countries creates an incentive for the product to be smuggled into neighbouring countries that border them this is africa or tia as it s commonly used by african s and non africans basically means take a chill pill go with the flow relax this is how it is in africa often as a sigh of resignation over time you start to learn to accept and use this term on a regular basis c est la vie across the continent there are a range of

dow jones nasdaq 100 s p 500 gold fed trade war talking points wall street and gold prices rallied in 2019 on trade deal bets monetary policy us china phase two deal uncertain this year attention focuses on the fed technical outlook for dow jones nasdaq 100 s p 500 and gold analyzed dow jones nasdaq 100 s p 500 gold price recap rallying in tandem the dow jones nasdaq 100 and s p 500 began last year on a shaky footing after plummeting in the fourth quarter of 2018 which would see them close the year with a negative return in the months to follow us equities continued higher despite a lingering trade war that worked to create volatility and uncertainty alike will the stock market crash in 2020 while stocks fluctuated wildly on the back of new trade war developments gold emerged as an attractive investment amid the uncertainty and began to establish solid returns as the year progressed further trade war headwinds worked to erode global growth forecasts which sent recessionary fears soaring and stocks retreating the fundamental forces at play made it seem as though us equities were destined for another year of losses if not for a key tailwind the federal reserve monetary policy and repurchase agreements originally planned for 2019 was a path that envisioned three rate hikes but this outlook quickly reversed course amid growing concerns about the health of the global economy as trade wars heated up in the end the fed cut rates three times last year instead another crucial development in driving equities and anti fiat gold prices higher was the swelling in the fed s balance sheet amid a sudden cash shortage in the financial system in late september 2019 overnight lending rates unexpectedly surged to as much as 10 percent this was well above the central bank s target window of 1 75 2 00 at the time the fed turned to open market operations omo to tame short term borrowing costs specifically repurchases also known as repos these function as another window for institutions to borrow capital from the central bank in exchange for collateral often in the form of treasuries and interest financial institutions can borrow cash on a near term basis the timeframe for these can range from overnight to 14 days it acts as an injection of liquidity pushing down the cost of capital since these operations began the central bank s balance sheet has climbed from a low of 3 76t in august to above 4 15t in mid january 2020 see chart above the us china trade war with that in mind the road ahead for wall street and the precious metal in 2020 will likely heavily hinge on a couple of fundamental themes trade wars and the fed s balance sheet in the near term there is also the risk of how fears around the deadly coronavirus transpire much of the impact of trade talks has arguably already played out that was marked by the official signing between the us and china on the phase one agreement sentiment markedly improved in the lead up to the accord though follow through was rather lacking about 360b in u s tariffs against china remain and its fate is tied to a phase two trade deal the white house hinted that its completion could come after this year s presidential election it is uncertain whether president donald trump could remain in charge and a change in leadership could throw talks in a different direction in fact the risks for equities around the election seem to be tilted to the downside so what about monetary policy then federal reserve policy outlook after cutting rates three times in 2019 and expanding the balance sheet aggressively to round out the year the fed has doubled down on its wait and see policy in 2020 consequently markets are currently fully pricing in just one cut to the federal funds rate this year while officials like kansas city fed president esther george have argued pausing rate moves is more appropriate while the federal funds rate looks to be relatively stable for the time being policy regarding repo operations is more fluid the case for a continuation to that end the fed s january rate decision revealed the central bank s balance sheet is set to expand further still as it stands the fed has injected more than 400 billion since september and stocks have reacted in kind nevertheless jerome powell announced the central bank would continue overnight repo operations into april in turn the dow jones nasdaq 100 and s p 500 could enjoy a prolonged tailwind similarly gold may enjoy a modest boost from the continued injection of us dollars into the economy as it catches a bid on inflationary concerns cause for concern conversely the precious metal and us indices could fall under pressure if repo operations are unexpectedly terminated or the fed indicates rate hikes are necessary amid improving economic activity while there have been encouraging developments since september it is hard to deny the correlation between the fed s balance sheet expansion and the performance of the two asset classes especially us stocks which makes the threat of a change in fed policy concerning that being said it is exceedingly difficult to attribute specific gains to a single influence therefore it is unknown to what extent the stock market and gold will react when the fed ceases repurchase agreements but it is likely to be adverse mr powell hinted that they anticipate to adjust the size and pricing of these and eventually slow the pace of purchases over time with the dow jones nasdaq 100 and s p 500 trading near record levels after a commanding rally higher resistance to the topside is almost nonexistent barring a few trendline projections and prior highs it appears as though the three us indices are destined for even greater heights should the fundamental landscape remain

get my guide dow jones technical analysis in the case of the dow jones support will likely reside along the ascending trendline from the lows established in december 2018 throughout 2019 the technical level maintained varying degrees of influence a theme it should maintain until a serious break beneath is posted dow jones price chart secondarily a series of prior highs the 200 day simple moving

serious resistance apart from prior all time highs around 3 336 unlike the dow jones and nasdaq which enjoy a buffer between current prices and support the s p 500 finds itself suspiciously near an ascending channel should it break bears could look to drive prices lower as they attempt to test potential support around the psychologically significant 3 200 s p 500 price chart subsequent support may exist around the 3 100 area where an ascending trendline from december 2018 meets a trendline that coincides with various swing highs dating back to january 2018 gold technical analysis looking at

factual and precise in its submissions a major multilateral institution has delivered a bleak outlook on the nigerian economy in a damning verdict the african development bank notes that africa s largest economy will not make much improvement this year instead the continent s premier financial institution warns that some sectors of the economy are likely to remain in dire straits as in the preceding years which were plagued by low growth poverty and fluctuating income receipts to ward off this headwind the president major general muhammadu buhari retd and his economic team have to redouble their efforts and implement concrete strategies the afdb s africa economic outlook 2020 details the well known afflictions of the continent s economy meticulously it dissects the ills of the nigerian economy for both the federal and state governments in half or more than 18 of the 36 sub national governments the poverty rate is worse than the national average of 69 per cent the report avers this is not surprising despite the country being the ninth largest crude oil exporter in the world nigeria became the global capital of extreme poverty two years ago with about 94 million of its population surviving on 1 50 per day sadly with a dysfunctional economic model that is bereft of sound management things might not fare better high poverty reflects rising unemployment estimated at 23 1 per cent in 2018 up from 14 2 per cent in 2016 low skills limit opportunities for employment in the formal economy the afdb report says that is mortifying for the teeming youth it consolidates the bad news at that stratum unemployment underemployment is 55 4 per cent says the national bureau of statistics annually the education system injects millions more young people into the labour market with a faint hope that a significant percentage of them will be employed the federal government holds on tightly to the commanding heights of the economy unscientifically assuming that it can generate all the jobs in a telling instance this year 376 631 people applied for 220 vacant positions as the independent corrupt practices and other related offences commission decided to recruit government s best palliatives like n power and tradermoni fall significantly short of ameliorating the devastating joblessness noting that just three sectors transport oil and ict grew somewhat in 2019 the afdb states that the federal government spent more than 50 per cent of federally collected revenue on debt servicing in 2019 in one example the debt management office said debt servicing gulped 1 08 billion or n400 9 billion in the nine months to september 2019 obviously a high percentage of the remaining income went to servicing its huge recurrent expenditure that was n4 05 trillion that year agriculture which boosted the economy with 23 08 per cent to gdp in fourth quarter 2018 suffered a setback in 2019 because of flooding the boko haram menace and the herdsmen attacks on farmers manufacturing fared badly having no credit line to boost production or improve its contribution to gdp which was 1 1 per cent in 2018 inflation averaged 11 3 per cent consequently a gdp growth projection of 2 3 per cent for 2019 was just marginally higher than that of 2018 s 1 9 per cent besides as of june 2019 the country s debt profile stood at 83 9 billion that is 14 6 per cent higher than its 2018 level this debt jumped to 20 1 per cent of the gdp up from 17 5 per cent in 2018 the domestic component is far higher at 56 7 billion than the external public debt of 27 2 billion subject to parliamentary approval the federal government is about to negotiate another 22 7 billion loan and raid the pension funds for n2 trillion china will provide 17 billion of that staggering sum at a time it is paying highly to service the existing debts and its main source of income oil is unpredictable the economy might yet remain sluggish in addition a fiscal debacle is in the offing revenue is less than seven per cent to gdp at the federal level but the authorities after a prolonged agitation have just negotiated to increase the national minimum wage to n30 000 monthly from n18 000 oil prices are unstable and no diversified sources to fund this to defend the naira the central bank of nigeria depleted the foreign reserves by 4 47 billion in 2019 it means weak buffers with less income for the three tiers of government which largely comes from oil exports there are risks ahead consequently at the state level perhaps only lagos and oil rich rivers states can meet their financial commitments before the minimum wage upgrade more than 26 states owed salaries in all this the major response seems to be the finance act 2019 its principal pegs are the increase in vat from five to 7 5 per cent and more tax revenue yet the absence of a radical consciousness to transform the economy from its statist bent one that relies unwholesomely on sharing oil revenues is a major obstacle combined with the absence of fiscal federalism the peril ahead is real therefore the states must be liberated from the shackles of the federal government and become independent economic units they do not need to wait for the pittance at the end of the month from the centre fiscal federalism is the distinguishing mark of every federal state in the united states california state the world s sixth largest economy does not exist at the mercy of the federal government in washington dc but makes giant strides as an independent federating unit in the short term the regime should revive its economic management team refined petroleum imports are a massive drain on the economy instantaneously it should privatise the loss making refineries and produce a timeline to stop imports it should take a hard decision about the railway sector the private sector drives it in other economies nigeria should not be different instead of pouring scarce resources into it and the ajaokuta steel company the government should put them in private hands this will achieve the threefold purpose of bringing in fdi rebooting manufacturing and creating jobs currently there is a logjam in the power sector africa s largest economy produces below 5 000 megawatts of electricity that is abysmal buhari has been aloof in reworking the power sector he should revisit the crisis and personally intervene for there is no economy that can grow without a robust and cost effective power sector government has to intensify reforms and undertake a critical review of the executive orders it issued to jump start the economy with manual equipment in use operations have collapsed at the seaports in lagos causing revenue loss of over n80 billion since a system breakdown early this year this should not continue scanners and proper technology should be acquired and the necessary haulage infrastructure constructed the buhari regime should roll back red tape that burdens and stifles economic growth copyright

market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result first trust municipal cef income opportunity etf mcef and first trust cef income opportunity etf fcef invest in closed end funds cefs because the shares of cefs cannot be redeemed upon demand shares of many cefs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value

ever decrease or when mcef or fcef seeks to sell shares of a cef it can receive the nav for those shares mcef and fcef may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to the indirect use of leverage through their investment in cefs cefs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns an underlying cef that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in an underlying cef concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically an underlying cef may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in an underlying cef containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries an underlying cef may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market certain underlying cefs are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and zero coupon bond risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income zero coupon bond risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall because they do not pay interest on a current basis senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities certain of the fixed income securities held by certain underlying funds may not have the benefit of covenants which could reduce the ability of the issuer to meet its payment obligations and might result in increased credit risk income from municipal bonds held by an underlying cef could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that an mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when an underlying cef s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance an underlying cef s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by an underlying cef a fund s investment in cefs and etfs involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds income from the funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax certain underlying cefs may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by an underlying cef or at prices approximately the value at which an underlying cef is carrying the securities on its books the funds are classified as non diversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the funds may be more susceptible to a single

show caption advertisement feb 10 upi it s hardly surprising that if a democrat wins the white house taxes on wealthy americans and corporations will probably go up how they ll go up is the more interesting question advertisement the 2020 democratic presidential candidates generally agree the u s economy faces a variety of challenges record high income inequality decaying infrastructure failing public schools climate change that is leading to fires and floods and a lack of health insurance for millions of americans to name a few to remedy these problems every candidate has proposed raising government revenue by increasing taxes on the rich in one way or another whether through higher income tax rates a wealth tax or changing how investment income is treated here is a brief look at the tax plans of the top eight candidates in the polls and what economists like me think about them advertisement president donald trump s 2017 tax reform law reduced the top individual income tax rate from 39 6 percent to 37 percent every democratic candidate running to replace trump agrees that it should be raised most suggest returning it to 39 6 percent a few think it should go higher bloomberg proposes an additional 5 percent surcharge on income above 5 million yielding a 44 6 percent rate while vermont sen bernie sanders wants a top rate of 52 percent for taxes on lower and middle income americans the candidates generally say they plan to leave the current rates in place or lower them the candidates focus on taxing the wealthy because they say the richest americans have benefited greatly from u s tax policy in the recent past and are no longer paying their fair share the question that economists ask when assessing such policies is when do high tax rates have negative economic consequences such as by discouraging productive work because uncle sam takes such a big chunk of each extra dollar they earn the standard economic argument for lower marginal tax rates is that it provides incentives for people to work hard and be productive but it s not clear at what rate that happens and 37 percent does not seem to be the tipping point advertisement for perspective every year from 1940 to 1980 the top marginal tax rate was at least 70 percent yet productivity growth and economic growth were both robust over this period investment income a related issue is should investment income such as dividends capital gains and carried interest be taxed at a lower rate than labor income currently investment income is taxed at a top rate of 20 percent as opposed to the 37 percent tax on labor income with other rate differentials at lower incomes the democratic candidates all want to end the practice of taxing investment income at a lower rate than labor income i believe there are good reasons to do so as do many other economists primarily a lower tax rate incentivizes the wealthy to find ways to convert earnings from labor into capital income to reduce their tax bill and believe it or not private equity managers who typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year have all their earnings classified as capital income cutting their tax bill in half corporate income tax the 2017 trump tax bill also cut corporate taxes from 35 percent to 21 percent with proponents arguing it would spur business investment and economic growth advertisement several studies however found little or no evidence of this impact and the 2017 tax bill reduced corporate tax revenues as a share of gdp to 1 1 percent from the 50 year average of 1 9 percent putting a larger proportion of the tax burden on individuals this is why all the democratic candidates propose raising corporate tax rates some such as former vice president joe biden and minnesota sen amy klobuchar want to raise the rate some while others such as former mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren would restore the pre trump 35 percent rate similar to the individual tax finding the optimal corporate tax rate can be tricky generally speaking changes to corporate taxes have little impact on the u s economy so raising them shouldn t slow growth higher corporate taxes do however reduce stock prices since corporations will pay more money to the government and less to shareholders as dividends thereby reducing incentives to own stock shares this can hurt less wealthy americans with investments in retirement plans and mutual funds a wealth tax sanders and warren argue the super wealthy should pay even higher taxes to reduce inequality and to cover their bigger spending plans most americans agree advertisement warren wants to slap a 2 percent tax on net worth in excess of 50 million and a 3 percent tax on fortunes in excess of 1 billion sanders would go further he suggests a tax of 1 percent on net worth over 32 million that would get progressively higher rising to 8 percent on wealth over 10 billion economists are not huge wealth tax fans they think it would spark tax evasion and for this reason not likely lead to much additional revenue more than that a wealth tax may be unconstitutional even if congress were to pass such a tax it would immediately be challenged in the courts the supreme court would likely hold it unconstitutional as was the case with the individual income tax which required the 16th amendment to the u s constitution be passed before it could be implemented carbon tax carbon taxes are taxes on polluting activities such as the use of gasoline or electricity economists across the political spectrum tend to support taxing carbon because it creates incentives for consumers and businesses to spend money in ways that reduce carbon emissions and slow climate change advertisement it would however increase the cost of driving flying and heating one s home it would also increase the price of all goods transported long distances and whose production requires a good deal of energy this regressive side to the tax is why sanders doesn t support carbon taxes though most of the other candidates do as an example yang s 40 per ton tax would cost the average american family 2 000 a year besides helping the environment the entrepreneur says a carbon tax would help finance his basic income guarantee turning the page with few exceptions the democrats running for president seem to be on the same basic tax policy page they all want to raise more revenue by taxing capital income at the same rate as labor income and increasing rates on the wealthy and on corporations they differ over the extra taxes like on carbon wealth and financial transactions whatever combination of these tax changes might be enacted if a democrat wins the white house in 2020 and congress is controlled by the democrats the rich will likely

there was abundant federal securities litigation activity in 2019 plaintiffs not only continued to file securities lawsuits at record numbers but repeatedly secured victories in cases on significant issues of law the tone was set at the top with the supreme court s landmark decision in lorenzo v sec 1 there the supreme court clarified in contrast to its 2011 decision in janus capital group inc v first derivative traders 2 that a person who does not make a fraudulent misstatement can nonetheless be held primarily liable for securities fraud under section 10 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act and rule 10b 5 thereunder for his or her role in disseminating the misstatement in so ruling the supreme court effectively eviscerated a popular defense in fraud lawsuits since janus and reaffirmed that the antifraud provisions of the securities laws cover a wide range of conduct 3 in multiple other cases federal courts ruled in favor of plaintiffs and established expanded theories of liability for defendants for example in north sound capital llc v merck co 4 the third circuit held that plaintiffs who opt out of a securities class action are not precluded under the securities litigation uniform standards act of 1998 slusa from bringing state law fraud claims in follow on individual actions even if federal claims are time barred this opens a potentially significant new avenue for plaintiffs to evade heightened federal pleading standards and limitations periods the tenth circuit in sec v scoville 5 clarified that the sec and doj may avail themselves of the expansive conduct and effects test under the dodd frank act to reach securities fraud defendants whose u s based conduct affects foreign defendants or who commit frauds abroad that affect u s investors courts also adopted expansive views of a security subject to federal antifraud rules and registration requirements applying the concept to an internet traffic exchange service scoville and a new digital coin balestra v atbcoin llc 6 plaintiffs were particularly successful in achieving certification of classes asserting securities fraud claims in case after case courts certified classes where plaintiffs made a threshold showing that stock traded in an efficient market or the case primarily involved omissions of material fact in such cases courts broadly permitted plaintiffs to avail themselves of a presumption of class wide reliance on the fraud i e the basic and affiliated ute presumptions respectively and routinely rejected defendants efforts to rebut the presumption through competing expert opinions and statistical analyses purporting to sever the link between the fraud and plaintiffs losses in addition courts virtually shut the door on defendants efforts under the supreme court s 2013 decision in comcast corp v behrend 7 to defeat class certification by challenging plaintiffs ability to show class wide damages but 2019 was not a clean sweep for plaintiffs although courts routinely quashed efforts to defeat claims on procedural or technical grounds they balanced this pro plaintiff stance by closely scrutinizing evidence of fraud and dismissing claims outright in several significant cases relying on the common law concept of puffery the second circuit gross v gfi group inc 8 and singh v cigna corp 9 and the eleventh circuit carvelli v ocwen financial corp 10 rejected securities fraud claims on the basis that the alleged misstatements for example a commitment to compliance in a company s code of ethics were too general to be actionable and the southern district of new york tung v bristol myers squibb co 11 and first circuit metzler asset management gmbh v kingsley12 likewise demanded detailed factual allegations of defendants scienter intent to deceive and dismissed multiple suits for failure to establish a strong inference of scienter collectively these courts sent a clear message that the paramount question in a federal securities fraud suit is whether fraudulent conduct occurred if not cases will be dismissed from an enforcement perspective like last year the sec continued to focus on protecting retail investors and cyber issues overall the sec brought 862 total actions in fy 2019 526 of which were standalone actions brought in federal court or as administrative proceedings 13 while this was a slight increase over fy 2018 a significant number of the standalone actions 95 were brought as part of the share class disclosure initiative discussed below which involved self reported violations and an accelerated resolution process consistent with the agency s focus on retail investors there was a significant increase in enforcement actions brought against investment advisers and investment companies 191 total actions accounting for 36 of all actions compared to 108 and 22 in fy 18 and an increase in enforcement actions related to issuer disclosure and accounting issues up to 92 from 79 in fy 18 14 this past year was also a very active year for foreign corrupt practices act fcpa enforcement for the sec and the doj conversely there were large drops in the number of sec enforcement cases against broker dealers down to 38 from 63 in fy 18 and insider trading cases down to 30 from 61 in fy 18 15 we discuss these developments as well as our predictions for 2020 in more detail below i traits and trends the volume of federal securities fraud class action filings in 2019 remained at near record highs during 2019 plaintiffs filed 428 federal securities fraud class actions surpassing 2017 s record high of 413 this was nearly double the average number of filings over the past two decades there were more than 1 200 filings from 2017 to 2019 a number that accounts for nearly 25 of all of the filings in the more than 20 years since 1997 16 contributing to these high levels of filings were plaintiffs lawyers targeting new industries if 2017 and 2018 were the years of cryptocurrency filings which saw the emergence of suits targeting both established currencies and initial coin offerings 2019 may have been the year of cannabis litigation a notable number of putative class action suits were filed this year nearly all of which targeted canadian based companies that listed their shares on u s based exchanges following canada s 2018 legalization of cannabis related products 17 these suits mostly relied on time tested strategies claiming after the announcement of a downturn in performance or unexpected regulatory difficulties that the company s prior rosier disclosures were false or misleading they demonstrated however the extent to which an emerging industry can be fertile ground for putative class actions also responsible for some growth was an increase in parallel filings whether in both federal and state court or multiple state courts spurred by the supreme court s 2018 decision in cyan inc v beaver county employees retirement fund 18cyan held that securities class actions under the securities act of 1933 securities act can be brought in state court and are not removable to federal court where the private securities litigation reform act would provide for more robust procedures for consolidating parallel litigation from 2010 to 2017 there was an average of fewer than 6 parallel actions filed per year but in 2019 there were 22 together state and parallel filings constituted more than 75 of all 1933 act filings in 2019 19 despite the high overall volume of securities filings m a filings were somewhat soft in 2019 compared to recent years with filings falling from 182 in the prior year to 160 20included in this category were a broad range of suits challenging proposed transactions including claims targeting a board s sales process conflicts of interest among the directors and the adequacy of public disclosures 21 it was widely believed that the increase in such filings in 2017 and 2018 stemmed from the delaware court of chancery s 2016 decision in in re trulia inc stockholder litigation 22 which limited delaware s receptiveness to non monetary disclosure only settlements of actions challenging m a transactions from 2017 to 2019 the three years immediately following trulia the number of securities filings challenging m a transactions brought in federal court were more than five times higher than the average from 2009 to 2016 23 much of that growth was in the third circuit home to delaware which saw its m a filings skyrocket from an average of fewer than 10 between 2010 and 2016 to 127 in 2019 the third circuit in 2019 dwarfed the other circuits in m a filings compared to its127 filings all other circuits combined saw only 33 and the next largest circuit was the second circuit with 9 24 the decline seen in 2019 in m a filings may therefore reflect the federal courts steady adoption of trulia s approach in federal jurisprudence the case of house v akorn inc 25 is illustrative of this trend in that case the northern district of illinois rejected a proposed settlement in a putative class action challenging an impeding merger after the action was filed the target company amended its proxy statement to moot the plaintiffs disclosure based claims the plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their claims in exchange for attorney s fees based on the supposed benefit those disclosures conferred on the shareholders echoing trulia s skepticism of the value of such supplemental disclosures the court deemed the company s additional disclosures in this case to be worthless to the shareholders and exercised the court s inherent authority to reject the mootness fee settlement and order plaintiffs counsel to return the fee award to the company 26 the decision is currently on appeal to the seventh circuit 27 on the regulatory front the sec enforcement program continues to prioritize retail investor protection a particular area of focus is misconduct related to the interactions between investment professionals and investors this not only includes traditional retail cases such as ponzi schemes and microcap fraud but also cases against investment advisers and investment companies related to conflict of interests and the failure to adequately disclose fees and costs to investors as well as cases against broker dealers for excess commissions an example of this focus going forward is the enforcement division s teachers initiative in which the sec will be looking at the compensation and sales practices of third party administrators of teacher retirement plans often known as 403 b plans as well as the practices of their affiliated advisers and broker dealers for potential conflicts of interest 28 this past year was another busy year for cyber enforcement the sec brought a number of significant ico related enforcement actions related to digital assets including cases related to the proper registration of coin offerings and fraudulent icos chairman clayton has made it clear that the sec will stay active in this space and continue to scrutinize icos and other digital asset securities to ensure they comply with federal securities laws finally sec remedies for securities law violations were a hot topic in 2019 and will be in 2020 as we discuss further below the supreme court agreed to review a case that will likely decide whether the sec has the authority to seek disgorgement in enforcement actions it brings in federal court the sec also continues to look for ways to use remedies other than financial penalties to further its enforcement goals the sec brought a number of enforcement actions in 2019 where it required parties to comply with detailed undertakings to further the sec s remedial objectives and address the wrongdoing at issue and this trend will likely continue ii threshold issues in 2019 defendants frequently sought dismissal of securities actions at the pleadings stage arguing not that plaintiffs failed to allege fraudulent conduct but that the parties or the alleged conduct did not fall within the ambit of the federal securities laws in almost every such instance where a major issue of law was in dispute however courts rejected defendants efforts and affirmed the broad scope of the federal securities laws a who may be liable for securities fraud makers vs schemers in perhaps the most significant securities decision of the year the supreme court in lorenzo v sec 29 held that a person who does not make a fraudulent statement may nonetheless be held primarily liable under section 10 b of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 a and c for disseminating it in so ruling the court substantially diminished if not eliminating outright the relevance of its 2011 decision in janus capital group inc v first derivative traders 30 which held that a person who does not have ultimate authority over an alleged misstatement may not be held primarily liable under rule 10b 5 b in lorenzo the sec brought an administrative proceeding against francis lorenzo the vice president of an investment bank who allegedly emailed fraudulent statements to potential investors regarding the value of a company involved in a debenture offering the sec determined that lorenzo s actions violated section 17 a 1 of the securities act section 10 b of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 and imposed sanctions including a civil penalty and a lifetime industry bar relying on janus the d c circuit held that lorenzo did not have ultimate authority over the statements in his investor emails and so could not be held liable under rule 10b 5 b for making those statements the individual with ultimate authority was the employee s supervisor who not only supplied the content of the email messages but approved each message before it was sent 31 the court nevertheless concluded that even though the vice president did not make the misstatement he still could be held liable for his role in participating in the fraudulent scheme to send the emails under rule 10b 5 a or c 32 a 6 2 majority of the supreme court affirmed holding that even if a person does not make a misstatement the person s participation in disseminating the misstatement falls within the scope of other provisions rule 10b 5 33 writing for the majority justice breyer rooted the court s decision in the text of subsections a and c of rule 10b 5 which make it unlawful to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud and engage in any act practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or deceit 34 he words in these provisions are as ordinarily used sufficiently broad to include within their scope the dissemination of false or misleading information with the intent to defraud 35 lorenzo argued that the majority s rationale would render rule 10b 5 b which makes it unlawful o make any untrue statement of material fact or to omit to state a material fact superfluous because he argued subsections a and c of rule 10b 5 would cover the conduct prohibited by rule 10b 5 rather than a separate type of conduct 36 but the court rejected this argument explaining that the court and sec have long recognized considerable overlap among the subsections of and related provisions of the securities laws 37 as the court saw it congress intended to root out all manner of fraud in the securities industry and gave to the commission the tools to accomplish that job 38 in a dissenting opinion justice thomas cautioned that the majority s sweeping holding eviscerates janus and renders that decision a dead letter 39 according to justice thomas the majority s decision could subject individuals only tangentially involved in the misconduct like a secretary instructed to send a fraudulent email to private securities fraud liability which would abrogate the distinction between primary and secondary liability for which no private right of action exists under the federal securities laws 40 under lorenzo the focus of the inquiry becomes an individual s intent to defraud and active participation in a scheme or course of business designed to defraud rather than on whether the individual was responsible for making a fraudulent misstatement post lorenzo decisions have lent credence to justice thomas s concerns repeatedly holding that a defendant may be liable for securities fraud even if he or she did not have ultimate authority over and thus did not make an alleged misstatement in sec v weaver 41 for example the ninth circuit held that the defendant who did not make a misstatement could be liable under lorenzo because the undisputed facts show that own conduct contributing to the transaction or overall scheme had a deceptive purpose and effect 42 in multiple cases the southern district of new york also relied on lorenzo to sustain fraud claims on the pleadings despite the failure to allege a deceptive act that is distinct from misstatements holding that deceptive conduct alone is sufficient to expose a defendant to scheme liability under rule 10b 5 a and c 43 moreover although lorenzo only addressed claims under rule 10b 5 in malouf v sec 44 the tenth circuit held that it applies with equal force to claims under section 17 a 3 of the securities act which prohibits anyone from engag in any transaction practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser 45 in malouf the tenth circuit explained that lorenzo applies to such claims because section 17 a 3 is virtually identical to rule 10b 5 c 46 these decisions illustrate that as justice breyer observed in lorenzo section 10 b and rule 10b 5 capture a wide range of conduct 47 even if a misstatement is involved a defendant still may face primary liability for his or her participation in a fraudulent scheme involving the misstatement given lorenzo we expect fraud defendants to gradually stop invoking the janus based defense that they are not liable because they lacked ultimate authority over an alleged misstatement which had become increasingly popular and instead to turn their focus to testing the outer bounds of scheme liability b federal preemption congress has engaged in two major legislative efforts to curb perceived abuses in securities filings in 1995 congress passed the private securities litigation reform act pslra which imposed various procedural hurdles on section 10 b claims including for example dismissal of unsubstantiated suits without discovery sanctions for frivolous actions and safeharbors for certain forward looking statements 48 given the obstacles placed in front of federal securities plaintiffs by the pslra plaintiffs responded by refashioning such claims as state law fraud claims and filing such suits in state court where the pslra does not apply wherever possible to stem this practice and reassert federal control over such claims in 1998 congress passed the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa which amended portions of both the securities act and the exchange act to preempt covered class actions in state court and permit defendants to remove them to federal court 49 slusa preemption applies only to a covered class action where the plaintiff alleges a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or that the defendant used to employ any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security 50 a covered class action includes not only a single class action lawsuit but also any group of lawsuits i filed in or pending in the same court ii involving common questions of law or fact iii seeking damages for more than 50 persons and iv that are joined consolidated or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose 51 in north sound capital llc v merck co 52 the third circuit held that the slusa did not preclude plaintiffs who opted out of a class action from asserting state law fraud claims in follow on individual actions in that case a class action asserting fraud claims under sections 10 b 20 a and 20a was commenced in the district of new jersey alleging that merck and schering plough made misstatements concerning efficacy of two popular anti cholesterol drugs after the district court approved a class wide settlement and entered judgment certain plaintiffs who opted out of the class action brought individual actions asserting claims under the federal securities laws and for common law fraud under new jersey law after the plaintiffs federal claims were dismissed as time barred under the exchange act s five year statute of repose the district court held the state law fraud claims were preempted under the slusa 53 according to the district court congress envisioned the aggregation of opt out suits with related class actions under the slusa s mass action provisions 54 on appeal the third circuit disagreed with the district court s analysis and reinstated the opt out plaintiffs state law claims in rejecting a broad view of slusa preclusion the third circuit held that at a minimum suits do not proceed as a single action unless they are somehow combined for the joint management of a common stage of the proceedings such as discovery or the resolution of a common question of law and fact 55 the court explained that this interpretation is supported by congress repeated refusal including in the securities act the exchange act the pslra and the slusa itself to broadly preempt state law securities claims 56 it also comports with the fifth and fourteenth amendments under which every absent class member must be provided with an opportunity to opt out of a class action seeking predominantly damages in this case the court found that there was no coordination among the plaintiffs because plaintiffs suits and the prior class actions never existed at the same time 57 this was so even though the opt out plaintiffs actions were designated as related to the class action and their complaints were based nearly verbatim on the class action complaints 58 the third circuit s decision arguably runs contrary to the goals of the slusa under north sound capital a plaintiff who opts out of a class action may assert a state law securities fraud claim that is not subject to the federal pleading standards or notably federal limitations periods thus the decision unquestionably expands the scope of potential liability for securities fraud and incentivizes plaintiffs to opt out of securities class actions to assert state law claims perhaps the most notable aspect of the decision is that it permitted opt out plaintiffs to proceed with state law claims even as equivalent claims under federal law were time barred given the implications we expect plaintiffs to deploy the techniques of north sound capital more frequently and as a result for other courts of appeals and perhaps the supreme court to eventually weigh in on the issue c extraterritoriality in its 2010 decision in morrison v national australia bank 59 the supreme court established that plaintiffs cannot assert extraterritorial claims under section 10 b specifically the court held that these provisions apply only to i transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges and ii domestic transactions in other securities 60 while morrison has proved a boon for defendants in many cases in 2019 two key decisions refused to recognize defendants morrison based arguments first the supreme court left untouched a ninth circuit decision rejecting the second circuit s multi factor approach to the question of extraterritoriality under morrison in a 2014 decision in parkcentral global hub ltd v porsche automobile holdings se 61 the second circuit held that while a domestic transaction or listing is necessary to state a claim under 10 b a finding that these transactions were domestic would not suffice to compel the conclusion that the plaintiffs invocation of 10 b was appropriately domestic 62 according to the second circuit the facts of a case may demonstrate that claims are so predominantly foreign as to be impermissibly extraterritorial even if they involve a domestic transaction 63 in 2018 in stoyas v toshiba corp 64 the ninth circuit rejected the second circuit s approach explaining that the parkcentral test is contrary to section 10 b and morrison itself because it i ignores the broad language of rule 10 b ii speculates about congressional intent which morrison rebuke iii establishes an open ended under defined multifactor test akin to the vague tests criticized by morrison and iv relies heavily on the foreign location of the allegedly deceptive conduct which morrison held to be irrelevant 65 thus under stoyas a finding of a domestic transaction is not only necessary for antifraud liability it is also sufficient 66 on june 24 2019 the supreme court denied a petition for writ of certiorari seeking to resolve the circuit split on january 28 2020 following the supreme court s denial of certiorari the central district of california in stoyas sustained fraud claims arising from plaintiffs purchase of american depositary receipts adrs reflecting ownership of the common stock of toshiba corporation which trades on the tokyo stock exchange 67 citing plaintiffs allegations that they purchased the adrs through a broker in new york via the otc link trading platform based in new york and that transfer of title was recorded in citibank in new york the court held that plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that incurred irrevocable liability to take and pay for the adrs in the united states 68 accordingly the court held that plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged a domestic transaction under morrison to defeat a motion to dismiss 69 thus as it stands the ninth circuit and second circuit employ different approaches to the question of extraterritoriality in the ninth circuit any domestic transaction is subject to the antifraud provisions while in the second circuit even a domestic transaction may be beyond the reach of the federal securities laws depending on the results of a fact based assessment of the foreign nature of a transaction until the supreme court weighs in we expect plaintiffs asserting fraud claims with a foreign nexus to steer suits to the ninth circuit whenever possible second the tenth circuit clarified that morrison does not apply to securities fraud claims asserted by the sec or doj holding that the more expansive standards of section 929p b of the dodd frank act apply instead in sec v traffic monsoon llc 70 the sec brought a civil suit in the district of utah against traffic monsoon an internet traffic exchange business that sold adpacks of fake page views and advertisement click throughs to make a website appear more popular by artificially inflating its page views the sec alleged that traffic monsoon s adpacks sales constituted an illegal ponzi scheme in violation of section 10 b of the exchange act and 17 a of the securities act and sought a preliminary injunction freezing defendants assets and prohibiting defendants from continuing to operate the business in granting the requested preliminary relief the district court rejected defendants argument that the sec could not succeed on their claims under morrison because of the absence of domestic securities transaction holding that the conduct and effects test under section 929p b of the dodd frank act not morrison applies to the sec s claims under that test the sec may assert a claim for fraud based on 1 conduct within the united states that constitutes significant steps in furtherance of the violation or 2 conduct occurring outside the united states that has a foreseeable substantial effect within the united states 71 the tenth circuit affirmed on appeal the defendant argued that morrison not the conduct and effects test should apply to the sec s claims according to defendant congress did not clearly express its intent to override morrison s default rule because section 929p b is framed as a matter of jurisdiction in the dodd frank act while under morrison extraterritoriality is not jurisdictional but rather goes to the merits of a claim the tenth circuit rejected this argument explaining that it strains credulity to assume that congress consciously chose to enact section 929p b against the background of the fundamental shift in securities law brought about by morrison when morrison was issued in the midst of the legislative process and only a month after the dodd frank act was enacted into law 72 rather given the context and historical background surrounding congress s enactment of section 929p b congress undoubtedly intended that the substantive antifraud provisions should apply extraterritorially when the statutory conduct and effects test is satisfied 73 further the court found the requirements of the test to be met in this case because the defendant conceived and created the adpack scheme in the u s and promoted the adpack investments while residing in utah 74 the supreme court denied the defendant s petition for certiorari on november 4 2019 given the strength of the tenth circuit s reasoning we do not expect any serious challenge to the holding of scoville in other jurisdictions rather under section 929p b of the dodd frank act the sec and doj need only show that a fraud defendant engaged in substantial conduct in the united states or conduct that had an effect in the united states this gives the sec and doj a powerful tool to reach defendants that private litigants cannot when there is not a domestic securities transaction d what qualifies as a security by definition the securities laws apply only to securities whether an instrument is deemed a security will often turn on whether it qualifies as an investment contract under the securities act s definition of a security 75 the supreme court established the requirements for an investment contract in its 1946 decision sec v w j howey co 76 1 an investment 2 in a common enterprise 3 with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others 77 in two significant decisions in 2019 courts applied the howey test to find that investment vehicles involving new technologies qualified as securities in scoville discussed above the defendant contended that traffic monsoon s adpacks did not qualify as securities because the purpose of adpacks was to provide purchasers advertising for their websites by artificially inflating page views not to serve as an investment the tenth circuit rejected this argument reasoning that the vast majority of adpacks purchasers bought adpacks not to receive advertising services but instead to have the opportunity to share in traffic monsoon s revenue and earn significant returns 78 in addition the court disagreed with the defendant s contention that revenue is not solely derived by defendants efforts given that it also depends on purchasers clicking on each other s websites the court noted that the company s efforts were a significant factor since a purchaser could qualify to share revenue by spending only four minutes a day clicking on ads and the purchasers were primarily motivated by the chance to receive a return on their investment not the promise of receiving additional clicks on their website 79 in balestra v atbcoin llc 80 the southern district of new york held that cryptocurrency called an atb coin was an investment contract in considering whether the coin qualified as a security the court found that plaintiff alleged a common enterprise because the primary goal of the coin offering was to raise capital to create and launch a new blockchain that would deliver blazing fast secure and near zero cost payments to anyone in the world 81 according to the court this demonstrated that the funds raised through the ico were pooled together to facilitate the launch of the atb blockchain the success of which in turn would increase the value of plaintiff s atb coins 82 the court specifically observed that defendants launched a marketing campaign for atb coins that highlighted the potential profits that would result simply from holding those coins in press releases and on defendants website 83 these decisions demonstrate that courts will apply the 74 year old howey test which was originally developed in relation to the sale of tracts of a citrus grove to emerging forms of investments in the modern economy in particular balestra should dispel the notion that purveyors of increasingly popular cryptocurrencies are exempt from the securities laws and their registration requirements iii class certification an area where plaintiffs had almost across the board success in 2019 was class certification this is notable because class certification is often make or break for plaintiffs and defendants if a class is certified the potential damages a defendant faces rise astronomically which unsurprisingly often leads to settlement by contrast if certification is denied the leverage tips decidedly to the defendants against individuals who typically lack the resources or incentive to effectively litigate a complex securities case in 2019 as in past years much of the activity in class certification focused on the question of predominance under rule 23 b 3 of the federal rules of civil procedure plaintiffs have the burden of establishing that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members in order to achieve class certification 84 in numerous cases defendants argued that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that class members relied on fraudulent misstatements or omissions or could show that they suffered damages on a class wide basis in almost all instances defendants efforts failed a reliance on a class wide basis in theory plaintiffs have a significant challenge in establishing that common questions of reliance predominate on a class wide basis because in a large diffuse class each member may have a different story as to why he or she purchased a particular security some may have relied on public statements and disclosures some on price some on reputation of the company and so on to ease this burden and avoid a result where no mass securities fraud class actions can be certified the supreme court has established two presumptions of reliance that arise if certain conditions are satisfied first under the basic or fraud on the market presumption a plaintiff can invoke a presumption of reliance if he or she traded in securities of a company that made material misrepresentations to the public and whose securities are traded on an efficient market 85 subject to an opportunity for the defendant to rebut the presumption and defeat class certification by showing that the misrepresentations did not actually affect the price of the stock 86 second the court in affiliated ute articulated a presumption that plaintiffs may invoke if there is an omission of material fact by one with a duty to disclose 87 importantly the supreme court has explained that both presumptions may be rebutted at the class certification stage in which case class certification would be defeated specifically a defendant may rebut the presumption by sever the link between the alleged misrepresentation and either the price received or paid by the plaintiff or his decision to trade at a fair market price 88 for example a defendant could present evidence that the misrepresentation did not for whatever reason actually affect the market price or that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the stock even had he been aware that the stock s price was tainted by fraud 89 the lesson of cases involving the basic presumption in 2019 is if plaintiffs make a threshold showing of market efficiency entitling them to the presumption defendants will have an extremely difficult time rebutting it on class certification in roofer s pension fund v papa 90 for example plaintiffs sought certification of a class of investors in the stock of perrigo company plc which trades on both the new york stock exchange nyse and tel aviv stock exchange tase although defendants did not challenge the applicability of the basic presumption for the nyse class they argued that it had been rebutted by a showing that plaintiffs relied on information other than alleged misstatements including their own assessments the district of new jersey rejected this argument holding that defendants did not show that plaintiffs relied solely on other factors or that their reliance on such other factors outweighed their reliance on the stock s market price 91 in any event the court held that evidence of certain class members reliance would not defeat predominance because individual issues of reliance would not overwhelm the class 92 with respect to the tase class the court held that the market was efficient rejecting defendant s criticism of plaintiff s expert s event study which defendants asserted did not to account for changes in tase stock price that were tied to the u s markets a supposed sign of inefficiency 93 according to the court alleged deficiencies in the expert s event study were not enough to overcome other evidence of market efficiency such as over thirty investment firms that issued over 600 analyst reports covering perrigo s stock during the class period at least seventeen market makers for perrigo stock on the tase during the class period and the fact that perrigo filed an s 3 registration statement with the sec shortly before the class period 94 in monroe county employees retirement system v southern co 95 plaintiffs sought certification of a class of investors in the stock of the southern company which trades on the nyse the northern district of georgia found that the basic presumption applied based on evidence of the market s efficiency including high weekly trading volume significant analyst coverage market makers and a cause and effect relationship between release of unexpected company news and movements in stock price the court rejected defendants criticisms of plaintiff s expert s model expressly stating its disinclination to engage in a battle of the experts at this stage 96 defendants argued that they had rebutted the presumption due to plaintiffs expert s failure to find statistically significant stock price declines on certain dates of corrective disclosure the court explained however that this does not prove the absence of price impact f a price movement is not statistically significant one cannot rule out random volatility but neither can one rule out information as the cause of the price movement or at least a contributing factor 97 in villella v chemical and mining co of chile inc 98 plaintiffs sought certification of a class of investors in the stock of chemical and mining company of chile inc which trades on the nyse the defendants argued that the basic presumption did not apply based on plaintiffs expert s failure to establish that stock price movement on three of five release dates was statistically significant the southern district of new york rejected this argument holding that only some evidence of market efficiency was necessary and although plaintiff s expert s study evidence was imperfect it was sufficient to meet that standard 99 the court was also unpersuaded by another flaw in plaintiff s experts model that its changes in stock price one day were correlated with prices another day a sign of supposed inefficiency in contrast to its ruling that some evidence of efficiency was all that was required to qualify for the basic presumption the court held that some evidence of inefficiency was not enough to rebut it 100 thus villella clearly illustrates that where the basic presumption is at issue plaintiffs and defendants are not on equal footing plaintiffs have a lower evidentiary burden in vizirgianakis v aeterna zentaris inc 101 plaintiffs sought certification of a class of investors in the stock of aeterna zentaris inc which trades on the nyse the district of new jersey certified the class finding that the basic presumption applied on appeal defendants argued that they had rebutted the basic presumption because plaintiffs expert did not prove a price impact to a 95 confidence level 102 the third circuit rejected this argument holding that plaintiffs do not have a burden to prove price impact for class certification purposes and their failure to do so does not establish the opposite 103 the court also declined to find that the lower court had abused its discretion in weighing conflicting expert testimony at the class certification stage explaining that eighing conflicting expert testimony is a normal task of the district court at the certification stage 104 although not as frequently litigated plaintiffs had similar success in certifying a class under the affiliated ute presumption in gruber v gilbertson 105 for example plaintiffs sought to certify a class against various stakeholders of dakota plains holdings inc for securities fraud plaintiffs alleged that defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate the company s stock price while concealing that they had amassed a large equity stake in excess of 5 of the company to contest application of the affiliated ute presumption defendants argued that it was not primarily an omissions case because the company had made an affirmative misstatement in a form 8 k that no one in the company owned more than 5 of the company the southern district of new york rejected this argument holding that identification of certain representations alone does not make a case about misrepresentations the key in this case according to the court was that defendants did not disclose their specific equity stake 106 in addition the court rejected defendants effort to rebut the affiliated ute presumption by showing that corrective disclosures had no impact on the company s stock price the court explained that price impact relates to the materiality of the alleged omissions and an assessment of materiality is not appropriate at the class certification stage 107 in sum these cases show the difficulty defendants face in defeating class certification where a plaintiffs have presented some evidence of market efficiency or b the case involves primarily omissions courts have made clear that they will not closely scrutinize the evidence of market efficiency offered by plaintiffs or engage in a battle of the experts rather some evidence of efficiency is likely enough moreover in no significant decision this year did a court find defendants evidence of lack of price impact sufficient to rebut the presumption in consistently rejecting defendants price impact evidence these decisions are arguably inconsistent with the supreme court s 2011 decision in wal mart stores inc v dukes108 and 2013 decision in comcast corp v behrend109 discussed in the next section which directed district courts to conduct an in depth analysis into whether plaintiff has satisfied rule 23 prerequisites at the class certification stage even if those questions are implicated by the merits of plaintiffs claims in dukes the court emphasized that it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question and that certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied after a rigorous analysis that the prerequisites of rule 23 a have been satisfied 110 although lower courts frequently have relied on dukes and comcast to deny class certification in other contexts it is not clear that courts are applying the same rigorous analysis to market efficiency and price impact evidence at the class certification stage while it is still black letter law that defendants may defeat certification by severing the link between a misrepresentation and stock price it remains an open question how this may be accomplished in practice given the high burden that courts have placed on defendants despite these difficulties and lack of track record of success we expect defendants to continue to try given the stakes b damages on a class wide basis in its 2013 decision comcast corp v behrend 111 the supreme court held that a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in class action must measure only those damages attributable to theory 112 the court explained that f the model does not even attempt to do that it cannot possibly establish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire class for purposes of rule 23 b 3 113 on that basis the court denied class certification for antitrust claims where an expert s model assumed the validity of all four theories of antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents and therefore failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which petitioners liability is premised 114 while defendants have frequently raised a comcast defense in opposing certification in securities class actions these efforts have rarely succeeded and 2019 was no exception in in re snap inc securities litigation 115 defendants opposed certification of securities fraud claims by arguing that plaintiffs failed to show that damages are capable of measurement on a class wide basis the central district of california disagreed finding that the theory of price inflation that undergirds damages model for the section 11 claims is expressly linked to his proposed model for calculating section 10 b damages and the expert s damages model under section 10 b relies on an event study where an expert estimates company specific price movement caused by other factors such as overall market conditions or dissemination of other material but non fraudulent information relayed by the company 116 the court further noted that the expert s report describes how an event study would enable him to assess price inflation in snap s stock and describes how the five alleged corrective partial disclosures during the class period would be analyzed using that methodology to determine how potential price inflation was impacted by each round of corrective disclosures 117 in roofer s pension fund v papa 118 discussed above the district of new jersey also rejected a comcast defense holding that the lead plaintiff s proposal to determine price inflation on each day during the class period and to use that information to determine damages based on individual class members trading activity satisfied the predominance requirement and was consistent with the lead plaintiff s theory of liability 119 casting doubt on whether comcast may ever be raised in a securities class action the court pointed out that the third circuit has explicitly cautioned that comcast s damages predominance analysis was specific to the antitrust claim at issue 120 the court further explained that even if comcast were to apply the proposed damages model was sufficient because it did not fail to measure damages resulting from the particular injury on which liability in this action is premised 121 likewise in monroe county employees retirement system v southern co 122 the northern district of georgia rejected a comcast challenge to plaintiffs expert s damages methodology the court explained that nothing in rule 23 b requires plaintiffs to prove predominance separately as to both liability and damages 123 the court articulated a plaintiff friendly two step inquiry into the damages calculation at the certification stage f damages cannot be ascertained by a methodology applicable to all class members the court must then consider whether questions of individual damages overwhelm the questions of liability that are subject to common proof 124 in light of this standard the court held that plaintiffs inexact description of their proposed damages calculations was a sufficient articulation of a class wide damages model to warrant certification 125 finally in gruber v gilbertson 126 the southern district of new york rejected defendants argument under comcast that plaintiffs expert s damages methodology did not match plaintiffs theory of liability according to defendants gruber s expert makes a faulty assumption that class members would not have purchased the stock had they known the information defendants omitted and different plaintiffs would have relied on different omissions before making purchases 127 the court however dismissed these arguments as miss the point because he damages model is generally the same inflated price minus actual price across all plaintiffs 128 the court further explained that while the damages calculation may be individualized for each plaintiff that does not necessarily mean that individual issues will overwhelm the issues common among the class 129 in short in 2019 comcast defenses were not fruitful for securities defendants opposing class certification and that likely will not change absent further guidance by courts of appeals or the supreme court iv theories of fraud while many important decisions favored plaintiffs in 2019 one area where defendants found some success was in dismissing fraud claims on the merits to state a claim under section 10 b of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 a plaintiff must plead 1 a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant 2 scienter 3 a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security 4 reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission 5 economic loss and 6 loss causation 130 these elements are coupled with heightened pleading standards including the requirement under rule 9 b of the federal rules of civil procedure that fraud claims be pled with particularity and the mandate under the pslra that the complaint establish a strong inference of scienter in 2019 courts were willing to closely scrutinize plaintiffs allegations of fraud and dismiss claims outright when they did not suffice under these standards a material misrepresentations vs mere puffery the first element of a section 10 b claim whether a material misrepresentation or omission occurred was litigated frequently in 2019 the question often was not whether someone made a misrepresentation but whether the misrepresentation was material that is whether there is a substantial likelihood that it would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available 131 where courts categorized the alleged misrepresentation as mere puffery a generic expression of corporate optimism that is immaterial as a matter of law they dismissed the claims in carvelli v ocwen financial corp 132 the eleventh circuit accepted a puffery defense for the first time in the securities fraud context there the puerto rico retirement system asserted violations of sections 10 b and 20 a of the exchange act against ocwen financial corporation a mortgage servicer it alleged that ocwen materially misled investors about the likelihood that ocwen would achieve regulatory compliance with certain state and federal laws governing the mortgage servicing process the southern district of florida dismissed the complaint holding that each of the alleged misrepresentations was immaterial puffery exempt forward looking statements or not sufficiently alleged to have been false the eleventh circuit affirmed because section 10 b prohibits untrue statements of a material fact the court reasoned that a puffery defense is a particularly good fit in the securities context 133 as such the court held that ocwen s alleged misrepresentations including statements that the company had continued to devote substantial resources to regulatory compliance felt good about progress towards compliance and had taken a leading role to stabilize communities affected by the financial crisis were immaterial puffery insufficient to constitute securities fraud 134 likewise the second circuit affirmed dismissal of section 10 b claims on a theory of puffery in two cases in gross v gfi group inc 135 plaintiffs alleged that a corporation s chairman materially misrepresented the value of a proposed merger by stating that the proposal represented a singular and unique opportunity to return value 136 the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment holding that while a reasonable juror could find the chairman s statement qualified as a material misrepresentation the investors failed to adduce evidence that defendants acted with scienter or that their economic losses were foreseeably caused by the misstatement on appeal the second circuit agreed with the result but disagreed that the statement was material the court held that the statement which was made without any elaboration or contextual cabining of what a singular or unique transaction means amounted to no more than a generic endorsement of the proposed merger that no investor would reasonably rely upon 137 similarly in singh v cigna corp 138 the second circuit held that generic statements in a corporation s code of ethics could not serve as the basis for a securities fraud claim there plaintiffs alleged that cigna misrepresented in its code of ethics and various sec filings that it had established policies and procedures and allocated substantial resources towards achieving regulatory compliance when in fact cigna had received over 75 notices of compliance violations from the centers for medicare and medicaid services in a one year period the district of connecticut granted cigna s motion to dismiss holding that the alleged misrepresentations were mere puffery on appeal the second circuit affirmed explaining that the alleged misstatements were textbook examples of general statements about reputation integrity and compliance with ethical norms that are too general to cause a reasonable investor to rely upon them 139 the court thus rejected plaintiffs creative attempt to recast corporate mismanagement as securities fraud 140 seizing on the second circuit s holding in singh defendants raised puffery defenses in two subsequent southern district of new york securities fraud cases but with opposite results in schiro v cemex s a b de c v 141 a putative class of investors claimed that a multinational building materials company cemex materially misled investors by claiming in its sec filings and internal code of ethics that the company reject corruption and was committed to conducting business with transparency and integrity while simultaneously paying bribes in connection with several construction projects in colombia 142 relying on singh the schiro court held that cemex s statements are classic puffery because they unmistakably signal that they were statements about goals not statements of fact 143 conversely in in re signet jewelers ltd securities litigation 144 a different southern district of new york judge rejected a singh defense and held that alleged misrepresentations contained in a jeweler s code of conduct were actionable according to the class action complaint in order to assuage investor fears following a 2008 sex discrimination suit which had alleged that signet suffered from rampant sexual harassment signet misrepresented in its code of conduct that i it made hiring decisions solely on the basis of merit ii discipline misconduct iii provided employees a means to report sexual harassment and iv required its executives to engage in honest and ethical conduct 145 the court rejected signet s argument that singh created a bright line rule that statements in a corporation s code of conduct are per se immaterial puffery holding that determining whether certain statements constitute puffery entails looking at context in which the statements are made 146 because a reasonable investor concerned about grave allegations concerning rampant sexual misconduct from that prior lawsuit could have relied on signet s assurances that it did not in fact have a toxic workplace the court determined that the complaint sufficiently pleaded an actionable misrepresentation 147 in view of these decisions and the affirmation of two courts of appeals a puffery defense likely will remain a powerful and popular defense in securities fraud lawsuits if a statement is deemed too generic to be material then a securities fraud lawsuit will be stymied at the outset nevertheless as the signet court stated there is no bright line rule between non actionable puffery and a material misstatement or omission rather it will depend on the context and the allegations given the success of the defense in 2019 we expect it to be more frequently litigated in 2020 and courts to provide further guidance on the line between a material misstatement and mere puffery b scienter in addition to a material misstatement or omission a plaintiff asserting violations of section 10 b and rule 10b 5 must establish that the defendant acted with scienter that is an intent to deceive to plead scienter the complaint must with respect to each act or omission state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind 148 a strong inference is more than merely plausible or reasonable it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of non fraudulent intent 149 scienter was fertile ground for dismissal in 2019 in metzler asset management gmbh v kingsley 150 plaintiffs alleged that biogen inc and its executives made misleading statements about the company s business prospects and the safety of tecfidera its leading multiple sclerosis drug the district of massachusetts dismissed the claims on scienter grounds 151 on appeal to the first circuit the plaintiffs argued that they established a strong inference of scienter with respect to two categories of misstatements statements pertaining to tecfidera s safety profile and statements pertaining to tecfidera s usage rate 152 regarding the first category the first circuit found that even if the statements were plausibly misleading the complaint failed to allege that the statements were made with the intent to deceive investors 153 regarding the second category of misstatements the court ruled against plaintiffs because the status of the discontinuation rates was disclosed to investors and the plaintiffs failed to identify any allegations in the complaint that show that anyone in the company had knowledge regarding the drug s safety profile and sales that contradicted the company s public representations 154 accordingly the court affirmed dismissal of the claims similarly in tung v bristol myers squibb co 155 the second circuit held that a complaint failed to adequately allege scienter in accordance with the controlling standard in the second circuit 1 that defendants had the motive and opportunity to commit fraud or 2 strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness 156 in tung plaintiffs brought claims under sections 10 b and 20 a of the exchange act alleging that the defendants had made public statements overstating the likelihood of success of a clinical trial for bristol myers s newest anticancer drug 157 plaintiffs claimed to identify two motives supporting a strong inference of scienter first the motive to protect competitively sensitive information and second the motive to sell stock while the price was artificially inflated as a result of the defendants alleged misstatements 158 the second circuit rejected the first as insufficient holding that the protection of proprietary information is quintessence of a generalized business motive that does not satisfy the pslra s pleading standard 159 as to the second the court held that such a motive can be established at the pleadings stage only if laintiffs first demonstrate that the stock sales were unusual or suspicious and here the court viewed the plaintiffs allegations wholly inconsistent with the fact that defendants had actually increased not reduced their stock holdings during the class period 160 in schiro v cemex s a b de c v moreover the southern district of new york held that allegations that the ceo of a subsidiary of cemex resigned on the same day that cemex disclosed that it had made a misrepresentation in its public filings were insufficient to establish a strong inference of scienter although noting that a resignation can raise an inference of scienter where it is highly unusual and suspicious the schiro court found that the complaint failed to even remotely suggest that the ceo s conduct rose to this level 161 rather the competing non culpable inference raised by the ceo s resignation an acknowledgement that the ceo was negligent in overseeing the responsible employees or thought that the optics of changing management would reassure investors and regulators was more plausible than an inference that the ceo knowingly or recklessly misled investors 162 in any event the court held that the subsidiary s ceo was one or two rungs below senior management and thus any scienter on the part of the ceo could not be attributed to cemex 163 a counterpoint to these decisions was the southern district of new york s decision in in re barclays liquidity cross and high frequency trading litigation 164 there a group of investors sought class certification in an action asserting violations of section 10 b against seven stock exchanges the plaintiffs alleged that the exchanges developed products and services that were sold to high frequency trading hft firms and the hft firms then used the exchanges technology to employ manipulative schemes at investors expense the plaintiffs claimed that the exchanges failed to fully disclose how hft firms might be able to use certain products and services on the exchanges trading platforms an omission which the plaintiffs alleged induced them to fall victim to the hft firms 165 according to the complaint the exchanges developed complex order types knowing that those order types would permit the hft firms to exploit investors then aligned their interests with the hft firms after realizing the exploitative potential of their services 166 taking these allegations collectively the court found that the investors raised a cogent and compelling inference that the exchanges acted with scienter 167 although the exchanges countered that the circumstantial evidence supported the plausible alternative inference that they acted to increase their profits not to commit fraud the court rejected this argument holding that the competing inference of a mere profit motive is not enough to defeat the inference of scienter because profit is the goal of any financial fraud 168 few lessons can be drawn from these cases except the fact driven nature of the scienter inquiry clearly a plaintiff must advance allegations that go beyond general claims of intent and motive but what constitutes a strong inference is open to interpretation on a case by case basis since a decision on scienter can be case dispositive litigants should pay close attention to this element at all stages of a fraud lawsuit c loss causation loss causation describes the causal link between the alleged misconduct and the economic harm ultimately suffered by the plaintiff 169 as the supreme court explained in dura pharmaceuticals inc v broudo 170 at the pleadings stage a plaintiff s allegations must provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind 171 in mineworkers pension scheme v first solar inc 172 the ninth circuit considered the following certified question from the district of arizona hat is the correct test for loss causation in the ninth circuit can a plaintiff prove loss causation by showing that the very facts misrepresented or omitted by the defendant were a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff s economic loss even if the fraud itself was not revealed to the market or must the market actually learn that the defendant engaged in the fraud and react to the fraud itself 173 the ninth circuit rejected the more restrictive view of the test explaining that loss causation is a context dependent inquiry as there are an infinite variety of ways for a tort to cause a loss 174 thus the court held that a plaintiff may prove loss causation by showing that the stock price fell upon the revelation of an earnings miss even if the market was unaware at the time that fraud had concealed the miss 175 on august 6 2018 the defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of the case to consider whether loss causation may be established absent a showing that the event that triggered that decline did not reveal the alleged fraud on june 24 2019 the supreme court denied certiorari we do not believe the ninth circuit s decision will be of great importance in securities lawsuits even under the test it likely will be difficult if not impossible for plaintiffs to show the necessary causal link between fraud and loss if the fraud itself is not revealed to the market indeed the supreme court s decision in dura suggests that such a corrective disclosure is required to state a securities fraud claim holding that the complaint was insufficient because it did not claim that dura s share price fell significantly after the truth became known 176 v securities enforcement a asset management the sec s continued focus on retail investors led to significant enforcement activity against asset managers much of this activity resulted from the sec s share class selection disclosure initiative scsd initiative the sec announced the scsd initiative in february 2018 under the initiative the division of enforcement agreed to recommend favorable settlement terms including no civil penalties to firms that self reported failures to disclose conflicts of interest associated with the selection of fee paying mutual fund share classes when a lower or no cost share class of the same mutual fund was available 177 the initiative led to the sec filing two series of enforcement actions in 2019 resulting in 95 investment advisory firms being ordered to return over 135 million to mutual fund investors in 2019 the majority of whom were retail investors 178 the sec stepped up its enforcement of investment advisers failure to disclose conflicts of interest outside the scsd initiative as well the sec brought an enforcement action against an investment adviser for failing to disclose material conflicts of interest in connection with revenue sharing agreements pertaining to mutual fund transactions 179 according to the sec commonwealth equity services did not sufficiently disclose to its clients that it received hidden material economic benefits on certain fund investments it selected for clients and failed to disclose that there were other funds for which the adviser did not receive any revenue sharing and thus had an incentive not to select although commonwealth had disclosed that certain of its arrangements with the clearing broker may create a conflict of interest the sec alleged that the adviser received over 135 million in revenue sharing payments over a period of approximately 4 1 2 years which amounted to an actual not merely potential conflict of interest in addition to fiduciary duty and disclosure violations the sec alleged that commonwealth violated the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act by failing to adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent fiduciary duty and disclosure violations the litigation is ongoing continuing the trend the sec brought enforcement proceedings against two investment advisers for allegedly failing to disclose conflicts of interest concerning a retail investment advisory program they advised 180 the sec found that bmo harris financial advisors and bmo asset management units of bank of montreal failed to disclose two material conflicts of interest dating back to 2012 first the sec found that between july 2012 and march 2016 the investment advisers invested almost 50 of client assets in proprietary mutual funds despite the availability of lower cost alternatives which resulted in additional fees without disclosing this conflict to investors second the sec found that from 2012 through 2015 bmo harris financial advisers invested client assets in higher cost share classes of mutual funds when lower cost share classes were available this resulted in the investment adviser receiving compensation pursuant to revenue sharing agreements that it would not have received if other classes had been selected in a settlement with the commission the bmo entities agreed to pay a civil penalty and disgorgement totaling over 37 million b broker dealers while the number of enforcement actions against broker dealers was down overall the sec brought a number of significant cases in the second half of 2019 in december the sec brought an enforcement action against two broker dealers for tendering a number of shares greater than their net long positions in a partial tender offer for shares of common stock 181 the sec alleged that the broker dealers violated rule 14e 14 of the exchange act the short tender rule by separately tendering 75 000 shares and 50 000 shares in excess of each broker dealer s net long position the sec order found that because the partial tender offer was oversubscribed the broker dealers caused the company to accept more shares from them and fewer from other participants as a part of the settlement the broker dealers agreed to be censured cease and desist from future violations of rule 14e 14 pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty the sec also brought a series of settled enforcement actions against broker dealers for improperly obtaining the pre release of american depositary receipts adrs adrs are securities that represent foreign shares and require a corresponding number of foreign shares to be held in custody at a depositary bank the sec actions alleged that the settling broker dealers improperly borrowed pre released adrs from other brokers when they should have known that those brokers did not own sufficient foreign shares to support the adrs 182 the sec found that the broker dealers violated section 17 a 3 of the securities act and failed to supervise their employees with a view to preventing and detecting violations of the securities laws under section 15 b 4 e of the exchange act the sec has brought 14 of these actions dating back to 2018 broker dealers were not immune from the sec s focus on protecting retail investors in september the sec brought a settled enforcement action against three raymond james entities for charging excessive fees and commissions on retail accounts 183 this included allegations that a raymond james broker dealer made unsuitable recommendations to retail investors that they sell certain unit investment trusts uits before their maturity and buy new uits which resulted in greater sales commissions than would have been charged had the investors held the uits to maturity as a part of the settlement the broker dealer agreed to be censured cease and desist from future violations of sections 17 a 2 and 17 a 3 of the securities act pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty c cyber and digital assets this was another busy year for cyber enforcement particularly related to initial coin offerings icos and digital currency the sec brought a number of cases against companies for conducting icos without filing registration statements with the commission including two cases which are currently being litigated 184 the threshold issue in these cases is whether the coins at issue qualify as securities under the howey test and therefore should have been registered with the sec in june the sec sued kik interactive inc for allegedly selling digital tokens to investors as part of a 100 million securities offering without registering their offer and sale 185 according to the complaint filed in the southern district of new york kik raised more than 55 million by selling tokens to wealthy investors at a discounted price in support of its argument that the tokens are securities and should have been registered the sec alleged that kik marketed the token as an investment opportunity that demand would drive the price of the tokens up and that kik would spur that demand by developing services and systems to reward companies that adopted the token but that none of the services or systems existed at the time the tokens were sold the sec further alleged that kik claimed that the tokens would immediately trade on the secondary market the complaint charges kik with violating section 5 of the securities act kik disputes the sec s allegations and the litigation is ongoing similarly in october the sec filed an emergency action in the southern district of new york and obtained a temporary restraining order against telegram group inc and its subsidiary ton issuer inc preventing the companies from continuing an alleged unregistered digital token offering 186 according to the sec s complaint telegram and ton began raising capital in january 2018 to finance the companies business and sold approximately 2 9 billion digital tokens called grams at discounted prices the sec alleged that telegram promised to deliver the grams to the initial purchasers upon the launch of its blockchain by no later than october 31 2019 at which time the purchasers and telegram will be able to sell billions of grams into u s markets the sec claims that grams are securities and defendants failed to register their offers and sales of grams in violation of the registration provisions of the securities act telegram and ton dispute the sec s allegations and the litigation is ongoing the sec has also been aggressive in policing fraud related to digital currency in june the sec added fraud allegations to a previously filed enforcement action against a cryptocurrency company and its ceo for allegedly conducting a fraudulent public offering 187 the sec alleged that longfin made false representations to the sec to qualify for a public offering and then fraudulently distributed shares to insiders and affiliates to meet nasdaq requirements without being paid for the shares and misrepresented the number of qualifying shareholders and number of shares sold in the offering the complaint also alleges that longfin and its ceo engaged in an accounting fraud by recognizing sham income in december the sec charged a digital asset company and its founder with defrauding investors in an ico that raised more than 42 million 188 according to the complaint filed in the southern district of new york uniteddata inc d b a shopin and its founder lied to investors in connection with the offering including making misrepresentations about supposed partnerships with well known retailers and about the involvement of a prominent entrepreneur the sec charged shopin and its founder with violations of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws the litigation is ongoing d insider trading while the number of sec insider trading cases decreased substantially there were significant developments in criminal cases last year and federal legislation that passed the house of representatives could revamp insider trading law if enacted sdny vacates insider trading plea and resuscitates newman the second circuit s amended opinion in martoma ii resurrected at least a portion of newman by vacating the express abrogation of that decision s meaningfully close personal relationship requirement when a tipper conveyed mnpi to a tippee as a gift 189 despite the apparent limited application of newman one aspect of newman remained on solid legal ground a remote tippee could be liable for insider trading only if 1 the tipper received a personal benefit and 2 the defendant knew the tipper disclosed mnpi in exchange for a personal benefit on june 21 2019 the southern district of new york vacated a guilty plea of former investment analyst richard lee who had pled guilty to insider trading after obtaining and trading on information from corporate tippers 190 lee moved to withdraw the plea in 2017 contending there was no evidence that lee knew of any personal benefit the insiders received for divulging confidential information the southern district of new york agreed vacating lee s guilty plea and proving newman s lasting force second circuits holds that no personal benefit required for criminal insider trading cases brought under title 18 in late december 2019 the second circuit issued its opinion in united states v blaszczak191 and held that the personal benefit test does not apply in all insider trading cases the government has traditionally brought insider trading cases as violations of the general antifraud provisions found in section 10 b of the exchange act title 15 of the us code a long line of insider trading cases dirks newman salman and martoma have required proof of a direct or indirect personal benefit to the tipper to establish liability recently some criminal prosecutors have brought insider trading cases as violations of the criminal wire fraud and or securities fraud statutes under title 18 of the u s code in addition to charging violations of section 10 b of the exchange act arguing that the personal benefit requirement does not apply to charges brought under title 18 192 the blaszczak case involved allegations that two hedge funds illegally traded on mnpi regarding medical treatment reimbursement rates they received from a consultant blaszcak who got the tip from a friend who worked at the centers for medicare and medicaid services in addition to violations of section 10 b the prosecutors charged defendants with violations of sections 641 conversion 1343 wire fraud and 1348 securities fraud under title 18 at trial the jury acquitted the defendants on the section 10 b charges but convicted them of violations of title 18 on appeal the defendants argued that their wire fraud and securities fraud convictions under title 18 should be overturned because the district court did not apply dirks and require the government to prove that the cms employee received a personal benefit for tipping the information in a split decision the second circuit affirmed the convictions and held that the personal benefit requirement does not apply to the title 18 wire fraud and securities fraud statutes 193 the second circuit s decision broadens criminal prosecutors power in insider trading cases while decades of case law has established that the government must prove a personal benefit in section 10 b cases prosecutors may now convict a defendant under other criminal statutes without proving that the tipper of mnpi received a personal benefit in exchange for that information as the mixed verdicts in blaszczak demonstrate this lower burden can be crucial to the outcome in certain cases it remains to be seen whether prosecutors will now charge defendants with securities fraud and wire fraud in insider trading cases with less than overwhelming evidence of a personal benefit but company employees and others with access to mnpi should be on notice about the potentially increased risk of prosecution federal legislators look to codify rules on insider trading meanwhile confusion and controversy over the legal standard required to prove insider trading spurred momentum on capitol hill in the form of the proposed insider trading prohibition act as originally drafted the act eliminated the personal benefit test and permitted the doj and sec to bring charges against anyone who was aware consciously avoided being aware or recklessly disregarded that mnpi was wrongfully obtained or communicated however the version passed by the house requires that a tipper receive a direct or indirect personal benefit the act s latest version will likely reignite debate over the meaning of personal benefit and potentially stymie any momentum as it goes to the senate for consideration e disclosure cases several matters in 2019 demonstrate the sec s commitment to pursuing public companies for disclosure and internal controls violations in particular the sec s settlements with facebook and mylan illustrate that issuers must continually revisit their disclosures including risk factor disclosures to ensure that they appropriately reflect material developments the actions also demonstrate that the sec is focused on companies with internal controls that fail to ensure that information regarding material developments reaches the individuals responsible for drafting and approving disclosures similarly the sec s settlement with fiat highlights that issuers should have internal controls that reasonably assure that key performance indicators are accurately reported in july the sec announced a 100 million settlement with facebook to resolve charges that the company made misleading risk factor disclosures 194 the sec alleged that facebook s risk factor disclosures in 2016 and 2017 presented misuse of user data as a hypothetical risk when facebook knew that user data had in fact been misused according to the sec s complaint facebook discovered by december 2015 that a researcher had improperly sold user information to data analytics firm cambridge analytica but facebook did not correct its existing risk factor disclosure for more than two years instead facebook continued to inform investors that user data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed the complaint further alleged that facebook reinforced its misleading disclosures in 2017 when it falsely told news reporters who were investigating cambridge analytica s use of data that it had discovered no evidence of wrongdoing the settlement also resolved charges that facebook s internal controls around the drafting of its reports on forms 10 k and 10 q including but not limited to its risk factor disclosures failed to bring the researcher s misuse of user data to the attention of the individuals with primary responsibility for drafting and approving those reports according to the complaint facebook identified trends and events for possible disclosure through a series of quarterly meetings to prepare for the company s earnings announcements several employees who attended those meetings were aware of the researcher s misuse including individuals from facebook s legal policy and communications groups but the incident was never discussed for the purpose of disclosure the complaint further alleged that facebook failed to share information regarding the incident with its independent auditors or outside disclosure counsel in order to assess its disclosure obligations in september the sec announced a 30 million settlement with mylan n v to resolve similar charges that the pharmaceutical company made misleading risk factor disclosures and failed to properly disclose or accrue loss contingencies in connection with a two year doj probe 195 according to the sec s complaint mylan was informed in october 2014 by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms that its largest revenue and profit generating product epipen was misclassified under the medicaid drug rebate program 196 several mylan executives and in house counsel including those involved in the preparation and review of mylan s public disclosures as well as external counsel participated in the october 2014 call during which a cms director stated that epipen was misclassified shortly thereafter doj opened a civil investigation into possible false claim act fca violations resulting from epipen s misclassification mylan ultimately agreed to pay 465 million to resolve fca liability the sec alleged that despite cms s statements regarding misclassification mylan s risk factor disclosures in its 2014 and 2015 annual reports misleadingly stated as a hypothetical that a governmental authority may take a contrary position on the company s medicaid submissions the sec also alleged that mylan failed to disclose or accrue any loss contingency in connection with doj s fca investigation until the company announced a settlement in principle in october 2016 the sec alleged that a number of factors including the existence of a tolling agreement and a presentation by mylan on the question of damages should have put mylan on notice that it was required to disclose the investigation and to take a provision for losses under generally accepted accounting principles finally the sec alleged that mylan failed to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to disclose and accrue for the loss associated with the doj investigation although mylan required quarterly discussions of significant contingencies by its financial and legal teams certain members of the financial team evaluating the loss contingency relating to mylan s epipen classification were not informed of developments concerning the progress of doj s investigation accordingly cases like mylan are instructive on when companies should disclose a government investigation and flag known risks and processes and procedures around disclosure companies should ensure that material information is identified and provided to the proper individuals who should be made aware of the circumstances giving rise to sec violations even if disclosure is not warranted on the same day as the mylan settlement the sec announced a 40 million settlement with fca us llc and its parent company fiat chrysler automobiles n v collectively fiat to resolve charges that the automaker misled investors about the number of new vehicles sold each month to customers in the united states 197 according to the sec order between 2012 and 2016 fiat issued monthly press releases that were included in sec filings falsely reporting new vehicle sales and falsely touting a streak of uninterrupted monthly year over year sales growth the sec order found that fiat inflated new vehicle sales by paying dealers to report fake vehicle sales and maintaining a database of actual but unreported sales often referred to as a cookie jar the sec claimed that fiat was aware of the fake sales reporting concerns having been raised by internal audit and by ethics hotline complaints and the issue having been internally investigated notwithstanding the complaints and internal investigation fiat continued to report the false sales figures the sec order also found that with respect to fiat s cookie jar of unreported sales the company did not have in place internal controls that could reasonably ensure that new vehicle sales were recorded in the months in which they were actually sold f foreign corruption 2019 was a record setting year for fcpa enforcement by both the sec and the doj the sec prosecuted 19 fcpa enforcement actions in 2019 securing the agency more than 1 billion in monetary recoveries that was in addition to the single year record 1 6 billion recovered by doj in more than 30 fcpa cases these recoveries were driven in large part by the single largest corporate fcpa resolution in history in early december 2019 the sec and the doj announced that the swedish networking and telecommunications company telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson ericsson agreed to pay over 1 billion to resolve fcpa charges 198 the government alleged that ericsson violated the anti bribery books and records and internal controls provisions of the fcpa by using sham consultants and slush funds to secretly funnel money to government officials in china vietnam indonesia djibouti saudi arabia and kuwait through its alleged bribery ericsson was able to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in profits approximately 427 million of which were derived from business in china djibouti and saudi arabia alone to settle the sec s charges ericsson agreed to pay more than 539 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest the doj charges were resolved through a three year deferred prosecution agreement and criminal penalty of more than 520 million in addition ericsson was required to retain an independent compliance monitor for three years aside from record corporate resolutions 2019 saw noteworthy developments in the area of fcpa liability for individuals in november 2019 a federal jury returned a guilty verdict against lawrence hoskins 199 hoskins is british national and resident who was charged with using consultants to pay bribes in indonesia to secure a 118 million power plant contract for the u s subsidiary of alstom s a though he was an alstom s a executive hoskins did not work for the u s subsidiary and never travelled to the united states during the alleged scheme the government argued that he was subject to criminal jurisdiction under the fcpa because he acted as an agent of the u s subsidiary the parties vigorously debated the meaning of agency and the district court largely adopted the government s view that agency required 1 a manifestation by the principal that the agent will act for the principal 2 an acceptance by the agent of an undertaking for the principal and 3 an understanding that the principal is in control of those acts or services using that definition of agency the jury convicted hoskins apparently based on witness testimony that hoskins was looped into the negotiations with the consultants and was acting at the direction of the u s subsidiary though it will potentially bolster future prosecution efforts against individuals the government s victory in hoskins is not secured as the agency issue will receive further scrutiny in hoskins post trial motion for judgment of acquittal and in any subsequent appeal the government s success in hoskins stands in contrast to the result in the trial of jean boustani on december 2 2019 a federal jury in brooklyn acquitted boustani of charges of wire fraud securities fraud and money laundering boustani had been charged along with several other individuals in a bribery scheme involving loans to the government of mozambique to develop the country s maritime infrastructure and fishing industry in what has been called the tuna bonds scheme boustani and others allegedly organized more than 2 billion in loans financed by major international banks to mozambique government controlled companies while diverting more than 200 million of the proceeds to themselves in the form of kickbacks and to mozambican officials in the form of bribes prosecutors pinned their theory of the case and jurisdiction for the charges on the fact that bribery payments passed through u s banks some located in the eastern district of new york the defense countered that boustani had no reason to know that payments would pass through u s banks and in any event the u s government was not the world s policeman these defense efforts were successful as the jury acquitted boustani jurors who later spoke publicly said that their decision came down to a lack of proper venue in the eastern district of new york g digital realty impact on whistleblowers following the financial crisis congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank which included new financial incentives for whistleblowers who provide the sec with original information about violations of federal securities laws as well as enhanced protections from retaliation for reporting potential violations in fy 2019 the sec received over 5 200 whistleblower tips a nearly 76 increase since fy 2012 but a slight decrease from fy 2018 the sec also awarded over 60 million to 8 individuals an amount that was a significant decrease from the 168 million distributed in fy 2018 since the beginning of the whistleblower program the commission has awarded approximately 387 million to 67 individuals since issuing its first award in 2012 a key focus of fy 2019 was how the supreme court s ruling in digital realty trust inc v somers200 would impact whistleblowers reporting decisions in digital realty the court relied on what it found to be clear statutory language to hold that a whistleblower is any individual who provides information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the commission 201 therefore individuals who only reported internally would no longer be afforded anti retaliation protections under dodd frank many commentators were worried that the ruling would discourage internal reporting and deny companies the opportunity to investigate claims first assess their legitimacy and take pro active remedial action where necessary possibly even voluntarily self disclosing to the sec surprisingly seven of the eight whistleblowers who received awards in fy 2019 reported their concerns internally at their respective companies however enforcement actions can sometimes take years to complete and therefore the effect of digital realty on internal reporting may not be fully reflected in fy 2019 numbers h sec remedies the sec s disgorgement remedy has been a hotly contested issue in recent years in kokesh v sec 202 the supreme court concluded that the sec s ability to seek disgorgement as a remedy in an enforcement action is subject to a five year statute of limitations 203 a unanimous supreme court held that disgorgement is not available outside the five year limitations period because disgorgement bears all the hallmarks of a penalty 204 the court noted in passing that its holding may implicate whether courts have properly applied disgorgement principles in this context and specifically whether courts possess authority to order disgorgement in sec enforcement proceedings 205 in november 2019 the supreme court granted certiorari in liu v sec which will determine the sec s authority to obtain disgorgement in federal court actions in 2016 the sec charged a husband and wife for defrauding chinese investors by falsely claiming that their investments would support a project that met the requirements of the eb 5 immigrant investment program the proposed project included funding the development and operation of a cancer treatment center the sec alleged that the defendants misappropriated or diverted the funds the u s district court for the central district of california granted summary judgment to the sec and ordered the couple to disgorge approximately 26 7 million as well as pay a civil money penalty of over 8 million the issue before the supreme court is whether the securities and exchange commission may seek and obtain disgorgement from a court as equitable relief for a securities law violation even though the supreme court has determined that such disgorgement is a penalty in their petition for certiorari the petitioners argued that disgorgement is not equitable relief under the court s reasoning in kokesh and therefore the sec does not have the power to obtain disgorgement in judicial proceedings because it has not been authorized by congress to do so the sec also continued to look for ways to use remedies other than large financial penalties to further its enforcement goals in 2019 following in the footsteps of its fy 18 cases against theranos where it required the ceo to relinquish control and has prevented her from profiting from a sale of the company until the money is returned to investors and tesla where it required the ceo to resign as chairman and the company to add two new independent directors the sec brought a number of enforcement actions in 2019 where it required parties to comply with detailed undertakings to further the sec s remedial objectives and address the wrongdoing at issue one example was the sec s settled action against kpmg which required kpmg to conduct an investigation to identify individuals who violated ethical and integrity requirements related to training programs conduct ethics and integrity training for all audit professionals and retain an independent consultant 206 another example was the sec s settlement with the options clearing corporation occ which required occ to retain an independent consultant provide an annual compliant report to its board provide the board with copies of all deficiency letters and establish a board level committee to monitor compliance 207 vi looking ahead we expect 2020 like 2019 to be an eventful year in securities litigation and enforcement in particular we will be watching for noteworthy developments in the following areas will plaintiffs success continue in 2019 numerous significant decisions came down in favor of plaintiffs from endorsing expanded theories of liability to rejecting challenges at the class certification stage one of the ongoing struggles in securities law is the balance between permitting meritorious claims on the one hand and dialing back on frivolous suits and abuses on the other we will watch for counter trends in the year to come the evolving scope of scheme liability in the wake of the supreme court s decision in lorenzo discussed above made clear that the question in a securities fraud suit is not whether someone made a misstatement but whether the defendant participated in a fraudulent scheme we already have seen courts in multiple jurisdictions sustain fraud claims on this basis we expect defendants to test the outer limits of scheme liability and courts to offer further guidance in the year ahead scope of morrison in predominantly foreign transactions as discussed above in 2019 the supreme court refused to hear an appeal from the ninth circuit s decision in stoyas concerning the extraterritorial reach of section 10 b liability the ninth circuit held that a foreign issuer can be subject to section 10 b liability in connection with a purely domestic transaction in its securities in which the foreign issuer had no direct involvement that parted ways with the second circuit which has held a domestic transaction is not sufficient in and of itself for section 10 b liability if the transaction is otherwise predominantly foreign

it s hardly surprising that if a democrat wins the white house taxes on wealthy americans and corporations will probably go up how they ll go up is the more interesting question the 2020 democratic presidential candidates generally agree the u s economy faces a variety of challenges record high income inequality decaying infrastructure failing public schools climate change that is already leading to fires and floods and a lack of health insurance for millions of americans to name a few to remedy these problems every candidate has proposed raising government revenue by increasing taxes on the rich in one way or another whether through higher income tax rates a wealth tax or changing how investment income is treated here is a brief look at the tax plans of the top eight candidates in the polls all of whom will be in the feb 7 democratic debate except billionaire michael bloomberg and what economists like me think about them individual income taxes president donald trump s 2017 tax reform law reduced the top individual income tax rate from 39 6 to 37 every democratic candidate running to replace trump agrees that it should be raised most suggest returning it to 39 6 a few think it should go higher bloomberg proposes an additional 5 surcharge on income above us 5 million yielding a 44 6 rate while vermont sen bernie sanders wants a top rate of 52 for taxes on lower and middle income americans the candidates generally say they plan to leave the current rates in place or lower them the candidates focus on taxing the wealthy because they say the richest americans have benefited greatly from u s tax policy in the recent past and are no longer paying their fair share the question that economists ask when assessing such policies is when do high tax rates have negative economic consequences such as by discouraging productive work because uncle sam takes such a big chunk of each extra dollar they earn the standard economic argument for lower marginal tax rates is that it provides incentives for people to work hard and be productive but it s not clear at what rate that happens and 37 does not seem to be the tipping point for perspective every year from 1940 to 1980 the top marginal tax rate was at least 70 yet productivity growth and economic growth were both robust over this period investment income a related issue is should investment income such as dividends capital gains and carried interest be taxed at a lower rate than labor income currently investment income is taxed at a top rate of 20 as opposed to the 37 tax on labor income with other rate differentials at lower incomes the democratic candidates all want to end the practice of taxing investment income at a lower rate than labor income i believe there are good reasons to do so as do many other economists primarily a lower tax rate incentivizes the wealthy to find ways to convert earnings from labor into capital income to reduce their tax bill and believe it or not private equity managers who typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year have all their earnings classified as capital income cutting their tax bill in half corporate income tax the 2017 trump tax bill also cut corporate taxes from 35 to 21 with proponents arguing it would spur business investment and economic growth several studies however found little or no evidence of this impact and the 2017 tax bill reduced corporate tax revenues as a share of gdp to 1 1 from the 50 year average of 1 9 putting a larger proportion of the tax burden on individuals this is why all the democratic candidates propose raising corporate tax rates some such as former vice president joe biden and minnesota sen amy klobuchar want to raise the rate some while others such as mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren would restore the pre trump 35 rate similar to the individual tax finding the optimal corporate tax rate can be tricky generally speaking changes to corporate taxes have little impact on the u s economy so raising them shouldn t slow growth higher corporate taxes do however reduce stock prices since corporations will pay more money to the government and less to shareholders as dividends thereby reducing incentives to own stock shares this can hurt less wealthy americans with investments in retirement plans and mutual funds a wealth tax sens sanders and warren argue the super wealthy should pay even higher taxes to reduce inequality and to cover their bigger spending plans most americans agree warren wants to slap a 2 tax on net worth in excess of 50 million and a 3 tax on fortunes in excess of 1 billion sanders would go further he suggests a tax of 1 on net worth over 32 million that would get progressively higher rising to 8 on wealth over 10 billion economists are not huge wealth tax fans they think it would spark tax evasion and for this reason not likely lead to much additional revenue more than that a wealth tax may be unconstitutional even if congress were to pass such a tax it would immediately be challenged in the courts the supreme court would likely hold it unconstitutional as was the case with the individual income tax which required the 16th amendment to the u s constitution be passed before it could be implemented carbon tax carbon taxes are taxes on polluting activities such as the use of gasoline or electricity economists across the political spectrum tend to support taxing carbon because it creates incentives for consumers and businesses to spend money in ways that reduce carbon emissions and slow climate change it would however increase the cost of driving flying and heating one s home it would also increase the price of all goods transported long distances and whose production requires a good deal of energy this regressive side to the tax is why sanders doesn t support carbon taxes though most of the other candidates do as an example yang s 40 per ton tax would cost the average american family 2 000 a year besides helping the environment the entrepreneur says a carbon tax would help finance his basic income guarantee turning the page with few exceptions the democrats running for president seem to be on the same basic tax policy page they all want to raise more revenue by taxing capital income at the same rate as labor income and increasing rates on the wealthy and on corporations they differ over the extra taxes like on carbon wealth and financial transactions whatever combination of these tax changes might be enacted if a democrat wins the white house in 2020 and congress is controlled by the democrats the rich will almost certainly lose their large gains under trump steven pressman professor of economics colorado state university this article is republished from the conversation under a creative

washington president trump released a 4 8 trillion budget proposal on monday that includes a familiar list of deep cuts to student loan assistance affordable housing efforts food stamps and medicaid reflecting mr trump s election year effort to continue shrinking the federal safety net the proposal which is unlikely to be approved in its entirety by congress includes additional spending for the military national defense and border enforcement along with money for veterans mr trump s space force initiative and an extension of the individual income tax cuts that were set to expire in 2025 its biggest reduction is an annual 2 percent decrease in spending on discretionary domestic programs like education and environmental protection speaking to the nation s governors at the white house on monday mr trump said that his budget proposal would bolster the united states military and nuclear arsenal and bring the deficit close to zero in not that long a period of time however mr trump s budget does not estimate wiping out the deficit until 2035 and gets there only through rosy assumptions about economic growth an area where the administration s past predictions have proved to be overconfident and the continued ability of the government to borrow money at rock bottom rates it also projects adding 3 4 trillion to the national debt by 2024 at the end of a potential second trump term

by last week antonio weiss along with co author laura kawano released a paper advocating a financial transactions tax ftt i have long been an advocate of ftts so i m always glad to see another paper making the case however what made this paper especially noteworthy is weiss s background weiss had been a top treasury official under president obama and previously a partner at the investment bank lazard so he is not the sort of person who would typically be expected to support a ftt even more striking is the fact that the paper was published by the hamilton project at the brookings institution the founder and main funder of the hamilton project is robert rubin rubin has a long career in the financial sector including top positions at both goldman sachs and citigroup between his jobs at these two wall street behemoths rubin held top positions in the clinton administration serving as both head of the national economic council and treasury secretary there is probably no one who has been more visibly associated with the idea of giving the financial sector free rein than mr rubin for this reason it is really remarkable that a paper advocating a ftt would come out of the hamilton project in the last quarter century we have seen the idea of a ftt go from a concept being pushed by the radical fringe bernie sanders was one of the few sponsors of a house bill in the early 1990s to an idea very much in the center of the democratic party in fact all three of the leading contenders for the democratic presidential nomination have come out in favor of a ftt we re still far from seeing a ftt get enacted the financial industry would probably kill to protect their profits but it is now an idea that is treated seriously in mainstream political debates federal reserve board policy ftts are not the only area of economic debate where we have seen a large leftward shift over the last quarter century as i have touted on prior occasions the federal reserve board has hugely shifted its attitude on the problem of unemployment federal reserve board chair jerome powell now explicitly talks about the need to push the unemployment rate as low as possible in order to help the most disadvantaged groups in the labor market this follows several decades in which the fed s leadership was prepared to largely ignore its mandate to promote full employment many wanted to make containing inflation the fed s only goal this change in perspective which the labor and community backed fed up coalition did much to advance has made a huge difference in the lives of millions of people there were many economists including many in leadership positions at the fed who argued that inflation would begin to spiral upward if the unemployment rate was allowed to fall to 5 0 percent or lower they advocated raising interest rates to slow the economy and reduce the rate of job creation fortunately then chair janet yellen and jerome powell her successor chose to delay and then limit interest rate hikes allowing the unemployment rate to continue to fall with the unemployment rate now at 3 5 percent and absolutely no evidence of increasing inflation it s clear that they made the right choice not only has this drop in the unemployment rate allowed millions more to get jobs it has hugely improved the labor market for african americans hispanics less educated workers and people with criminal records in 2015 when the overall unemployment was falling to levels that worried inflation hawks the unemployment rate for african americans was near 10 0 percent today it is under 6 0 percent in 2015 the unemployment rate for african american teens was near 30 0 percent it is now hovering near 20 0 percent there would be similar stories for other disadvantaged groups while we can t be satisfied with an african american unemployment rate that is near 6 0 percent or a teen unemployment rate over 20 percent this is still an enormously better situation than what we were seeing five years ago this change in policy at the fed made a huge difference also it is important to note that tighter labor markets have made a huge difference in the bargaining power for tens of millions of workers prior to 2015 wages for most workers had just been keeping pace with inflation as the labor market tightened and employers had to compete to find workers wages for workers at the middle and the bottom of the wage distribution began to outpace inflation by a bit more than 1 0 percent annually those at the bottom did even better due to hikes in the minimum wage in many states and cities this wage growth is not great but most workers have done much better over the last five years than would have been the case if the unemployment rate were still above 5 0 percent social security back in the 1990s the centrist democratic positon was that social security needed to be cut the democrats did not want to cut as much as the republicans and most opposed the privatization of the program but arguing that benefit levels should be sustained without cuts was seen as a far out position as recently as 2012 president obama was seeking a grand bargain with republicans that would have included a change in the cost of living adjustment that would have reduced benefits for long lived retirees by more than 9 0 percent here too there has been an enormous shift in the debate the centrist position in the democratic party is now to increase benefits the debate is over the size of the increase for example senator warren is proposing to raise benefits by 200 a month a positon that would have been seen as outlandish back in the 1990s the minimum wage back in the 1980s the minimum wage was so out of style that the new york times once ran an editorial saying that the optimal minimum wage was zero new research in the early 1990s showed that modest increases in the minimum wage did not lead to measurable job loss since then there has been much additional research showing that considerably larger increases in the minimum wage also do not lead to job loss in addition contrary to what many had previously thought including me it was possible to not only have substantial minimum wage hikes at the state level but even at the local level as a result of this research many states and cities are now in the process of moving to a 15 an hour minimum wage even as the national minimum wage remains frozen at 7 25 an hour in the case of seattle the minimum wage at large employers is already 16 39 an hour this higher wage makes an enormous difference in people s lives a full time full year worker getting 16 39 an hour will make almost 33 000 a year that compares to just 20 000 a year if they were working for 10 an hour paid leave and severance pay another aspect of the 1990s conventional wisdom was that we wanted to place as few restrictions as possible on employers this precluded items like mandated family leave and sick pay which had long been accepted practice in other wealthy countries here too there has been enormous progress at the state and local level even as the federal government has lagged behind many states including california and new york now require most employers to provide paid family leave and sick days cities have also moved ahead with many progressive cities requiring paid leave in states without such mandates or have more generous mandates than the ones set at the state level new york city is actually close to moving ahead with a statute that would require two weeks a year of paid vacation for most workers this would be a first for the mainland of the united states although puerto rico has mandated paid vacation for some time and just last month new jersey became the first state in the country to require severance pay when companies have mass layoffs of more than fifty workers in all of these areas we still have a long way to go to catch up with most european countries however the point is that we are moving in the right direction it is certainly reasonable to think that with a democrat in the white house we would see some of these measures adopted at the national level but even if there is no action at the national level it is virtually certain that more state and local governments will adopt leave policies and severance pay requirements when they see it did not result in economic disasters in their neighbors bigger changes in the future i write pieces like this every few months or so in part to point out the progress that has been made but also to convince myself that it is possible to move an economic consensus that often seems oblivious to facts and logic it can be very depressing at times the view that the economy has an autonomous logic independent of policy choices is very deep see this column by e j dionne who is very decent person and certainly on the liberal side of the political spectrum the right for obvious reasons would like us to think that the enormous inequality generated by the market is just a natural outcome the story goes that we can do some tinkering with tax and transfer policy but we have to be very careful or we will upset the apple cart and destroy the economy s ability to operate unfortunately much of the left seems to largely accept this view with the difference being that they think we can do larger tinkering without upsetting the apple cart the idea that we can change the workings of the machine itself so that the market is not generating large amounts of inequality seems to be off the table with the left as well this is one of the reasons i focus so much on patent and copyright monopolies it should be pretty obvious that these are not natural outcomes of the market but tools of the government to accomplish specific public purposes there is also an enormous amount of money at stake and in the case of drugs and medical equipment people s lives it should be possible to get the mainstream of economists to acknowledge the obvious truth that government granted patent and copyright monopolies are not the free market i m sure that one day an economist will be celebrated for discovering this fact in an important new book it should also be possible to get economists to accept that having far more doctors in the u s would mean lower pay for doctors you know supply and demand and that paying corrupt and or incompetent ceos tens of millions of dollars is not in the interest of shareholders yeah this is my sales pitch for rigged anyhow it is possible to change policy debates it just isn t easy and it takes a long time this article first appeared on dean baker s beat the press blog
