gold and gold stocks step into 2019 with positive momentum that has been absent for much of the preceding 12 months for vaneck conditions may now be right to move the gold price past the us 1 365 barrier that it has been struggling to attain for the past five years by joe foster portfolio manager and strategist after a difficult 2018 we believe that gold prices will resume an upwards trajectory this year with investors likely to commit strong inflows into bullion exchange traded products having stabilised at around us 1 200 per ounce during the third quarter the gold price rose alongside other commodities in early december when us president donald trump and china s president xi jinping communicated a pause in their trade conflict it then rose to a six month high later in the month following the federal reserve s decision to raise us interest rates on december 19 since the us stock market hit a peak on september 21 gold has outperformed west texas intermediate wti crude oil by 42 and the nyse arca gold miners index gdmntr 1 has outperformed the s p 500 index2 by 27 markets are now beginning to price in an end to the post crisis expansion and in line with this assessment price levels for gold the us dollar and us treasuries all signal a rise in global financial risk during 2019 a challenging 2018 it was a tough year for gold and gold stocks with only december providing respite reflected in a 4 9 rise in the gold price to us 1 282 45 per ounce and a 10 8 gain in the gdmntr over the month the strength of the us dollar which performed better than expected against other currencies created a headwind for gold the us economy received a boost from the trump tax cuts and deficit spending which contributed to strong growth low unemployment and an annual gain of 4 for the us dollar index dxy 3 when profiled against a booming us economy and stock market highs gold investments did little to attract investors for a large part of the year in august weak fundamentals caused the gold price to slide to a yearly low of us 1 160 although investment flows recovered slightly towards the year end and the commodity finished 2018 with an annual loss of us 20 down 1 6 year on year gold stocks found it even harder to attract investment flows and the leading indices lost ground with the gdmntr falling 8 5 during 2018 and the mvis global junior gold miners index mvgdxjtr 4 down 11 3 it was a particularly challenging environment for junior companies which we define to be companies producing less than 300 000 ounces per year and most juniors failed to outperform the gdmntr benchmark on a positive note this weak stock performance often disguises strong fundamentals and a number of these companies are delivering solid performance both operationally and financially this has resulted in valuations for these stocks that are well below the long term average we believe that these will be attractive to investors until this value gap closes contrary to last year 2019 is beginning with a global contraction theme what a difference a year makes just as early 2018 may be remembered for a period of synchronised global growth the start of 2019 is delivering a phase of synchronised global contraction the purchasing managers index pmi 5 in china a benchmark of manufacturing performance slipped into contraction in december as measured both by the official chinese national bureau of statistics and caixin markit a private survey japan and germany both logged negative gdp growth in the third quarter in the us 49 of chief financial officers believe the economy will begin a recession in 2019 according to a duke university survey6 and 82 are expecting a recession within the next two years for central bank policies it is widely assumed that there is roughly a 12 month lag between their public announcement and these policies beginning to take effect based on this assumption the us economy is likely to feel the full impact during 2019 of the fed s 2018 rate hikes and us 30 billion of monthly quantitative tightening qt this trend is likely to be compounded by further fed rate rises that are expected during the year and by the fed decision to increase qt to us 50 billion per month we anticipate one of two scenarios if the fed stays on course during 2019 this may drive the economy into recession and may bring increased financial risks from highly indebted governments and corporates alternatively the fed may pause or reverse its tightening cycle resulting in us dollar weakness both scenarios are likely to be favourable for gold gold and gold stocks enter the new year with positive momentum that was lacking for most of 2018 in our opinion gold may again test the us 1 365 level of resistance that has been in place now for five years if the markets are seeing enough systemic risks to move gold through this level we believe it should be a very good year for investors in gold and gold stocks a bear market not a crash is more likely and gold investments could be less volatile finally if we are correct in calling for a recession to start in the coming 12 months would markets crash as they did in 2000 and 2008 or would it be a more orderly bear market barring a black swan event and aside from cryptocurrencies there are not any obvious manias in this cycle however there has been asset price inflation in stocks bonds real estate and other asset classes in totality this has possibly created the largest asset bubble in history but without mania psychology a crash is less likely in our view an added risk in this cycle is an explosion of sovereign debt this may bring a policy response from central banks in a downturn that distorts and drives markets but we believe it is unlikely to precipitate a crash especially with a more stable post crisis banking system gold investments may see less volatility in a crash less downturn important definitions and disclosures this article is for informational

byjohn bellamy foster monthly review less than two decades into the twenty first century it is evident that capitalism has failed as a social system the world is mired in economic stagnation financialization and the most extreme inequality in human history accompanied by mass unemployment and underemployment precariousness poverty hunger wasted output and lives and what at this point can only be called a planetary ecological death spiral 1 the digital revolution the greatest technological advance of our time has rapidly mutated from a promise of free communication and liberated production into new means of surveillance control and displacement of the working population the institutions of liberal democracy are at the point of collapse while fascism the rear guard of the capitalist system is again on the march along with patriarchy racism imperialism and war to say that capitalism is a failed system is not of course to suggest that its breakdown and disintegration is imminent 2 it does however mean that it has passed from being a historically necessary and creative system at its inception to being a historically unnecessary and destructive one in the present century today more than ever the world is faced with the epochal choice between the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large and the common ruin of the contending classes 3 indications of this failure of capitalism are everywhere stagnation of investment punctuated by bubbles of financial expansion which then inevitably burst now characterizes the so called free market 4 soaring inequality in income and wealth has its counterpart in the declining material circumstances of a majority of the population real wages for most workers in the united states have barely budged in forty years despite steadily rising productivity 5 work intensity has increased while work and safety protections on the job have been systematically jettisoned unemployment data has become more and more meaningless due to a new institutionalized underemployment in the form of contract labor in the gig economy 6 unions have been reduced to mere shadows of their former glory as capitalism has asserted totalitarian control over workplaces with the demise of soviet type societies social democracy in europe has perished in the new atmosphere of liberated capitalism 7 the capture of the surplus value produced by overexploited populations in the poorest regions of the world via the global labor arbitrage instituted by multinational corporations is leading to an unprecedented amassing of financial wealth at the center of the world economy and relative poverty in the periphery 8 around 21 trillion of offshore funds are currently lodged in tax havens on islands mostly in the caribbean constituting the fortified refuge of big finance 9 technologically driven monopolies resulting from the global communications revolution together with the rise to dominance of wall street based financial capital geared to speculative asset creation have further contributed to the riches of today s 1 percent forty two billionaires now enjoy as much wealth as half the world s population while the three richest men in the united states jeff bezos bill gates and warren buffett have more wealth than half the u s population 10 in every region of the world inequality has increased sharply in recent decades 11 the gap in per capita income and wealth between the richest and poorest nations which has been the dominant trend for centuries is rapidly widening once again 12 more than 60 percent of the world s employed population some two billion people now work in the impoverished informal sector forming a massive global proletariat the global reserve army of labor is some 70 percent larger than the active labor army of formally employed workers 13 adequate health care housing education and clean water and air are increasingly out of reach for large sections of the population even in wealthy countries in north america and europe while transportation is becoming more difficult in the united states and many other countries due to irrationally high levels of dependency on the automobile and disinvestment in public transportation urban structures are more and more characterized by gentrification and segregation with cities becoming the playthings of the well to do while marginalized populations are shunted aside about half a million people most of them children are homeless on any given night in the united states 14 new york city is experiencing a major rat infestation attributed to warming temperatures mirroring trends around the world 15 in the united states and other high income countries life expectancy is in decline with a remarkable resurgence of victorian illnesses related to poverty and exploitation in britain gout scarlet fever whooping cough and even scurvy are now resurgent along with tuberculosis with inadequate enforcement of work health and safety regulations black lung disease has returned with a vengeance in u s coal country 16 overuse of antibiotics particularly by capitalist agribusiness is leading to an antibiotic resistance crisis with the dangerous growth of superbugs generating increasing numbers of deaths which by mid century could surpass annual cancer deaths prompting the world health organization to declare a global health emergency 17 these dire conditions arising from the workings of the system are consistent with what frederick engels in the condition of the working class in england called social murder 18 at the instigation of giant corporations philanthrocapitalist foundations and neoliberal governments public education has been restructured around corporate designed testing based on the implementation of robotic common core standards this is generating massive databases on the student population much of which are now being surreptitiously marketed and sold 19 the corporatization and privatization of education is feeding the progressive subordination of children s needs to the cash nexus of the commodity market we are thus seeing a dramatic return of thomas gradgrind s and mr m choakumchild s crass utilitarian philosophy dramatized in charles dickens s hard times facts are alone wanted in life and you are never to fancy 20 having been reduced to intellectual dungeons many of the poorest most racially segregated schools in the united states are mere pipelines for prisons or the military 21 more than two million people in the united states are behind bars a higher rate of incarceration than any other country in the world constituting a new jim crow the total population in prison is nearly equal to the number of people in houston texas the fourth largest u s city african americans and latinos make up 56 percent of those incarcerated while constituting only about 32 percent of the u s population nearly 50 percent of american adults and a much higher percentage among african americans and native americans have an immediate family member who has spent or is currently spending time behind bars both black men and native american men in the united states are nearly three times hispanic men nearly two times more likely to die of police shootings than white men 22 racial divides are now widening across the entire planet violence against women and the expropriation of their unpaid labor as well as the higher level of exploitation of their paid labor are integral to the way in which power is organized in capitalist society and how it seeks to divide rather than unify the population more than a third of women worldwide have experienced physical sexual violence women s bodies in particular are objectified reified and commodified as part of the normal workings of monopoly capitalist marketing 23 the mass media propaganda system part of the larger corporate matrix is now merging into a social media based propaganda system that is more porous and seemingly anarchic but more universal and more than ever favoring money and power utilizing modern marketing and surveillance techniques which now dominate all digital interactions vested interests are able to tailor their messages largely unchecked to individuals and their social networks creating concerns about fake news on all sides 24 numerous business entities promising technological manipulation of voters in countries across the world have now surfaced auctioning off their services to the highest bidders 25 the elimination of net neutrality in the united states means further concentration centralization and control over the entire internet by monopolistic service providers elections are increasingly prey to unregulated dark money emanating from the coffers of corporations and the billionaire class although presenting itself as the world s leading democracy the united states as paul baran and paul sweezy stated in monopoly capital in 1966 is democratic in form and plutocratic in content 26 in the trump administration following a long established tradition 72 percent of those appointed to the cabinet have come from the higher corporate echelons while others have been drawn from the military 27 war engineered by the united states and other major powers at the apex of the system has become perpetual in strategic oil regions such as the middle east and threatens to escalate into a global thermonuclear exchange during the obama administration the united states was engaged in wars bombings in seven different countries afghanistan iraq syria libya yemen somalia and pakistan 28 torture and assassinations have been reinstituted by washington as acceptable instruments of war against those now innumerable individuals group networks and whole societies that are branded as terrorist a new cold war and nuclear arms race is in the making between the united states and russia while washington is seeking to place road blocks to the continued rise of china the trump administration has created a new space force as a separate branch of the military in an attempt to ensure u s dominance in the militarization of space sounding the alarm on the increasing dangers of a nuclear war and of climate destabilization the distinguished bulletin of atomic scientists moved its doomsday clock in 2018 to two minutes to midnight the closest since 1953 when it marked the advent of thermonuclear weapons 29 increasingly severe economic sanctions are being imposed by the united states on countries like venezuela and nicaragua despite their democratic elections or because of them trade and currency wars are being actively promoted by core states while racist barriers against immigration continue to be erected in europe and the united states as some 60 million refugees and internally displaced peoples flee devastated environments migrant populations worldwide have risen to 250 million with those residing in high income countries constituting more than 14 percent of the populations of those countries up from less than 10 percent in 2000 meanwhile ruling circles and wealthy countries seek to wall off islands of power and privilege from the mass of humanity who are to be left to their fate 30 more than three quarters of a billion people over 10 percent of the world population are chronically malnourished 31 food stress in the united states keeps climbing leading to the rapid growth of cheap dollar stores selling poor quality and toxic food around forty million americans representing one out of eight households including nearly thirteen million children are food insecure 32 subsistence farmers are being pushed off their lands by agribusiness private capital and sovereign wealth funds in a global depeasantization process that constitutes the greatest movement of people in history 33 urban overcrowding and poverty across much of the globe is so severe that one can now reasonably refer to a planet of slums 34 meanwhile the world housing market is estimated to be worth up to 163 trillion as compared to the value of gold mined over all recorded history estimated at 7 5 trillion 35 the anthropocene epoch first ushered in by the great acceleration of the world economy immediately after the second world war has generated enormous rifts in planetary boundaries extending from climate change to ocean acidification to the sixth extinction to disruption of the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles to the loss of freshwater to the disappearance of forests to widespread toxic chemical and radioactive pollution 36 it is now estimated that 60 percent of the world s wildlife vertebrate population including mammals reptiles amphibians birds and fish have been wiped out since 1970 while the worldwide abundance of invertebrates has declined by 45 percent in recent decades 37 what climatologist james hansen calls the species exterminations resulting from accelerating climate change and rapidly shifting climate zones are only compounding this general process of biodiversity loss biologists expect that half of all species will be facing extinction by the end of the century 38 if present climate change trends continue the global carbon budget associated with a 2 c increase in average global temperature will be broken in sixteen years while a 1 5 c increase in global average temperature staying beneath which is the key to long term stabilization of the climate will be reached in a decade earth system scientists warn that the world is now perilously close to a hothouse earth in which catastrophic climate change will be locked in and irreversible 39 the ecological social and economic costs to humanity of continuing to increase carbon emissions by 2 0 percent a year as in recent decades rising in 2018 by 2 7 percent 3 4 percent in the united states and failing to meet the minimal 3 0 percent annual reductions in emissions currently needed to avoid a catastrophic destabilization of the earth s energy balance are simply incalculable 40 for many people on the left the answer to neoliberalism or disaster capitalism is a return to welfare state liberalism market regulation or some form of limited social democracy and thus to a more rational capitalism it is not the failure of capitalism itself that is perceived as the problem but rather the failure of neoliberal capitalism nevertheless major energy corporations continue to lie about climate change promoting and bankrolling climate denialism while admitting the truth in their internal documents these corporations are working to accelerate the extraction and production of fossil fuels including the dirtiest most greenhouse gas generating varieties reaping enormous profits in the process the melting of the arctic ice from global warming is seen by capital as a new el dorado opening up massive additional oil and gas reserves to be exploited without regard to the consequences for the earth s climate in response to scientific reports on climate change exxon mobil declared that it intends to extract and sell all of the fossil fuel reserves at its disposal 41 energy corporations continue to intervene in climate negotiations to ensure that any agreements to limit carbon emissions are defanged capitalist countries across the board are putting the accumulation of wealth for a few above combatting climate destabilization threatening the very future of humanity capitalism is best understood as a competitive class based mode of production and exchange geared to the accumulation of capital through the exploitation of workers labor power and the private appropriation of surplus value value generated beyond the costs of the workers own reproduction the mode of economic accounting intrinsic to capitalism designates as a value generating good or service anything that passes through the market and therefore produces income it follows that the greater part of the social and environmental costs of production outside the market are excluded in this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative externalities unrelated to the capitalist economy itself whether in terms of the shortening and degradation of human life or the destruction of the natural environment as environmental economist k william kapp stated capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs 42 we have now reached a point in the twenty first century in which the externalities of this irrational system such as the costs of war the depletion of natural resources the waste of human lives and the disruption of the planetary environment now far exceed any future economic benefits that capitalism offers to society as a whole the accumulation of capital and the amassing of wealth are increasingly occurring at the expense of an irrevocable rift in the social and environmental conditions governing human life on earth 43 some would argue that china stands as an exception to much of the above characterized as it is by a seemingly unstoppable rate of economic advance though carrying with it deep social and ecological contradictions yet chinese development has its roots in the 1949 chinese revolution carried out by the chinese communist party headed by mao zedong whereby it liberated itself from the imperialist system this allowed it to develop for decades under a planned economy largely free of constraints from outside forces establishing a strong agricultural and industrial economic base this was followed by a shift in the post maoist reform period to a hybrid system of more limited state planning along with a much greater reliance on market relations and a vast expansion of debt and speculation under conditions the globalization of the world market that were particularly fortuitous to its catching up through trade wars and other pressures aimed at destabilizing china s position in the world market the united states is already seeking to challenge the bases of china s growth in world trade china therefore stands not so much for the successes of late capitalism but rather for its inherent limitations the current chinese model moreover carries within it many of the destructive tendencies of the system of capital accumulation ultimately china s future too depends on a return to the process of revolutionary transition spurred by its own population 44 how did these disastrous conditions characterizing capitalism worldwide develop an understanding of the failure of capitalism beginning in the twentieth century requires a historical examination of the rise of neoliberalism and how this has only served to increase the destructiveness of the system only then can we address the future of humanity in the twenty first century neoliberalism and capitalist failure many of the symptoms of the failure of capitalism described above are well known nevertheless they are often attributed not to capitalism as a system but simply to neoliberalism viewed as a particular paradigm of capitalist development that can be replaced by another better one for many people on the left the answer to neoliberalism or disaster capitalism is a return to welfare state liberalism market regulation or some form of limited social democracy and thus to a more rational capitalism it is not the failure of capitalism itself that is perceived as the problem but rather the failure ofcapitalism in contrast the marxian tradition understands neoliberalism as an inherent outgrowth of late capitalism associated with the domination of monopoly finance capital a critical historical analysis of neoliberalism is therefore crucial both to grounding our understanding of capitalism today and uncovering the reason why all alternatives to neoliberalism and its capitalist absolutism are closed within the system itself the term neoliberalism had its origin in the early 1920s in the marxian critique of ludwig von mises s nation state and economy 1919 and socialism an economic and sociological analysis 1922 both of which were written as virulent anti socialist tracts constituting the foundational works of neoliberal capitalist ideology 45 in these works mises then employed by the vienna chamber of commerce insisted that the old liberalism had to be relaid in such a way as to defeat socialism in the process he equated socialism with destructionism insisted that monopoly was consistent with capitalist free competition defended unlimited inequality and argued that consumers exercised democracy through their purchases which were equivalent to ballots he strongly condemned labor legislation compulsory social insurance trade unions unemployment insurance socialization or nationalization taxation and inflation as the enemies of his refurbished liberalism 46 so extreme were mises s neoliberal views that he explicitly took the side of the crass utilitarian pedagogue m choakumchild against the defiant young heroine sissy jupe as portrayed by dickens in hard times dickens mises claimed had taught millions to hate liberalism and capitalism 47 in 1921 austro marxist max adler coined the term neoliberalism to designate mises s attempt to refurbish a fading liberal order through a new ideology of market fetishism this was followed by a sharp criticism of mises s neoliberal ideology in 1923 by the gifted austro marxist helene bauer in 1924 the german marxist alfred meusel wrote a lengthy critique of mises entitled neoliberalism der neu liberalismus for the leading german socialist theoretical journal die gesellschaft edited by rudolf hilferding 48 building on a wealth of marxian analysis adler bauer and meusel attacked mises s claim that an unregulated capitalism was the only rational economic system and that socialism was equivalent to destructionism they strongly challenged his ahistorical depiction of a harmonious capitalism that promoted free exchange and free trade through the market mechanism a serious logical flaw in mises s analysis they contended was the systematic bifurcation built into his neoliberal ideology whereby trade unions were considered constraints on trade while employers associations and monopolistic corporations were justified as consistent with free competition likewise it was noted that mises advocated a strong state to repress working class struggles in the name of a self regulating market system even when state action on behalf of workers was condemned as anti free market and a form of class terror for meusel mises was a faithful servant of the mobile capitalist or international finance capital later in 1926 the protofascist economist othmar spann criticized the atavistic attempt to revert to a more extreme version of classical liberalism referring to this in his types of economic theory as the neo liberal trend 49 in 1927 in his work liberalism mises himself distinguished between the older liberalism and neoliberalism on the basis of the commitment of the former to equality in contrast to the rejection of equality other than so called equality of opportunity by the latter 50 neoliberalism as it first emerged from mises s pen was thus viewed by marxian critics in the 1920s and even by some figures on the right as an attempt to rationalize a monopoly or finance capital far removed from the precepts of classical liberalism it was designed to provide the intellectual basis for capitalist class warfare against not only socialism but all attempts at social regulation and social democracy a no quarter given attack on the working class mises s assault on socialism together with that of his protégé friedrich hayek was motivated in part by a profound disenchantment with red vienna under the sway of austro marxism which was inspired by figures like adler otto bauer and karl renner 51 conversely it was this same political environment of red vienna which dominated austrian politics from 1919 32 that inspired karl polanyi who was strongly influenced by adler and otto bauer to develop a crushing critique of the neoliberal belief in the self regulating market later to form the basis of the great transformation 1946 52 in the 1930s to 1960s following the great depression and the second world war neoliberal ideology waned in the context of the deepening crisis of capitalism in the early 1930s as the storm clouds gathered over europe mises served as an economic advisor to austrofascist chancellor dictator engelbert dollfuss prior to the nazi takeover of austria 53 he later emigrated to switzerland and then to the united states enjoying the support of the rockefeller foundation and teaching at new york university meanwhile hayek was recruited by the london school of economics at the instigation of the early neoliberal british economist lionel robbins the post second world war years in the west were known as the age of keynes spurred on by increased state spending particularly on the military in the context of the cold war the rebuilding of the war torn european and japanese economies the expansion of the sales effort waves of automobilization in both the united states and europe and two major regional wars in asia capitalist economies grew rapidly for a quarter century 54 meanwhile faced with the threat of the alternative model represented by the soviet union and the advent of strong unions as a result of the developments of the 1930s and 40s the west moved in the direction of keynesianism social democracy and the welfare state nevertheless the tendency toward economic stagnation already exhibited in the 1930s remained as a structural flaw of the system temporarily masked by the so called golden age of rapid growth and increasing income for workers that immediately followed the second world war the giant corporations of monopoly capitalism succeeded in appropriating ever greater surplus in both absolute and relative terms which was concentrated in the hands of ever fewer wealth holders leading to a tendency toward overaccumulation of capital and manufacturing overcapacity countered in part by a massive expansion of the sales effort militarism and imperialism but with ever lessening effect in stimulating the economy u s imperialism and the proliferation of dollars abroad led to a breakdown in the bretton woods system that had stabilized world trade in the early post second world war period causing richard nixon to end the dollar gold standard in 1971 this was associated with a slowdown in the u s economy from the late 1960s on as the vietnam war was winding down resulting in a structural crisis of the capitalist system in the mid 1970s which was to mark the beginning of decades of economic stagnation and a long decline in the trend rate of growth in the advanced capitalist economies the major stimuli that sparked the post second world war boom had all waned leaving the advanced capitalist economies in the doldrums 55 the first response to the structural crisis of the capitalist system that emerged in the 1970s was to utilize keynesian demand promotion to expand state spending u s civilian government spending on goods and services as a percentage of gross domestic product thus reached a peak during the nixon administration 56 this plus the struggles of unions to maintain their real wages in the crisis while monopolistic corporations aggressively raised prices to increase their profit margins led to a period of stagflation economic stagnation plus inflation inflation which depreciates accumulated wealth held in the form of monetary assets is a much greater immediate threat to the position of the capitalist class than is economic stagnation while for the working class the situation is reversed the result was the emergence of an anti keynesian movement within the capitalist class which designated anything to the left of hardcore neoliberalism as socialist or totalitarian in the manner of hayek s road to serfdom and sought to reverse decades of modest working class gains 57 there was a sharp turn toward austerity and economic restructuring initially under the guise of monetarism and supply side economics and later taking a more amorphous free market character a concerted effort to destroy unions by combined political economic and juridical means was carried out eliminating what john kenneth galbraith in his american capitalism had once called the countervailing power of labor 58 key to the reemergence of neoliberalism in the post second world period was the mont pèlerin society named after the swiss spa where mises hayek robbins milton friedman george stigler raymond aron and others met in 1947 to promote neoliberal economic and political ideas the members of the mont pèlerin society generally referred to themselves as classical liberals in the european sense no doubt remembering the devastating marxist critiques of neoliberal ideology in the 1920s they eschewed the label neoliberal which mises himself had adopted in 1927 and which had been put forward in the 1938 walter lippmann colloquium in paris that mises and hayek attended 59 instead neoliberalism was presented by its chief adherents in the mont pèlerin society not as a separate political ideology from but as an extension of classical liberalism and attributable to inherent features of human nature in this way as michel foucault argued it was converted into a kind of biopolitics 60 nevertheless while abandoning the neoliberal label the mont pèlerin society together with the department of economics at the university of chicago was to be a bastion of neoliberal ideology in precisely the sense that it had first emerged between the world wars in the keynesian era of the 1950s and 60s figures like mises hayek friedman and james buchanan remained on the margins though heavily bankrolled by private foundations 61 but with the return of economic stagnation in the 1970s neoliberal intellectuals were actively recruited at the apex of monopoly capital in order to provide the ideological basis for an ongoing corporate campaign to restructure the capitalist economy deliberately targeting labor the state and the underdeveloped economies of the global south central to neoliberal philosophy from the beginning was the defense of concentrated corporate capital and class dynasties which were portrayed as representing free market competition and entrepreneurship 62 the very virulence of neoliberal anti socialism meant that it represented the drive to a complete market privatization of social life in margaret thatcher s london and ronald reagan s washington figures like hayek and friedman became the symbols of the neoliberal era sometimes called the age of hayek the new so called nobel prize in economics or the sveriges riksbank bank of sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel established by the bank of sweden in 1969 was controlled from its inception by ultraconservative neoliberal economists seven members of the mont pèlerin society including hayek friedman stigler and buchanan received the prize between 1974 and 1992 while even mildly social democratic economists were all but excluded 63 neoliberalism as an economic ideology was largely ineffectual in normal economic policy terms judged by its lack of success in promoting growth since like neoclassical economics itself it sought to deny or rationalize the reality of an economy dominated by big business and concentrated power 64 nevertheless it served as an effective political economic strategy for big business and the emerging billionaire class in an age where monopoly finance capital sought to seize control of all monetary flows in society 65 although capitalist economies continued to stagnate with growth rates diminishing decade by decade the surplus capital in the hands of the corporate rich not only increased but by virtue of financialization globalization and the revolution in digital technology new forms of amassing wealth were created 66 financialization the relative shift of the economy from production to finance opened up vast new avenues to speculation and wealth formation relatively removed from capital investment in new productive capacity that is real capital accumulation globalization meant not only new markets but more importantly through the global labor arbitrage the appropriation of huge economic surpluses from the overexploitation of low wage labor in the periphery that ended up in the financial coffers of multinational corporations and wealthy individuals in the rich countries 67 the benefits of imperialism to workers in the center of the capitalist economy no longer included incremental gains in employment and income associated with the global dominance of production but at best could be said to contribute to cheaper prices from the outsourcing of production by multinational corporations symbolized by the growth of walmart meanwhile digital technology created the basis of a new globalized surveillance capitalism buying and selling information on the population primarily motivated by the sales effort leading to the creation of enormous information technology monopolies 68 vast increases in inequality and wealth were justified as returns for innovation always attributed to a very few rather than as the collective product of society in the new era of expropriation all was up for grabs education health systems transportation housing land cities prisons insurance pensions food entertainment all exchanges in society were to be fully commodified corporatized and financialized with the funds flowing into financial centers and feeding speculation on capital gains leveraged by debt human communication was itself to be turned into a commodity all in the name of a free market society for the powers that be this strategy was enormously successful capitalism despite adam smith had never been about the wealth of nations so much as the wealth of the capitalist class the financialization process managed to counter economic stagnation tendencies to some extent but at the cost of periodic financial crises layered over the normal business cycle nevertheless the amassing of wealth at the top continued to accelerate with financial crises themselves leading to even greater financial concentration and centralization in this situation neoliberalism increasingly took on the logic of financialized expropriation and accumulation the state too became subject to the financialization policy shifting its overall role to protecting the value of money 69 in the great financial crisis of 2007 09 the big banks and corporations were almost all bailed out the population was not rather than representing a severe crisis for neoliberalism itself the great financial crisis only gave it further impetus reflecting the fact that neoliberal politics had become the ideological expression of an all encompassing system of financial expropriation 70 a characteristic of this new era of financialized accumulation is that it is progressively removed from the realities of production and use value heightening the conflict between exchange value the value form and use value the natural form within the overall production and accumulation process 71 the result is a social and ecological planetary emergency 72 this is most evident in the rapid destruction of the natural environment fossil fuels are entered as financial assets on the books of corporations even when they exist only in the form of reserves buried in the ground in this way they are integral to the entire financialized accumulation process of monopoly capitalism trillions of dollars of wall street assets are thus tied up in fossil capital 73 this has made it doubly difficult to shift away from the extraction and use of fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives such as solar and wind power no one owns the sun s rays or the wind hence there is less of a vested interest in these forms of energy in today s capitalism more than ever before current and potential future profits dictate all at the expense of people and the planet the human population stands by seemingly helpless watching the destruction of the climate and the loss of innumerable species all imposed by the ostensibly overwhelming force of market society neoliberalism has always been directly opposed to strict laissez faire since it has invariably emphasized a strong interventionist and constructionist relation to the state in the direct service of private capital and market authoritarianism or what james k galbraith has critically referred to as the predator state 74 in the neoliberal view capitalist absolutism is not a spontaneous product it must be created the role of the state is not simply to protect property as maintained by smith but as foucault brilliantly explained in his birth of biopolitics extends to the active construction of the domination of the market over all aspects of life 75 this means refashioning the state and society on the model of the corporation or the market as foucault put it the problem of neo liberalism is how the overall exercise of political power can be modeled on the principles of a market economy the state must not correct the destructive effects of the market where these fall on society outside the market but rather take advantage of these destructive effects to impose further measures that extend the reach and penetration of the market 76 the goal is not to transcend the state altogether but to shackle it to the monopolistic competitive ends of capital a view forcefully propagated by buchanan 77 the shackles imposed on the neoliberal state dominated by monopoly finance capital are specially designed to limit any changes that would negatively affect the value of money hence both fiscal and monetary policy are increasingly put out of reach of the government itself in those cases where changes going against the vested interests are contemplated central banks have been transformed into largely autonomous branches of the state in fact controlled by the banks treasury departments are shackled by debt ceilings regulatory agencies are captured by monopoly finance capital and act for the most part in the direct interest of corporations outside governmental control 78 the result of such an attempt to construct a so called self regulating market society in fact requiring constant state interventions on behalf of capital and the creation of a predator state is as polanyi powerfully demonstrated to undermine the very foundations of society and life itself 79 but in terms of capitalism today there is no going back stagnation financialization privatization globalization the marketization of the state and the reduction of people to human capital and nature to natural capital have made neoliberal politics an irrevocable characteristic of monopoly finance capital which only an anti capitalist politics can supplant neoliberalism has thus become integrated into the system in the context of the structural crisis of capitalism in its globalized monopoly finance phase it extends this structural crisis to all of society and makes it universal and insurmountable within the system the answer to every failing of capitalism is thus to turn the screw further which accounts for much of the allure of the market principle since it is perpetually seen as the solution to the problems it causes with each failure opening up new areas of profitability for a few the result of this irrational logic is not merely economic and ecological disaster but the gradual demise of the liberal democratic state itself neoliberalism thus points inevitably to market authoritarianism and even neofascism in this respect donald trump is no mere aberration 80 as mises openly declared in 1927 in liberalism it cannot be denied that fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has for the moment saved european civilization the merit that fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history 81 hayek along with other neoliberals such as friedman and buchanan actively supported general augusto pinochet s coup in chile in 1973 overthrowing the democratically elected socialist government of salvador allende and imposing an economic shock doctrine on the population in this context hayek in a trip he took to chile in 1978 personally warned pinochet against a resurrection of unlimited democracy during a second visit in 1981 he stated that a dictatorship may be more liberal in its policies than a democratic assembly 82 as he wrote in 1949 in individualism and economic order we must face the fact that the preservation of individual freedom is incompatible with a full satisfaction of our views of distributive justice 83 neoliberalism in short is not a mere paradigm that can be dispensed with but represents the absolutist tendencies of the system in the age of monopoly finance as foucault pointed out the survival of capitalism could only be ensured for a time by the singular application of its economic logic to all of sociological existence 84 reduced however to a pure midas principle capitalism could only end up by destroying everything in existence with which it came into contact but if capitalism has now failed the question becomes what next what next in his magisterial marxist historian eric hobsbawm viewing the approach of the twenty first century indicated that there were reasons to be concerned that the new century might be even more threatening to humanity than the age of extremes that had preceded it a century that had been punctuated by world wars imperial conflicts and economic depressions and in which humanity was confronted for the first time with the possibility of its own self annihilation yet looking forward he concluded the new century and millennium offered even greater dangers we live in a world hobsbawm observed in 1994 uprooted and transformed by the titanic economic and the techno scientific process of the development of capitalism which has dominated the past two or three centuries we know or at least it is reasonable to suppose that it cannot go on ad infinitum the future cannot be a continuation of the past and there are signs both externally and as it were internally that we have reached a point of historic crisis the forces generated by the techno scientific economy are now great enough to destroy the environment that is to say the material foundations of human life the structures of human societies themselves including even some of the social foundations of the capitalist economy are on the point of being destroyed by the erosion of what we have inherited from the human past our world risks both explosion and implosion it must change we do not know where we are going we only know that history has brought us to this point and if readers share the argument of this book why however one thing is plain if humanity is to have a recognizable future it cannot be by prolonging the past or the present if we try to build the third millennium on that basis we shall fail and the price of failure that is to say the alternative to a changed society is darkness 85 hobsbawm left little doubt as to what the principal danger was at present namely the theological faith in an economy in which resources were allocated entirely by the totally unrestricted market under conditions of unlimited competition carried out by evermore concentrated corporations chief among the dangers of such a system was the likelihood of irreversible and catastrophic consequences for the natural environment of this planet including the human race which is part of it 86 hobsbawm s position was roundly criticized at the time even by many on the left as overly pessimistic with regard to the course of capitalist development 87 today however a quarter century later it is clear that he hit the mark as the concerns that he voiced then are even more evident today nevertheless such realism in approaching the failure of capitalism in our time is still rare on the part of left intellectuals in the wealthy countries even in the face of decades of neoliberal assault combined with economic stagnation financialization growing inequality and environmental decline one common response is to refer to polanyi s notion of a double movement in which the recurring myth of a self regulating market society inevitably gives rise to defensive movements to protect society and the environment 88 this has fed the hope that the pendulum will swing back again leading to a more affirmative style liberalism or social democracy this sustains the belief that the failures of unregulated capitalism can be countered by a return to regulated capitalism a new keynesian age as if history had stood still pinning hopes on a double movement of this kind however denies four material realities first social democracy came about and persisted only as long as the threat of actually existing socialist societies was present and union strength endured and faded immediately with the demise of both second neoliberalism today is ingrained in capitalism itself in the phase of monopoly financial capital the earlier age of industrial capital dominance on which keynesian economics was based is now gone third social democracy was in practice reliant on an imperialist system that was opposed to the interests of the vast majority of humankind fourth the liberal democratic state and the dominance of a purportedly enlightened industrial capitalist class willing to engage in a social accord with labor is largely a relic of the past with its structural bases having all but disappeared even when social democratic parties come to power in these circumstances promising to work within the system and create a kinder and gentler capitalism they invariably fall prey to the laws of motion of capitalism in this phase as michael yates writes in the context of a failed capitalism today it is impossible to believe that there will be a recovery of even the modest political and economic project that labor unions and political parties once embraced and helped bring to fruition 89 on the so called liberal left some have adopted a broad technological modernization approach largely disregarding social relations here in an implicit technological determinism digital technology social engineering and wise liberal management are expected to reign supreme it is true such thinkers argue that the capitalist absolutism of neoliberalism points to unending disaster but capitalism can be altered presumably from above to fit any exigency even the sidelining of profits and accumulation conforming to current technological imperatives what will remain of the system in this conception will be the bare frames of corporations and markets now devoid of any class or acquisitive drive mere engines of efficiency as jørgen randers one of the original limits to growth authors declares in 2052 his forecast in 2012 of the world society forty years into the future that the modified capitalism that will emerge mid point in this century will be a system wherein collective well being is set above the return of the individual modified capitalism will be subject to the guidance of wise government directed by technocrats while being characterized by less democracy and less market freedom rather than directly facing up to the failures of capitalism though he projects forty years of economic stagnation for the major economic powers and continued poverty in the rest of the world randers sees such questions as largely irrelevant to his vision of the world in 2052 the dominant reality he predicts will be a more efficient and sustainable if more physically constrained version of the present day capitalist world 90 yet in the barely seven years since his book was written it is already clear that randers s predictions were wrong in every respect the situation confronting the world is qualitatively more serious than it was in 2012 at a time when gradualist technocratic solutions to climate change still seemed feasible to many even among those on the left and when the liberal democratic state appeared perfectly stable today in the context of accelerated climate change continuing economic stagnation political upheaval and growing geopolitical instability it is clear that the challenges that the world is facing will be both more cataclysmic and epoch making than progressive ecological modernizers like randers envisioned the choices confronting us are now much harder indeed history has been unkind to all such attempts to provide detailed forecasts of the future particularly if they simply extend current trends and leave the bulk of humanity and their struggles out of the picture it is for this reason that a dialectical view is so important the actual course of history can never be predicted the only thing certain about historical change is the existence of the struggles that drive it forward and that guarantee its discontinuous character both implosions and explosions inevitably materialize rendering the world for new generations different than that of the old history points to numerous social systems that have reached the limits of their ability to adapt their social relations to allow for the rational and sustainable use of developing productive forces hence the human past is dotted by periods of regression followed by revolutionary accelerations that sweep all before them as the conservative historian jacob burckhardt declared in the nineteenth century a historical crisis occurs when a crisis in the whole state of things is produced involving whole epochs and all or many peoples of the same civilization the historical process is suddenly accelerated in terrifying fashion developments which otherwise take centuries seem to flit by like phantoms in months or weeks and are fulfilled he called this the acceleration of historical processes 91 burckhardt principally had in mind social revolutions like the french revolution of 1789 this was an acceleration of history that as the modern french historian georges lefebvre explained commenced as a series of widening revolutions mutating with terrifying speed from an aristocratic revolution to a bourgeois revolution to a popular revolution and then a peasant revolution finally taking on the character of a historic bloc a single thing seemingly unconquerable which reshaped much of world history 92 could such a revolutionary acceleration of history though on an incomparably greater scale happen in the twenty first century most establishment commentators in the hegemonic countries of the world imperialist system would say no based on their own narrow experience and limited view of history nevertheless revolutions continue to break out in the periphery of the world system and are even now only put down by imperialist economic political and military interventions moreover the failure of capitalism on a planetary scale today threatens all of civilization and life on the planet as we know it if drastic changes are not made global temperature this century will increase by 4 or even 6 c from preindustrial times leading to conditions that will imperil humankind as a whole meanwhile the extreme capitalism of today seeks to expropriate and enclose all the bases of material existence siphoning off almost the entire net social surplus and robbing the natural environment for the direct benefit of a miniscule few as a direct result of capitalist social relations the material challenges now facing humanity are greater than anything ever seen before pointing to an accumulation of catastrophe along with the accumulation of capital 93 hundreds of millions of people under these circumstances are already being drawn into struggles with the system creating the basis of a new worldwide movement toward socialism in his book can the working class change the world yates answers yes it can but it can only do so through a unifying struggle by workers and peoples aimed at genuine socialism 94 it may be objected that socialism has been tried and has failed and hence no longer exists as an alternative however like the earliest attempts at capitalism in the italian city states of the late middle ages which were not strong enough to survive amongst the feudal societies that surrounded them the failure of the first experiments at socialism presage nothing but its eventual rebirth in a new more revolutionary more universal form which examines and learns from the failures 95 even in failure socialism has this advantage over capitalism it is motivated by the demand for freedom in general rooted in substantive equality and sustainable human development reflecting precisely those collective social relations borne of historical necessity and the unending struggle for human freedom crucial to human survival in our time 96 the great conservative economist joseph schumpeter who as austrian finance minister in red vienna had allied himself for a time with the socialist government and found himself attacked on all sides once wrote that capitalism would perish not because of the weight of economic failure but rather because its very success in pursuing its narrow economic ends had undermined the sociological foundations of its existence capitalism schumpeter exclaimed inevitably creates conditions in which it will not be able to live and which strongly point to socialism as its heir apparent 97 he was it turns out in many ways correct though not entirely in the way he expected the global development of monopoly capitalism and financialization spearheaded by the very same counterrevolutionary neoliberalism that first arose in response to red vienna in the interwar years at a time when schumpeter himself was a major actor has now undermined the material bases not so much of capitalism itself but of global society and planetary ecology the result has been the emergence of an atmosphere of almost universal hostility to the prevailing social order though playing out in the confused context of the present less as opposition to capitalism itself than to neoliberalism 98 it is capitalism s undermining of the very basis of human existence that will eventually compel the world s workers and peoples to seek new roads forward an inclusive class based movement toward socialism in this century will open up the possibility of qualitative new developments that the anarchy of the capitalist market society with its monopolistic competition extreme inequality and institutionalized greed cannot possibly offer 99 this includes the development of a socialist technology in which both the forms of technology utilized and the purposes to which they are put are channeled in social directions as opposed to individual and class gain 100 it introduces the prospect of long term democratic planning at all levels of society allowing decisions to be made and distributions to occur outside the logic of the cash nexus 101 socialism in its most radical form is about substantive equality community solidarity and ecological sustainability it is aimed at the unification not simply division of labor once sustainable human development rooted not in exchange values but in use values and genuine human needs comes to define historical advance the future which now seems closed will open up in a myriad ways allowing for entirely new more qualitative and collective forms of development 102 this can be seen in the kinds of needed practical measures that could be taken up but which are completely excluded under the present mode of production it is not physical impossibility or lack of economic surplus most of which is currently squandered that stands in the way of the democratic control of investment or the satisfaction of basic needs clean air and water food clothing housing education health care transportation and useful work for all it is not the shortage of technological know how or of material means that prevents the necessary ecological conversion to more sustainable forms of energy 103 it is not some inherent division of humanity that obstructs the construction of a new international of workers and peoples directed against capitalism imperialism and war 104 all of this is within our reach but requires pursuing a logic that runs counter to that of capitalism humanity karl marx wrote inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation 105 the very waste and excess of today s monopoly finance capitalism together with the development of new means of communication that allow for greater human coordination planning and democratic action than ever before suggest that there are countless paths forward to a world of substantive equality and ecological sustainability once the world is freed from the fetters of capital 106 the answers to the crises before us are both social and ecological they require the rational regulation of the metabolism between human beings and nature under the control of associated humanity regenerating and maintaining the flows cycles and other vital processes of healthy local regional and global ecosystems and species habitats in accord with the needs of the entire chain of human generations the mainsprings of human action throughout history lie in the drive for human freedom and the struggle to master our relation to the world the first of these ultimately demands equality and community the second human development and sustainability it is on these struggles for collective advancement that we must ultimately rely if humanity is to have a future at all notes
sovereignty in a globalised world speech by mario draghi president of the ecb on the award of laurea honoris causa in law from università degli studi di bologna bologna 22 february 2019 it is a great honour to be speaking here today at the university of bologna as europe s oldest university it has been at the heart of education and learning in europe for over 900 years it has a long history of welcoming students from across the continent including thomas becket and copernicus erasmus studied here in 1506 and the university of bologna is today a leading participant in the student exchange programme that bears his name the erasmus programme is one of the many examples of the benefits of the close cooperation within the european union that enjoy widespread popularity but we know that other elements of european integration are more contested today at the root of this debate is the inherent tension between the clear gains of economic integration and the cooperation that is necessary to bring it about which can sometimes be politically difficult to achieve or explain i would like to argue that in many ways this tension is illusory rather than taking away countries sovereignty the eu offers them a way to regain it this does not mean we need the eu for everything but in the face of globalisation the eu is more relevant than ever today as jean monnet said we need a europe for that which is essential a europe for what nations cannot do alone sovereignty in an interconnected world on the whole european citizens appear to welcome the benefits brought about by economic integration through the eu the free movement of people goods and services that is the single market is routinely seen by citizens as the eu s most positive achievement in the euro area 75 of people are in favour of the euro and monetary union and 71 of europeans support the eu s common trade policy yet at the same time public attitudes towards the eu s political structures seem to be hardening average trust in the eu stands at 42 down from 57 in 2007 this decline has taken place against the backdrop of a general loss of faith in public institutions trust in national governments and parliaments has dropped to just 35 this tension between economic integration and political cooperation is fuelled by a powerful belief that there is an inherent trade off between eu membership and the ability of countries to exercise sovereignty in this way of thinking if citizens want to be able to exert more control over their destinies they have to loosen the eu s political structures but this belief is wrong it is wrong because it conflates independence with sovereignty true sovereignty is reflected not in the power of making laws as a legal definition would have it but in the ability to control outcomes and respond to the fundamental needs of the people what john locke defines as their peace safety and public good the ability to make independent decisions does not guarantee countries such control in other words independence does not guarantee sovereignty countries that are completely shut off from the global economy to take an extreme but instructive example are independent but not sovereign in any meaningful sense often relying on external food aid to feed their people yet being connected through globalisation also increases the vulnerability of individual countries in many ways they are more exposed to financial spillovers and to the aggressive trade policies of foreign states while increased competition makes it harder for states to coordinate with one another to enforce regulations and set standards so as to achieve their social goals this restricts their control over domestic economic conditions in this environment countries need to work together to exercise sovereignty and this applies even more within the eu cooperation within europe helps protect states from external pressures and it helps enable their policy choices working together to protect globalisation has profoundly changed the nature of global production and deepened the ties that exist between countries cross border holdings of financial assets are now around 200 of global gdp compared with about 70 in 1995 foreign trade has increased from around 43 of global gdp in 1995 to about 70 today and around 30 of foreign value added is now created through global value chains at the global level this process has been driven not just by policy choices but in large part also by technological progress businesses have capitalised on the advances in transportation telecoms and computing that make it easier to trade globally and fragment production previous policy decisions and geographic proximity make the eu by far the most important trading area for european economies the majority of world trade takes place within three main trading blocs the eu the north american free trade agreement nafta and asia and though linkages have grown between those blocs they remain relatively closed to one another the ratio of extra regional trade to gdp in these regions is below 15 the eu is the most integrated of these blocs two thirds of eu countries trade is with other member states compared with about half for the nafta region around 50 of euro area cross border financial holdings are from other euro area countries practically speaking this means that italy exports more to spain than to china and more to austria than to russia or japan in 2017 german direct investment in italy was five times higher than that of the united states europe has profited a great deal from this integration it is estimated that the single market raises gdp in the eu by around 9 taking into account both the direct trade and competition effects but as countries become more interlinked they also become more exposed to volatile capital flows unfair competition or discriminatory actions and this necessitates greater protection for their citizens that protection which eu countries have created together has allowed them to garner the benefits of openness while limiting to some extent its costs the eu s common structures and institutions contain spillovers ensure a level playing field and prevent unjust behaviour in other words they respond to the needs of citizens and allow countries to exercise sovereignty thus the council and the european parliament set common rules for the whole eu the commission ensures they are observed and the european court of justice ecj provides for judicial protection if they are violated in the euro area european banking supervision and the single resolution mechanism help to contain the effects of financial instability in this interconnected environment seeking independence from eu institutions presents complex trade offs countries either have to accept rules decided by others to ensure continued access to the european market which gives them less control over decisions that affect their citizens interests or they have to disentwine themselves from their most important trading partners which gives them less control over their citizens welfare if trade barriers were to be reintroduced within europe it is estimated that gdp would be about 8 lower in germany and 7 lower in italy the case for working together to enhance sovereignty also applies to the relationship between the eu and the rest of the world few european economies are sizeable enough to withstand spillovers from large economies or to leverage power in external trade negotiations but cooperating at the eu level increases their potential to do so the eu accounts for 16 5 of global economic output second only to china which gives european countries a large domestic market to fall back on in the event of trade disruptions eu trade makes up 15 of world trade compared with around 11 for the united states providing the eu with significant weight in trade negotiations and the euro is the world s second most traded international currency which helps insulate the euro area economy from exchange rate volatility indeed around 50 of extra euro area imports are now invoiced in euro which reduces the pass through of exchange rate volatility to import prices that in turn allows monetary policy to focus more on euro area economic developments rather than having to react repeatedly to external shocks for all these reasons being outside the eu might lead to more policy independence but not necessarily to greater sovereignty the same is true of the single currency most countries would no longer benefit from local currency invoicing which would exacerbate the effects on inflation if they undertook large exchange rate devaluations and they would be more exposed to monetary policy spillovers from abroad not least from the ecb itself which could constrain their domestic policy autonomy in recent years denmark sweden switzerland and central and eastern european economies have been affected by spillovers from our policy measures in fact spillovers from larger economies were one reason why the euro was created in the first place under the european monetary system that preceded the euro most central banks had to follow the policy of the bundesbank after more than a decade of disappointing if not devastating experiences it was deemed preferable to regain monetary policy sovereignty by launching the single currency together cooperation and economic policy the second way in which globalisation constrains sovereignty is by limiting countries capacity to set laws and standards that reflect their social goals global trade integration tends to reduce that capacity because as production fragments through value chains there is a greater need for countries to agree on common standards those standards are mostly set not within the world trade organization but by large economies with dominant positions in the value chain smaller economies tend to end up as rule takers in the international system global financial integration can likewise reduce individual countries power to regulate tax and uphold labour standards multinational firms can influence national regulations through the threat of relocation as well as arbitrage tax systems by shifting income flows and intangible assets across jurisdictions there can also be incentives for countries to use labour standards as a tool of international competition the so called race to the bottom this makes it more difficult for countries to enforce their core values and protect their people it also leads to corporate tax bases being eroded which makes it harder to finance welfare states oecd analysis for example estimates global revenue losses from tax avoidance to be in the range of 4 to 10 of corporate income tax revenues these effects occur when countries are not large enough to exercise regulatory power against mobile capital or cross border firms but it is harder for this to happen at the level of the eu since it represents a market that companies can ill afford to leave having regulatory power at the eu level enables eu countries to exercise sovereignty in the areas of taxation consumer protection and labour standards first the eu gives its members the capacity to prevent multinationals from avoiding corporation tax by exploiting loopholes or extracting subsidies this is a complex area but some recent progress has been made on this front new european rules have entered into force this year to eliminate the most common corporate tax avoidance practices and while the ecj recently ruled against the commission in a tax exemption case it also recalled that special tax deals between multinationals and individual countries can constitute illegal state aid which the commission has the right to examine second the eu offers much greater possibilities to defend consumers values and ensure that they are treated fairly within the european market this has been visible in the eu s ability to enforce its values concerning privacy through the general data protection regulation it has been visible too in eu regulations to bring down mobile phone roaming charges for consumers within europe or to ensure that they cannot be charged more for cross border payments in euro within the eu than they would be for national transactions the third advantage is that countries have the possibility to coordinate within the eu to defend social protections without imposing trade restrictions through the charter of fundamental rights eu law has reduced the possibility of unfair competition from jurisdictions with laxer labour laws and it has also helped raise labour standards within the eu a case in point is the european directive on part time work in 1997 which reduced certain forms of discrimination that were still in place in 10 of the then 15 eu member states including italy oecd analysis finds that over time the introduction of equal treatment laws was associated with an increased likelihood of people being awarded permanent contracts the same protections do not exist at the global level or are much weaker in other regional trading blocs such as nafta the history of the united states itself illustrates the difficulty of aligning the approaches of individual states to improve working conditions in the early 20th century there was a growing concern in several us states about the lack of a social safety net especially for the elderly but individual states feared that providing social security would impose in the words of the time a heavy tax burden on the industries of the state that would put them at a disadvantage in competition with neighboring states unburdened by a pension system the lack of coordination created a severe underprovision of social security which was exacerbated by the great depression in 1934 half of the population over 65 were in poverty this was only resolved through the passing of the federal social security act in 1935 which enabled states to coordinate in providing social security in a similar way the eu provides a powerful coordination function that allows countries to achieve goals that they could not realise alone and the eu is able in turn to export some of its standards globally the eu is the top trading partner of 80 countries compared with just over 20 for the united states that allows the eu to insist on higher labour and product standards abroad via trade agreements as well as protecting local producers at home the recent trade agreement with canada for example protects 143 european geographic indications the eu also has regulatory power that goes beyond trade agreements as exporters to the eu must meet its standards economies of scale result in the application of those standards to production in all countries this is known as the brussels effect in this way the eu de facto sets the global rules across a wide range of areas all this gives eu countries another unique capacity to ensure that globalisation is not a race to the bottom on standards rather the eu is able to pull global standards up to its own institutions and rules in an integrated regional and global economy the case for european countries to work together to exercise sovereignty is clear but while many would agree on the need for cooperation views differ over how best to organise it some would argue that looser more transactional cooperation led by national governments is sufficient and there are indeed several historical examples of successful agreements being forged by the coming together of willing states where all parties benefit equally loose cooperation can be sustainable one such example is the bologna process which has helped align higher education standards and ensure mutual recognition of university degrees across members of the council of europe but it is also clear that in cases where cooperation is more necessary the conditions for loose cooperation would not hold spillovers between larger and smaller economies are typically asymmetric coordination problems arise because there are incentives for countries to free ride or to undercut one another in these instances deeper modes of cooperation are essential to align countries interests the eu has thus far employed two methods of governance to facilitate cooperation in some cases we have invested common institutions with executive power such as the commission for trade policy or the ecb for monetary policy in others executive power remains with national governments with cooperation through common rules such as the framework for fiscal and structural policies these areas of economic policy were considered too specific to the situation of individual countries to be entrusted to a common body it was felt that the only possible form of governance was for countries to exercise national sovereignty thereby respecting their own specific set of circumstances a rules based approach was seen to be the only solution that was consistent with this vision but it is worthwhile to reflect on how successful this choice has been for the cases where executive power has been invested with institutions most would agree that the institutions have performed relatively well trade policy has been effective in opening up access to new markets the eu has in place 36 free trade agreements compared with 20 for the united states monetary policy has successfully fulfilled its mandate but for the areas that use a rules based approach some shortcomings have been revealed the fiscal rules have provided a framework for assessing fiscal policies but have at times proven difficult to enforce and hard to explain to the public in the area of structural policies the country specific recommendations have had a limited impact with less than 10 of recommendations being substantially implemented each year the disparity between the outcomes of the two methods does not stem from any difference in the quality of european and national authorities instead it is a consequence of the inherent difference between rules and institutions there are two reasons why institutions have proven superior first rules are generally static and require countries to adhere to specific actions whereas institutions are required to achieve prescribed objectives rules therefore cannot be updated quickly when unforeseen circumstances arise whereas institutions can be dynamic and employ flexibility in their approaches that distinction matters hugely when underlying parameters and economic relationships change as they often do the distinction also matters for citizens who ultimately care most about the results of economic policy rather than the actions taken by governments the ecb s monetary policy during the crisis is an example of the greater flexibility of action afforded by an institution based approach the ecb was faced with a range of challenges that few could have predicted when our mandate was defined but the treaty combines our mandate for price stability with discretion over the tools we could use to achieve it this allowed us to deploy a range of unconventional policy tools to ensure that inflation remained in line with our aim neither operating monetary policy according to a fixed rule nor restricting ourselves to conventional policy tools would have sufficed discretion and flexibility in the use of our tools helped to strengthen our credibility flexibility and credibility were in this instance mutually reinforcing by contrast rules lose credibility if they are applied with discretion rules will be undermined if countries find reasons to circumvent them or rewrite them as soon as they bind but circumstances will always arise which were not foreseen at the time the rules were written and which call for flexibility in the case of rules there is an inevitable trade off between credibility and flexibility this is why there are always tensions when it comes to economic policies that follow the rules based approach but the transition to an institutions based approach requires trust between countries and trust is based on strict compliance with the existing rules but also on the ability of governments to reach mutually satisfactory compromises when the circumstances call for flexibility and to explain them adequately to their citizens that transition nevertheless remains necessary the european commission s recent initiative on the international role of the euro provides a further example of the need to move from the current framework of various laws and ad hoc rules to a system based on harmonisation and institutions rising trade tensions and the growing use of sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy have meant that the laws of the united states are increasingly being applied outside its jurisdiction this takes the form of penalties for societies outside the united states and the prevention of access to the us payment system and is based on the central role played by the us financial system and the us dollar in global trade several european governments believe that this situation could be mitigated by increasing the international role of the euro but if markets are to entertain the possibility of an enhanced role for the euro we need to consider what the conditions are that underpin the dollar s dominance the list is long but the fact that the dollar is an expression of an integrated capital market is certainly one of those conditions for the eu to meet that condition which at this stage of its development is more achievable than others would require a complex programme of legislative and institutional harmonisation which however could be put in place in short order the second reason why an institutional approach can help produce better outcomes is that institutions and their actions can be subject to more clearly defined democratic control precisely because those institutions are invested with a mandate and defined powers it is possible to make a more direct link between decisions and responsibility the eu already has many channels through which its citizens can exercise democratic control via national authorities in the eu council and members of the european parliament who hold eu institutions accountable on behalf of the people who elected them in fact for the first time on record a majority of europeans now feel that their voice counts in the eu it is to be hoped that accountability arrangements to hold eu institutions in check continue to be strengthened because the perception of the legitimacy of their actions depends on it the role of the european parliament is vital here of the institutions with a democratic mandate to exercise control it is the only one with a european perspective the european court of justice provides a second avenue of democratic control its role in ensuring that eu institutions are following their mandates becomes all the more important in the absence of a european government adherence to the judgments of the ecj is a necessary condition of the rule of law consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of eu law across 28 member states are the bedrocks of eu law as an effective and autonomous legal order a basic function of the law is to stabilise expectations by providing a reliable foundation upon which citizens and companies can organise their activity and plan for the future and such predictability and certainty is especially important for economic and monetary union today conclusion in today s world technological financial and commercial interlinkages are so powerful that only the very largest countries are able to be independent and sovereign at the same time and even they cannot do so entirely for most other nation states including the european countries these two characteristics do not coincide the european union is the institutional framework that has allowed the member states to be sovereign in many areas it is a shared sovereignty which is preferable to none at all it is a complementary sovereignty to the one exercised by individual nation states in other areas it is a sovereignty that europeans like the european union has been a political success built within the international order that emerged after the second world war it has been a faithful interpreter of the values of freedom peace and prosperity on which that order was founded the european union has been an economic success because it has provided an environment in which the energies of its citizens have created widespread and lasting prosperity founded on the single market and protected by the single currency the last decade has dramatically highlighted the shortcomings of national policies and the need for cooperation to evolve both within the eu and beyond a long global economic crisis unprecedented migration flows and inequality exacerbated by large concentrations of wealth resulting from technological progress have given rise to rifts in a political and economic order that was thought to be set change is necessary but there are different ways of bringing it about one prospect is that age old ideas that have shaped most of our history are revived such that the prosperity of some cannot be achieved without the poverty of others international and supranational organisations lose their relevance as places for negotiating and finding compromise solutions the affirmation of the self of the identity becomes the first requirement of every policy in such a world freedom and peace become accessories which can be dispensed with as needed but if we want these values to remain essential fundamental the path is a different one adjusting existing institutions to change this process of adjustment has so far encountered resistance because the inevitable national political difficulties always seemed to be above such need this reluctance has resulted in uncertainty about the capacity of institutions to respond to events and has strengthened the voice of those who want to pull down these institutions there should be no doubt this adjustment will have to be as deep as the phenomena that revealed the fragility of the existing order and as vast as the dimensions of a geopolitical order that is changing in a way that is not favourable for europe the european union wanted to create a sovereign where there was not one it is not surprising that in a world where every point of contact between the great powers is increasingly a point of friction the external challenges to the existence of the european union become increasingly threatening there is only one answer recovering the unity of vision and action that alone can hold together such different countries this is not only a hope but an aspiration based on political and economic advantage but there are also internal challenges that have to be faced which are no less important for the future of the european union we need to respond to the perception that it lacks equity between countries and social classes we need first to listen and then to act and explain so unity and equity are needed above all as a guide for policymaking in europe i would like to recall in closing the words of pope emeritus benedict xvi in a famous speech held 38 years ago to be sober and to do what is possible and not to claim with a burning heart the impossible has always been difficult the voice of reason is never as loud as an irrational cry but the truth is that political morals consist precisely in resisting the seductions of magniloquent words it is not moral the moralism of adventure it is not the absence of all compromise but the compromise itself that is the true moral of political activity
feb 21 2019 alasdair macleod this article makes the obvious point that a return to a gold standard is the only way nations can contain the interest cost of servicing debt given the alternative is inflationist policies that can only lead to far higher interest rates and currency destruction the topic is timely given the self harm of american economic and geopolitical policies which are already leading america into a cyclical slump meanwhile american fears of asian domination of global economic monetary and political outcomes have come true the upcoming credit crisis is likely to kill off the welfare state model in the west by destroying their unbacked paper currencies while china russia and their asian allies have the means to prosper the fragility of state finances in my last goldmoney article i explained why the monetary policies of inflationist economists and policy makers would end up destroying fiat currencies the destruction will come from ordinary people who are forced by law to use the state s money for settling their day to day transactions ordinary people each one a trinity of production consumption and saving will eventually wake up to the fraud of monetary inflation and discard their government s medium of exchange as intrinsically worthless they always have eventually this has been proved by experience and should be uncontroversial for the issuer of a currency the risk of this happening heightens when credit markets become destabilised and confidence in the full faith and credit which is the only backing a fiat currency has begins to be questioned either by its users or foreigners or both and when it does a currency starts to rapidly lose purchasing power and the whole interest rate structure moves higher the state s finances are then ruined because by that time the state will have accumulated a lethal combination of existing unrepayable debt and escalating welfare liabilities today most governments including the us are already ensnared in this debt trap only the public has yet to realise the consequences and the planners are not about to tell them the difficulty for nearly all governments is the deterioration in their finances will eventually wipe out their currencies unless a solution is found there is a solution that if taken allows the state to survive it could be modelled on steve hanke s of john hopkins university preferred solution of a currency board that when strictly observed removes the state s ability to create money out of thin air he recommends this solution to currency debasement and the evils that come with it for venezuela and the like linking a distressed emerging market currency to the dollar but here we are considering stabilising the dollar itself and all the other currencies linked to it the currency board in this case can only be linked to gold which has always been the peoples money free of issuer risk in former times this was the basis of a gold exchange standard professor hanke s currency board is a rule based system designed to achieve the same thing once the system is in place every currency unit subsequently put into public circulation by the monetary authority must be physically backed by a defined weight of gold bullion this was the method of the gold exchange standard adopted by the bank of england under the terms of the bank charter act of 1844 a modern currency board consisting of digitised currency effectively works the same way a currency board system is not the best mechanism whereby currency is made exchangeable for gold its weakness is it relies on the state fulfilling its obligations so it would be better to use gold directly either in physical or digitised form america reneged on its gold exchange standard in 1933 34 when it first banned gold ownership and then devalued the dollar that was simply theft by the state from its citizens therefore other safeguards for a gold exchange standard must be in place a return to a credible gold exchange standard will then put a cap on interest rates and therefore government borrowing costs instead of nominal rates of 10 going on 20 and beyond a gold exchange standard will probably cap long term government borrowing rates in a two to five per cent range it also allows businesses with viable investment plans to progress as well not only is it an obvious solution but it is similar to that adopted in the uk following the napoleonic wars britain had government debt levels in 1815 greater than that of all advanced nations today relative to the size of her economy with the single exception of japan she introduced the gold sovereign coin in 1816 comprised of 0 2354 ounces of gold as circulating money with a face value of one pound over the following nine decades not only did she pay down her government debt from over 200 of gdp to about 30 but her economy became the most advanced and wealthy in the world this was achieved with sound money whose purchasing power rose significantly over those nine decades while the quality of life for everyone improved a sovereign was still one pound only it bought much more ordinary people were encouraged to work spend and save they aspired to make their families better off the vast majority succeeded and for those few unfortunates who fell by the wayside charitable institutions were set up by successful philanthropists to provide both housing and employment it was never the function of the state to support them it would be too much to claim that it was a perfect world or indeed that everyone behaved as gentlefolk with the best of victorian values but the difference between the successful laissez faire economy in britain with its relatively minor faults compared with the bureaucratic socialism that succeeded it is stark the key is in the creation and preservation of personal wealth contrasting with socialist redistribution and wealth destruction which has steadily undermined formerly successful economies the future is coalescing towards an inflationary collapse for all western governments the manner of which is described in more detail in the following section for prescient politicians it creates the opportunity to reverse out of socialism because the silent majority which just wants commercial stability in preference to state handouts if properly led will support a move away from destructive socialism it is not a simple task because all advice that a politician receives today is predicated on the creed of inflationism and socialist imperatives why and how an inflationary collapse occurs monetarists are fully aware that if a government increases the quantity of money in circulation its purchasing power declines their theory is based on the days when gold was money and describes the effect of imports and exports of monetary gold on the general price level pure monetarists appear to assume the same is basically true of fiat currencies unbacked by gold but there is a fundamental difference when gold is used as money for settling cross border trade an arbitrage takes place correcting price differentials when prices are generally low in one country that country would achieve sales of commodities and goods in other countries where prices were higher gold then flows to the lower price centre raising its prices towards those of other countries with unbacked national currencies this does not happen instead national currencies earned through cross border trade are usually sold in the foreign exchanges and the determinant of trade flows is no longer an arbitrage based on a common form of money the pure link between money and trade has gone and whether foreigners retain or sell currency earned by exports depends mostly on their confidence in it that is a matter for speculation not trade domestic users of state issued currency are divorced from these issues because foreign currencies do not circulate domestically as a medium of exchange instead of being a form of money accepted beyond national boundaries as gold was formerly there is no value anchor for domestic use for this reason a national currency s purchasing power becomes a matter of trust and it is that trust that risks being undermined in a credit crisis the less trustworthy a government the more rapidly a currency is in risk of decline this is why monetarism which was based on gold as ubiquitous money is no longer the sole determinant of currency values it is true that an increase in the quantity of circulating money devalues the existing stock but if the population as a whole is prepared to increase its preference for money usually expressed as a savings ratio there need be no detrimental effect on its purchasing power with fiat currencies we enter a world where statistics reflect the quantity of money and never the confidence people have in it additionally we should observe that statistics can tell you everything and nothing but never the truth it is possible for an economy to collapse but statistically appear healthy as the following example illustrates imagine for a moment that modern statisticians and their methods existed at the time of the weimar republic government finances were covered by approximately ten per cent taxes and ninety per cent monetary inflation it was a government whose finances were run on the lines recommended by today s modern monetary theorists there can be no doubt the low level of taxation was an encouragement to business and permitted the redeployment of earnings for investment a falling exchange rate delivers excess profits for export businesses as well interest rates were attractive relative to the rate of price inflation and the economy statistically anyway was expanding rapidly this was certainly true measured in nominal gdp the basic measure of economic activity today official prices which are always the latest gathered and indexed lag monetary debasement by at least a month possibly two or even three to this we must also mention governments always under record price inflation which is the natural consequence of earlier debasement therefore even after an official price deflator is applied to nominal gdp real gdp growth in germany between 1918 and early 1923 would be judged by today s government economists to be booming interestingly joseph stiglitz and a raft of left leaning economists and politicians believed hugo chavez s socialist policies were successful in 2007 when statistics revealed a similar interpretation for venezuela s inflation ridden economy however instead of germany being deemed to be in an economic boom in 1920 economists in the classical and austrian traditions saw it for what it was even keynes wrote about it in his tract on monetary reform published coincidentally in late 1923 when the papiermark finally collapsed germany s inflation may have been a statistical success but it concealed crippling wealth destruction through the transfer of wealth and wages from private individuals to the state through monetary debasement as lenin is reputed to have said the way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them down between the millstones of taxation and inflation in germany inflationary financing started before the first world war to finance a build up of armaments at the outbreak of war gold convertibility was suspended and the unbacked papiermark began its inflationary drift exploiting the facility to issue valueless pieces of paper as currency and for the people to circulate them as legal tender became the principal source of government funds this trick worked until approximately may 1923 by then the purchasing power of the mark had fallen consistently at a relatively even pace it then took only seven months to lose all its purchasing power when the public collectively realised what was happening and manically dumped their marks for anything it was the katastrophenhausse or crack up boom the end of life for a state s unbacked currency it was the pattern firmly established in all fiat currency collapses which besides the currencies in existence today has happened to all of them throughout the history of post barter trade without any known exception it is the familiar route along which the dollar and other paper currencies are travelling today now that we are entering a statistical slowdown in most major economies weimar style financing is set to return to centre stage the fate for unbacked state currencies unless somehow averted will be the same the lesson from weimar and today s monetary inflation is that the period before the public cottons on to it can be prolonged in germany it was 1914 1923 followed by a swift seven month collapse today it is from 1971 and still counting but the final collapse could be as rapid as germany s between may and november 1923 doubtless we will see rising price inflation later this year but that statistic will continue to be suppressed with the gap between the effect of accelerating monetary inflation and the official rate of price inflation widening we could see for a brief period the statistical recovery in gdp that so badly misled professor stiglitz and others observing venezuela s economy twelve years ago a gold standard alone is insufficient a major problem for governments when price inflation begins to rise is the notional cost of borrowing because markets alive to the decline in the currency s purchasing power will drive interest rates higher despite official attempts to suppress them so far the problem has been successfully covered up by central banks rigging government debt markets and by government statisticians masking the true rate of price inflation through statistical trickery in future efforts to keep a lid on reality will presumably intensify as a core feature of monetary and economic policy in light of another wave of monetary debasement the question then arises whether markets will permit this market rigging to continue if not the purchasing power of unbacked currencies will be visibly undermined by the erosion of public confidence in them we cannot know this outcome for sure until it is well on the way the lehman credit crisis led to a global explosion in the quantity of money as central banks worked in tandem to rescue the banks and the entire financial world that injection still circulates in the global blood stream a second globally coordinated monetary debasement is just starting notably with china leading the way a realistic assumption must be that this time the purchasing power of state currencies will be the victim of a severe monetary overdose this being the case there is bound to be an upward adjustment in nominal interest rates forced on central banks by the markets government financing becomes overtly inflationary embarking on a modern equivalent of the papiermark route how else do you describe accelerated quantitative easing a loss of confidence in currencies is always reflected in the prices of gold and silver which by then should be heading considerably higher crypto currencies could compound the problem by becoming an alternative for people no longer content to retain bank deposits governments and their central banks will be at a fork in the road one direction towards monetary stability is rough tough suspension breaking but leads to a better place the other towards accelerating monetary debasement is smoother more familiar but just out of sight leads to a cliff edge of monetary destruction which road will your government take western governments are poorly equipped to make this decision there are a few people in the political establishment who might understand the choice but they will have to deliberately put the clock back and reverse government policy away from socialism and state regulation towards free markets and sound money they will be fighting the neo keynesian economic establishment the inflationists who form the overwhelming majority of experts and advisers these neo keynesians populate the central banks and government treasury departments almost to the exclusion of all other economic theorists spending ministers and secretaries of state will have to be told to reduce their power bases which goes against their personal ambitions and political instincts it will take an extraordinary feat of leadership to succeed in favour of a brave statesman will be the free market instincts of the silent majority it is only at times of crisis that a statesman can muster this support in a different context churchill in 1940 comes to mind the public will not know the solution but with the right leadership they can be led along the path to economic and monetary salvation the currency will have to be stabilised by making it convertible into gold bullion and government spending will have to be slashed by as much as a quarter or a third in most advanced economies this means enacting legislation cancelling government responsibilities something that could require a state of emergency the message to the electorate must be the government owes you nothing and so that you can look after yourself the government must encourage individuals to accumulate personal wealth by removing taxation from savings obviously the most socialist welfare states will face the greatest challenge there will be extreme tension between financial reality and entrenched interests there can be no doubt that their currencies are most likely to fail the eurozone poses a particular challenge with one currency circulating between nineteen member states conventional opinion is that all the troubles visited on the pigs portugal italy greece and spain are due to an inflexible currency here there is likely to be a split with germany and perhaps a northern faction gravitating towards the protection of a gold standard while the pigs will press for more interest rate suppression and infinite supplies of easy money from the ecb the us is a pivot of disaster the us has a different but more worrying problem it refuses to accept its decline as the dominant super power retreating into trade protection and autarky consequently the us government is taking destructive decisions since president trump was elected he accelerated inflationary financing late in the credit cycle in the belief it would lead to greater tax income in due course he has also replayed the smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 in the belief that trade protectionism somehow makes america great again maga instead it has crashed global trade just as it did in the 1930s maga is a fateful combination of tax cuts and trade protectionism it is a curious form of self harm which backfires badly on american consumers and corporations and it does not help foster good relations with america s creditors who have allowed america to live beyond her means for decades foreigners now own dollars in enormous amounts for which interpret they are america s reluctant bankers they are now beginning to be net sellers as a consequence of a dollar glut in their hands combined with america s clumsy geopolitical manoeuvrings tic data for december showed foreigners sold a net 91 4bn the largest monthly outflow during trump s presidency and this only a few months after everyone believed foreigners were buying yet more dollars to service their own debts while ignoring its dependency on foreign finance america is trying to strangle china s economic and technical development but that horse has already bolted washington surely knows the jig is up and that the us japan and britain are merely islands on the periphery of a vitalised eurasian powerhouse we were all warned this would happen in one form or another by halford mackinder over a hundred years ago america it appears is prepared to destroy herself rather than see mackinder s prophecy come true consequently the whole world is being thrown into a trade induced slump and the american government is central to the problem we can expect its economy along with all the others to decline significantly in the coming months it will be an encouragement for yet more inflationism the monetary expansion which is sure to follow is set to lead to an acceleration in the decline in the dollar s purchasing power as foreigners turn from dollar bankers to dollar sellers this will lead to an increase in the value of time preference set by markets and unless the fed counters this increase sufficiently by raising its rates the dollar will simply slide under current circumstances the 1980 81 volcker solution of raising interest rates to 20 to stabilise the currency does not appear to be available furthermore to reverse the nixon shock of 1971 and reinstate gold backing for the dollar as a means of limiting the rise in interest rates is simply not in the establishment s dna america which is very much the guilty party in destroying its own bretton woods monetary arrangements will find it very difficult to change its tack with such economic cluelessness at the top the sco bloc things are very different in asia the eight members of the shanghai cooperation organisation together with those seeking to join represent roughly half the world s population it is led by gold friendly china and russia a further two billion people can be said to be directly affected by the way the sco develops including the populous nations of south east asia the middle east and sub saharan africa that leaves america s questionable sphere of influence reduced to roughly one and a half billion souls out of a global population of seven it is proof of halford mackinder s foresight china and russia still have significant infrastructure plans which will stimulate eurasian economic activity for at least the next decade perhaps two if the formerly advanced national economies slump of course asia will be adversely affected but not as much as even china watchers fear the upcoming credit crisis is likely to mainly affect america uk western europe and their military and economic allies the sco bloc could escape relatively lightly if it takes the right avoiding action the threat to the sco s future is mainly from its current monetary policies with china in particular using credit expansion to manage the economy she has sought to control the consequences of domestic monetary policy through strict exchange controls a strategy which has so far broadly succeeded the growing possibility of a dollar collapse will call for a radical change in china s monetary policy we know the direction this new policy will take from the actions of russia china and increasingly those of other sco members and that is to somehow incorporate gold into their paper monies furthermore they are capable of doing it and making it stick while it is clear to us that china and russia understand the importance of gold as true money it is not clear whether they have a credible plan for its introduction into their monetary systems the russians seem to have a good grasp of the issues china had a good grasp but many of her economic advisors are now western trained in neo keynesian inflationary beliefs therefore china is not wholly immune to the faults that are likely to destroy the dollar and other western currencies but the central message in china s successful cornering of the physical gold market is a switch will be made to sound money when it is strategically sensible despite the neo keynesians in it ranks almost none of the sco nations have significant welfare commitments to their populations it is therefore possible for them to contain government spending in an economic downturn not only can russia and china introduce a gold exchange standard and make it stick but fellow sco members and those nations tied to it can either introduce their own gold exchange standards or alternatively use gold backed roubles and yuan to anchor their currencies the economic and monetary direction taken by the sco in the coming years could turn out to be relatively successful at least compared with the difficulties faced by the welfare states such an outcome would be immensely positive for humanity as a whole and be a lifeline for those of us deluded into inflation funded socialism you never know it might even force spendthrift western governments to reform their ways and return to sound money policies the effect on the price of gold should be obvious it is said that foreign students in berlin in 1923 were able to buy houses with the spare change from their allowances sent to them by their parents usually in dollars or pounds dollars at that time were as good as gold today a currency board or gold exchange standard would have to be fixed at a rate significantly higher than current fiat currency prices gold is the ultimate protection from theft by currency debasement mmt replicates the chartalist s state theory of money which became the end

london a cursory assessment might find the united states a less than ideal candidate for the job of managing the planet s ultimate form of money its public debt is enormous 22 trillion and growing its politics recently delivered the longest government shutdown in american history its banking system is only a decade removed from the worst financial crisis since the great depression its proudly nationalist president provokes complaints from allies and foes alike that he breaches the norms of international relations setting off talk that the american dollar has lost its aura as the indomitable safe haven but money tells a different story the dollar has in recent years amassed greater stature as the favored repository for global savings the paramount refuge in times of crisis and the key form of exchange for commodities like oil the enduring potency of the dollar gives force to president trump s mode of engagement it has enabled his treasury to find buyers for government savings bonds at enviably cheap rates even as his 1 5 trillion worth of tax cuts added to the debt it has reinforced mr trump s authority in imposing his foreign policies on an often reluctant world by amplifying the power of his trade sanctions especially against iran and venezuela

substantially in line with our previously provided outlook for 2018 during the quarter we returned 585 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends on a consolidated basis we posted sales of 10 1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 5 over the fourth quarter of 2017 this strong growth was achieved in a period in which global light vehicle production declined by 4 led by a 14 decline in china and a 1 decline in europe partly offset by an increase of 1 in north america excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and net acquisitions sales increased by 7

decreased by 10 from the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted ebit as a percentage of sales declined to 7 2 compared to 8 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the margin decline reflects lower margins in our power vision segment mainly associated with increased spending for electrification and autonomy higher launch costs a decline in equity income largely due to lower earnings at getrag s joint ventures in china and higher warranty expense an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our complete vehicles segment relative to total sales which have a significantly lower margin than our consolidated average and lower margins in our seating segment mainly associated with pre operating costs incurred at new facilities these factors were partially offset by higher margins in our body exteriors structures segment largely related to improved profitability at certain underperforming operations income from operations before income taxes of 607 million decreased 158 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease reflects lower adjusted ebit higher interest expense and higher other expense net each as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 net income attributable to magna international inc decreased 103 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower income from operations

release review of select fourth quarter 2018 financial information other expense net we recorded other expense net of 97 million 92 million after tax for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to 28 million 35 million after tax for the three months ended december 31 2017 these items had an unfavourable impact of 0 28 and 0 10 on diluted earnings per common share for the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively for further details refer to the other expense net section later in this press release income taxes on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax reform which reduced the u s federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 required companies to pay a one time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2017 we made a reasonable estimate of its effects on our deferred tax balances and the one time transition tax recognizing a provisional 23 million net reduction in income tax expense in 2017 at december 31 2018 we have completed our analysis of the impact of the us tax reform and recorded a net increase in income tax expense of 11 million in 2018 during 2018 we released a portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in india the valuation allowance was required due to historical losses and uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these deferred tax assets over the past few years some of our operations in india have delivered sustained profits which together with forecasted profits have allowed us to release the valuation allowance set up against the india deferred tax assets the effect of the valuation allowance release is a reduction of income tax expense of 17 million adjustments to valuation allowance us tax reform and the adjustments to valuation allowance together result in a net favourable impact of 0 02 and 0 06 on the diluted earnings per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively segment analysis body exteriors

sales of 10 1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 5 over the fourth quarter of 2017 this strong growth was achieved in a period in which global light vehicle production declined by 4

decreased by 10 from the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted ebit as a percentage of sales declined to 7 2 compared to 8 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the margin decline reflects lower margins in our power vision segment mainly associated with increased spending for electrification and autonomy higher launch costs a decline in equity income largely due to lower earnings at getrag s joint ventures in china and higher warranty expense an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our complete vehicles segment relative to total sales which have a significantly lower margin than our consolidated average and lower margins in our seating segment mainly associated with pre operating costs incurred at new facilities these factors were partially offset by higher margins in our body exteriors structures segment largely related to improved profitability at certain underperforming operations income from operations before income taxes of 607 million decreased 158 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease reflects lower adjusted ebit higher interest expense and higher other expense net each as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 net income attributable to magna international inc decreased 103 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower income from operations

the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax reform which reduced the u s federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 required companies to pay a one time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2017 we made a reasonable estimate of its effects on our deferred tax balances and the one time transition tax recognizing a provisional 23 million net reduction in income tax expense in 2017 at december 31 2018 we have completed our analysis of the impact of the us tax reform and recorded a net increase in income tax expense of 11 million in 2018 during 2018 we released a portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in india the valuation allowance was required due to historical losses and uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these deferred tax assets over the past few years some of our operations in india have delivered sustained profits which together with forecasted profits have allowed us to release the valuation allowance set up against the india deferred tax assets the effect of the valuation allowance release is a reduction of income tax expense of 17 million adjustments to valuation allowance us tax reform and the adjustments to valuation allowance together result in a net favourable impact of 0 02 and 0 06 on the diluted earnings per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively segment analysis body exteriors

accompanying this announcement is available at three months ended december 31 2018 our fourth quarter results were records for sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share and were substantially in line with our previously provided outlook for 2018 during the quarter we returned 585 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends on a consolidated basis we posted sales of 10 1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 5 over the fourth quarter of 2017 this strong growth was achieved in a period in which global light vehicle production declined by 4 led by a 14 decline in china and a 1 decline in europe partly offset by an increase of 1 in north america excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and net acquisitions sales increased by 7 on a consolidated basis and by segment 3 in power vision 15 in seating 43 in complete vehicles and a 1 decline in body exteriors structures adjusted ebit of 730 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased by 10 from the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted ebit as a percentage of sales declined to 7 2 compared to 8 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the margin decline reflects lower margins in our power vision segment mainly associated with increased spending for electrification and autonomy higher launch costs a decline in equity income largely due to lower earnings at getrag s joint ventures in china and higher warranty expense an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our complete vehicles segment relative to total sales which have a significantly lower margin than our consolidated average and lower margins in our seating segment mainly associated with pre operating costs incurred at new facilities these factors were partially offset by higher margins in our body exteriors structures segment largely related to improved profitability at certain underperforming operations income from operations before income taxes of 607 million decreased 158 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease reflects lower adjusted ebit higher interest expense and higher other expense net each as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 net income attributable to magna international inc decreased 103 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower income from operations before income taxes partially offset by a lower income tax rate diluted earnings per share decreased by 11 to 1 37 in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting lower net income attributable to magna international inc partly offset by the favourable impact of a reduced share count adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3 to 1 63 compared to 1 58 for the fourth quarter of 2018 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we generated cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1 0 billion and 597 million in operating assets and liabilities investment activities for the

months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively for further details refer to the other expense net section later in this press release income taxes on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax reform which reduced the u s federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning in 2018 required companies to pay a one time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2017 we made a reasonable estimate of its effects on our deferred tax balances and the one time transition tax recognizing a provisional 23 million net reduction in income tax expense in 2017 at december 31 2018 we have completed our analysis of the impact of the us tax reform and recorded a net increase in income tax expense of 11 million in 2018 during 2018 we released a portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in india the valuation allowance was required due to historical losses and uncertainty as to the timing of when we would be able to generate the necessary level of earnings to recover these deferred tax assets over the past few years some of our operations in india have delivered sustained profits which together with forecasted profits have allowed us to release the valuation allowance set up against the india deferred tax assets the effect of the valuation allowance release is a reduction of income tax expense of 17 million adjustments to valuation allowance us tax reform and the adjustments to valuation allowance together result in a net favourable impact of 0 02 and 0 06 on the diluted earnings per share for the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively segment analysis body exteriors

acquisitions net of divestitures during or subsequent to the fourth quarter of 2017 which positively impacted sales by 38 million partially offset by a 76 million unfavourable impact due to the

line with our previously provided outlook for 2018 during the quarter we returned 585 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends on a consolidated basis we posted sales of 10 1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 5 over the fourth quarter of 2017 this strong growth was achieved in a period in which global light vehicle production declined by 4 led by a 14 decline in china and a 1 decline in europe partly offset by an increase of 1 in north america excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and net acquisitions sales increased by 7 on a consolidated basis and by segment 3 in power vision 15 in seating 43 in complete vehicles and a 1 decline in body exteriors structures adjusted ebit of 730 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased by 10 from the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjusted ebit as a percentage of sales declined to 7 2 compared to 8 4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the margin decline reflects lower margins in our power vision segment mainly associated with increased spending for electrification and autonomy higher launch costs a decline in equity income largely due to lower earnings at getrag s joint ventures in china and higher warranty expense an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our complete vehicles segment relative to total sales which have a significantly lower margin than our consolidated average and lower margins in our seating segment mainly associated with pre operating costs incurred at new facilities these factors were partially offset by higher margins in our body exteriors structures segment largely related to improved profitability at certain underperforming operations income from operations before income taxes of 607 million decreased 158 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease reflects lower adjusted ebit higher interest expense and higher other expense net each as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 net income attributable to magna international inc decreased 103 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of lower income from operations before income taxes partially offset by a lower income tax rate diluted earnings per share decreased by 11 to 1 37 in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting lower net income attributable to magna

raise nzd 20b over the next five years to meet the rule rbnz deputy governor geoff bascand said the move would only lead to a marginal tightening of monetary conditions but he added that the central could consider to loosen up monetary further is needed bascand said when we set the ocr official cash rate we set it with for a 18 month to 2 year look ahead so let s say we are making a decision in the third quarter of this year we just have to feed that into our regular monetary policy decision making and if we were worried and thinking we were undershooting inflation undershooting maximum sustainable employment then we would obviously look for an ocr change that is the implication rba lowe what s of concern is accumulation of downside risks rba governor philip lowe said today that the central scenario for 2019 is for growth of around 3 inflation of around 2 and unemployment of around 5 and this is not a bad set of numbers however what is more of concern is the accumulation of downside risks the first major area of risks globally is political risks including us china trade and technology tensions brexit rise of populism and strains in some wester european countries second area of international risk is china slowdown domestically rba board has recently been paying particularly close attention to household spending and housing market lowe noted that underlying trend in consumption is softer than it earlier looked to be decline housing prices could also affect overall spending on monetary policy lowe reiterated that the probability that the next move is up and the probability that it is down are more evenly balanced than they were six months ago au fm cormann dalian coal ban unrelated to bilateral relationship between australia and china australian dollar tumbles broadly yesterday on news that china s dalian port banned the countries coal import but australian offices are quick to talk down the implication mathias cormann minister for finance said when decisions like this have been made in the past at local port level it was related to domestic supply related issues environmental issues at a local level cormann emphasized it was unrelated with anything to do with the bilateral relationship between australia and china rba governor philip low said i wouldn t jump yet to the conclusion that this is something directed to australia and it may well turn out to be that it s being driven by concerns about the environment in china and the profitability of the coking coal industry in china uk barclay cox to meet eu barnier again next week there appears to be no breakthrough on brexit for now brexit minister stephen barclay and attorney general geoffrey cox met eu chief brexit negotiator michel barnier yesterday they had productive meeting and discussed the positions of both ides and it s agreed that talks should now continue urgently at a technical level cox will explore legal options with the commission s team the trio will discuss again next week uk is seeking legal binding assurance that the irish border backstop would be temporary if triggered it s believed that once this issue is solved especially with the endorsement of cox the brexit deal would get through the commons however european commission president jean claude juncker was not very optimistic he noted that in the british parliament every time they are voting there

introduction secretary perdue deputy secretary censky usda chief economist rob johanssen usda staff my cftc colleagues and other distinguished guests thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight at united states department of agriculture s 95th outlook forum for almost a century this forum has brought together thought leaders to consider critical issues facing agriculture i applaud the department for this enduring institution it is tremendously important i am very honored to be speaking to you you know the chances were pretty slim that a guy like me from new jersey would ever become chairman of the u s commodity futures trading commission the odds were even thinner that two people commissioner russ behnam and i from the same country in new jersey would serve together at the cftc as we do today believe me the odds were almost impossible that a jersey guy would be the dinner speaker at the usda s big annual event but again this is america where amazing things happen all the time depth and diversity of american agriculture and you know there s a reason new jersey is called the garden state it is a top producer for such items as cranberries blueberries peaches bell peppers spinach and tomatoes its diversity of agriculture production compares favorably with america s largest fruit vegetable and nursery stock producing states it is notable that based on highest dollar value per acre new jersey is the most productive farmland in the united states and i know that secretary purdue is aware of this because he just spent a few days touring new jersey farms and meeting its producers our state and our country is fortunate to have such an agriculture secretary who is so tireless in understanding the concerns of american farms from the smallest patch to the largest expanse and fighting for their success back in 2014 when president obama nominated me to the commodity futures trading commission i made a commitment to the senate committee on agriculture that i would travel the country and meet with farmers and ranchers i promised to learn about their businesses and see first hand the challenges they face in 2017 when president trump nominated me to be chairman of the cftc i renewed that pledge to keep agriculture and its challenges front and center at the agency during my term i have travelled the country and visited farm country in over two dozen states from montana texas arkansas louisiana and iowa to minnesota missouri new york georgia mississippi and oklahoma i have walked in wheat fields and harvested soybeans tramped through rice farms and beneath pecan groves milked dairy cows and toured feed lots visited grain elevators and viewed cotton gins throughout i have been moved by the diverse beauty of this country i have come to love its farming families i know what a blessing that has been and what an education for a kid from jersey i was struck by the creative and innovative approaches underway in american agriculture they reflect fortitude and drive required to meet the challenges of the 21st century it is clear that producers are first and foremost business owners who must stay focused on developments in their industry both technologically and commercially food production in the 21st century requires enormous ingenuity technological savvy and expertise staying competitive in today s global economy requires new tools to keep up with growing world food demands while protecting the environment managing costs and risk and as we all know agriculture is a risky business which i believe is why i am here with you tonight commodity derivatives help manage production risk for more than a century american farmers have relied on u s derivatives markets to manage risk these markets allow farmers ranchers and producers to hedge production costs and delivery prices so that consumers can always find plenty of food on grocery store shelves they are one reason why american consumers enjoy stable prices not only in the supermarket but in all manner of consumer finance from auto loans to household purchases derivatives markets influence the price and availability of heating in american homes the energy used in factories the interest rates borrowers pay on home mortgages and the returns workers earn on their retirement savings commodity derivatives markets provide a critical source of information about future harvest prices a grain elevator uses the futures market as the basis for the price it offers local farmers at harvest in return farmers look to exchange prices to determine for themselves whether they are getting fair value for their production usda uses that same information to make price projections determine volatility measures and make payouts on crop insurance more than 90 of fortune 500 companies use derivatives to manage commercial or market risk in their worldwide business operations these markets allow the risks of variable production costs such as the price of raw materials energy foreign currency and interest rates to be transferred from those who cannot afford them to those who can in short derivatives serve the needs of american society to help moderate price supply and other commercial risks to free up capital for economic growth job creation and prosperity while often derided in the tabloid press as risky derivatives when used properly are tools for efficient risk transfer and mitigation it has been estimated that the use of commercial derivatives added 1 1 to the size of the u s economy between 2003 and 2012 us commodity futures are a global product today american derivatives markets are the world s largest most developed and most influential they are relatively unmatched in their depth and breadth providing deep pools of trading liquidity low transaction cost and friction and participation by a diverse array of global counterparties they are also some of the world s fastest growing and technologically innovative u s derivatives markets are also unmatched in efficient and undistorted price discovery the value of many of the world s most important agricultural mineral and energy commodities is reliably established in u s futures markets and those prices are set in u s dollars dollar pricing of the world s commodities provides an enormous and unparalleled advantage to american producers in global commerce the advantage being that with dollar pricing both producers and consumers do not need a currency hedge on top of their commodities hedges we cannot take for granted having the world s leading futures markets there have been serious new entrants like china the world s largest consumer of oil and fuel and a major global purchaser of iron ore for its world leading steel production china is opening its domestic futures markets to international participation it is also seeking to develop chinese commodity futures markets as viable regional price benchmarks for key industrial commodities slower growing economies like europe s also seek to increase their competitiveness against u s dollar pricing of global commodities these moves challenge us to ensure that america s well regulated derivatives markets remain open orderly and highly liquid we must do everything we can to ensure that they continue to provide domestic and international participants with the world s most accurate price discovery lowest friction execution and the deepest trading liquidity to borrow this forum s theme america s futures markets are grown locally and used globally let s keep it that way independent and effective market regulation american derivatives markets are also the world s best regulated the united states is the only major country in the organization for economic co operation and development to have a regulatory agency specifically dedicated to derivatives market regulation the cftc there is a connection between having the world s most competitive derivatives markets and effective federal regulation for over forty years the cftc has been recognized for its principles based regulatory framework and econometrically driven analysis the cftc is respected around the world for its depth of expertise and breadth of capability the combination of regulatory expertise and competency is one of the reasons why u s derivatives markets continue to serve the global need to hedge price and supply risk safely and efficiently it is why well regulated u s derivatives markets by allowing low cost and effective hedging are of great benefit to american producers and consumers and to the rest of the world as some of you might know the commission was established as an independent agency in 1974 assuming responsibilities that had previously belonged to the department of agriculture since the 1920s with regulatory authority over the commodity futures markets these markets have existed since the 1860s beginning with agricultural commodities such as wheat corn and cotton over time these commodity futures markets have grown to include those for energy and metals commodities such as crude oil heating oil gasoline copper gold and silver the agency now also oversees trading platforms for financial products such as interest rates stock indexes and foreign currency on the heels of the 2008 financial crisis congress passed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act giving the agency oversight of the more than 400 trillion swaps market which is about twelve times the size of the futures market yet the agency s value proposition is less about the enormous size of the markets it regulates but the effectiveness of its work and independence from political control the framers of the u s market regulatory structure wisely made the cftc an independent agency not under the direct control of the executive branch but subject to thoughtful oversight by congress the effect is to shield it from the political tempests of the times to regulate in the best interest of markets and not in furtherance of a broader political agenda having served under both the obama and trump administrations i have witnessed a consistent abstention from interference in the cftc s regulatory mission and that is right it is a credit to u s political institutions society may choose to address such concerns as climate change poverty or gender discrimination but they are properly addressed through legislative and executive initiative the job of regulators is to oversee trading markets that fairly value those concerns not promote or institute them i believe that insulation from political control and singular dedicated regulation are among the key reasons why u s markets remain the world s preeminent and interestingly despite being the most venerable u s futures markets are today among the fastest growing markets in the world their continued ability to attract global capital and investment reflects their universally recognized integrity and independence from particular government social monetary or political policies renewed focus on market evolution upon becoming chairman i made some institutional changes designed to refocus the agency on better understanding the current evolution of markets in 2017 we set up the market intelligence branch as part of the cftc s division of market oversight the work of the new branch is important it is to understand analyze and communicate current and emerging derivatives market dynamics developments and trends such as the impact of new technologies and trading methodologies the market intelligence branch is set up to increase the commission s knowledge of evolving market structures and practices in order to inform sound policymaking at the commission market intelligence staff provide a brief summary of market news twice daily and every friday they provide a report of key market developments to the commissioners and senior staff they also brief other u s financial regulators like the sec the federal reserve and the treasury in these briefings they cover the full range of derivatives markets financial markets energy markets and of course agricultural markets staff discuss the spectrum of issues affecting markets from weather to global trade in addition about once a month market intelligence and other cftc staff present their findings on a major research topic in the agriculture space these briefings have covered such matters as the impact of high frequency trading on futures markets and the effect of new block trading in grains markets in april of 2017 we also launched the cftc s first annual agricultural futures conference in kansas city the cftc along with kansas state university conducted a first of its kind conference called protecting america s agricultural markets an agricultural commodity futures conference i am proud to say that usda under secretary bill northey was the keynote at our conference last year panelists discussed current macro economic trends and issues affecting our markets like market speculation high frequency trading trade data transparency novel hedging practices and market manipulation participants looked at problems in convergence between cash and futures prices and volatile storage rates and heard about advances in distributed ledger technology algorithmic trading and other emerging digital technologies as well as current regulatory activities in protecting participants from manipulation fraud and other unlawful activities our common purpose was to hear from end users who use our markets to hedge risk and to consider and address issues of emerging market structure and trading practices to ensure that these markets remain the world s most robust dynamic and liquid for decades to come we will hold our second ag futures conference on april 11 12 2019 the program is excellent i hope to see many of you there renewed commitment to free markets as we focus our regulatory energies to better understand the changing dynamics of our commodity derivatives markets we cannot deny that much is changing and changing rapidly new emerging digital technologies are pulling our farmers and ranchers into a virtual future often beyond comprehension with a powerful gravitational pull they are entering this virtual world with worries about trade commerce costs and competition and as regulators we needed to listen and continue to listen the greater the pace of change the greater must be our capacity to keep pace understand and harness it yet amidst all this change i want to reassert for you tonight an enduring and true value that is the value proposition of free market capitalism the proposition that broad and sustained prosperity generally occurs wherever in the world there are open and competitive markets free of political interference combined with free enterprise personal choice voluntary exchange and legal protection of person and property this value proposition is a source of human expression aspiration and creativity freedom of choice is a social good in its own right a moral and economic imperative life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are about the freedom of the individual not just moral or political freedom but economic freedom as well freedom to live in a self directed manner and conduct commerce as one may determine under free market capitalism well regulated and well ordered trading activity is considered a forum of human self expression and economic advancement freedom to act in the marketplace is a part of freedom itself billions of consumers following their own self interests and individual needs make the decisions that direct the future not have it directed for them for an emerging generation fascinated by crowd sourcing free capital markets are the ultimate in crowd sourced decision making free markets should be the natural choice of today s youth who today and always aspire to bright and self actualized futures something that is no more freely and openly chosen than under free market capitalism conclusion a future of human potential i personally hope that we can renew faith in free markets for ourselves and our children we must not be afraid or be intimidated we must renew our confidence in the value of our free market model in so doing we best encourage and reward the initiative productivity drive and dreams of everyone on this planet not just for soybean growers in white cloud kansas dairy farmers in melrose minnesota or cotton producers in bardwell texas but also for commodity traders in chicago swap dealers in new york and london and pension managers in tokyo we must do so for the sakes of the tomorrow s citizens here at home and abroad in developed economies and developing ones in places that lack infrastructure or nations with growing needs like the congo or facing economic crisis like venezuela we must confidently encourage the world to continue to follow this model of free market capitalism a model that is unmatched in alleviating global poverty and unlocking human potential we welcome others to join us in a future of untethered aspiration a future where creativity and economic expression is a social good all by itself and a good for us all with the proper balance of sound policy regulatory oversight and private sector innovation new technologies and global trading will allow our markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow the economy and increase prosperity thank you again for the opportunity to talk with you this

trading ex distribution on march 11 2019 from fy19 onwards two of fibramq s four scheduled quarterly distributions will be paid in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year as fibramq s historic retained tax losses may be exhausted in 2019 fibramq is proactively modifying its distribution schedule to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable fibra regulations pursuant to which fibras must on an annual basis distribute at least 95 of their taxable income to investors by march 15 of the following year as fibramq s taxable position is highly dependent on year end fx the new distribution schedule provides two distributions following year end when our taxable position will be known allowing us to designate such distributions as return of capital which are not subject to withholding tax or distribution of taxable income which may be subject to withholding tax as may be required to comply with the distribution requirement this flexibility reduces the risk of making unnecessary tax withholdings or unscheduled distribution payments the new distribution phasing has the added benefit of reducing the maximum interval between any two quarterly distributions the new distribution

certificate for the year this guidance is driven by the following assumptions the cash generating capacity of its existing portfolio and an average exchange rate of ps 19 25 per us dollar no new acquisitions or divestments other than completion of the sale of the two remaining properties from the portfolio sale announced last summer assumes no certificate repurchases the continued stable performance of the properties in the portfolio and stable market conditions for full year 2019 fibramq expects to make cash distributions of approximately ps 1 70 per certificate to be paid in equal quarterly payments of ps 0 425 this represents an expected increase of 6 3 from the prior year while maintaining a prudent and stable affo payout ratio the payment of cash distributions is subject to the approval of the board of directors of the manager financial reporting improvements announcing affo methodology update for fy2019 fibramq recognizes the important contribution that financial reporting and transparency provides in enhancing corporate governance as part of this endeavor and following a review of global reit industry best practice measures fibramq is updating its affo reporting methodology with effect from 1 january 2019 the updated methodology continues to reflect the guiding principal of fibramq fully including within affo all actual incurred expenditures in connection with sustaining and maintaining our existing portfolio backward looking actual maintenance expenditure and related items will now be reported in affo rather than the current fy18 methodology which used a mainly forecast based approach in addition actual maintenance capex expenditure and related items will be reported on a rolling three year average allowing for continued stability of results given that the fy18 affo methodology was already substantially representative of long term maintenance capex requirements the updated methodology impact to affo is relatively small fibramq estimates that had this methodology been implemented at the beginning of 2018 the pro forma affo result for 2018 would have been negatively impacted by ps 0 03 per certificate a

overview the global capital markets are winding down what appears to be an inconclusive week quietly and on a mixed note the msci asia pacific index is poised to snap a four day advance but held on to a nearly 2 gain for the week european bourses are mostly higher and although the weekly advance of around 0 5 may not be that impressive dow jones stoxx 600 has only fallen in one of the first eight weeks of the year for a 9 5 year to date gain benchmark yields are mostly one two basis points lower with australia and italy the notable exceptions the us dollar is confined to its well worn ranges and is narrowly mixed the australian dollar has pared yesterday s losses amid efforts by officials to play down the disruption of coal exports to china sterling is a little heavier on the day but it is holding on to a 1 gain for the week a delay in both brexit and an escalation of us china tariffs looks increasingly likely asia pacific australia s treasurer and the governor of the central bank tried minimizing the significance of the disruption of coal exports to china reuters reported yesterday of the disruption and the australian dollar fell sharply the slowdown of australia s coal exports may have begun last month and rba governor lowe tried linking it to environment and profitability issues and not to the controversy over huawei it is difficult to know china uses its commercial power to express its displeasure and there is a lack of transparency this ambiguity keeps china s adversary off balance investors will be sensitive to data that shed light on these developments the reserve bank of new zealand warned that raising capital requirements for banks could all else being equal tighten financial conditions this in turn could pressure the rbnz to cut rates to offset this regulatory tightening the rbnz is proposing lifting the tier 1 capital requirement to 16 or nearly double current levels a formal decision is expected in q3 japan s underlying measures of inflation ticked up in january though the headline was was unchanged at 0 2 excluding fresh food which is how japan measures its core rate rose 0 8 up from 0 7 at the end of last year the target is 2 excluding fresh food and energy inflation rose to 0 4 from 0 3 the australian dollar had tumbled from 0 7200 yesterday to about 0 7070 despite the bearishness of the price action outside down day there has been no follow through selling the aussie is consolidating in roughly a 20 tick range on either side of 0 7100 at the middle of the range the australian dollar is off about 0 5 this week we suspect the bears to sell into additional gains that could extend to 0 7140 the dollar has risen against the yen in four sessions this week and is poised to close higher for the third consecutive week that said the range has been exceptionally narrow jpy110 40 jpy110 95 three month implied volatility has broken down and at below 6 2 it is at new five year lows today europe reports suggest that eu officials expect the uk to ask for a three month extension any longer would complicate the eu parliamentary elections at the end of may eu officials are likely to grant the extension after pressing the uk the risk of a disruptive no deal exit is scaring some policymakers and as many as 100 tory mps are threatening to vote against may s bill next week to force a delay yesterday s eu uk talks ended without a fresh agreement but the talks will continue next week there is some talk that both the uk and eu could issue parallel statements that show a more benign interpretation or expression of will that some think may be sufficient to bolster may s support germany confirmed its practically flat q4 gdp the details were interesting consumption and investment rose 0 2 and 0 9 respectively but appeared to be offset by a decline in inventories which in turn is tied to the auto sector many observers from debtor countries complain about germany s near permanent austerity but the breakdown of gdp data showed that government spending surged in q4 by 1 6 the strongest since q1 16 separately and disappointingly germany s ifo february survey showed no improvement in sentiment the sense of the current climate eased to 98 5 from 99 3 expects slipped to 93 8 from 94 3 the lowest since 2012 the overall assessment deteriorated to 103 4 from 104 5 a fresh two year low the record from the recent ecb meeting boosted expectations that a new targeted long term refinancing loan tltro will be announced next month but the modalities or details might not be announced until later in q2 the issue is not old loans are coming due this year rather after the middle of the year the previous four year loans will have a year left this puts them into a short term financing bucket and the banks are under regulatory pressure to minimize in addition if the loans are paid back the ecb s balance sheet would shrink thus far the euro has been confined to a less than a quarter cent range against the dollar it closed last week a little below 1 13 and has closed every session this week above 1 13 the three month implied vol has softened this week but around 6 3 it is a little above the month s low 6 2 which itself was the lowest since late 2012 there is a large option 1 6 bln euros struck at 1 13 that expires today the euro looks trapped in a 1 1320 1 1370 range sterling is trading at a three day low near 1 30 the intraday technicals favor it holding three month vol peaked early last december near 15 it reached a low last month near 10 and is now near 11 4 the prospects of a delay may be keeping the bears at bay but this seems to be largely discount making near term outlook difficult america president trump will reportedly meet with china s vice premier and point man in the trade talks liu he this is thought to help facilitate a meeting between trump and xi for next month a bloomberg survey found that nearly everyone polled did not expect tariffs to go up on march 1 however 18 of the 29 do expect tariffs to go up eventually there is much press coverage of the report indicating that one of the us asks is for a stable yuan we suspect this is being blown out of proportion first it is not new or even controversial the us has expressed this concern before and chinese officials say they too want a stable yuan second the g7 and g20 have endorsed letting market forces determine exchange rates many observers see a contradiction between market forces determining exchange rates and the us wants china to have a stable yuan however the contradiction is more apparent than real one gets to a stable currency not be intervening but by pursuing balanced policies third the fact that the us housing market remains nationalized or that the us recapitalized banks during the crisis does not deter us officials from pressing china to reduce the role of the state in its economy suggesting officials are not hampered cognitive dissonance after a slew of data yesterday the us economic calendar turns quiet today but headline risk is presented by at around eight fed officials speaking today investors learned this week that most officials favor ending the balance sheet operations this year though a full rationale has not been delivered on the other hand there is still a subtle tightening bias as there was no apparent discussion of the conditions that would warrant a cut but there was regarding a hike canada reports retail sales they likely declined for the second month and when autos are excluding sales probably fell for the fourth month yesterday s comments from governor poloz suggested that while the central bank s normalization is not over it is in no hurry to continue it by hiking rates the canadian dollar fell every week but one in q4 18 and is the strongest major currency this year with a 3 advance it has only fallen one week this year but this week s gain of a less than 0 25 could be under risk if the retail sales are disappointing note that there is an option for a little more than 500 mln at cad1 3215 that expires today and the greenback is hovering around it in the european morning

pursuant to which fibras must on an annual basis distribute at least 95 of their taxable income to investors by march 15 of the following year as fibramq s taxable position is highly dependent on year end fx the new distribution schedule provides two distributions following year end when our taxable position will be known allowing us to designate such distributions as return of capital which are not subject to withholding tax or distribution of taxable income which may be subject to withholding tax as may be required to comply with the distribution requirement this flexibility reduces the risk of making unnecessary tax withholdings or unscheduled distribution payments the new distribution phasing has the added benefit of reducing the maximum interval between any two quarterly

between ps 2 45 and ps 2 50 per certificate for the year this guidance is driven by the following assumptions the cash generating capacity of its existing portfolio and an average exchange rate of ps 19 25 per us dollar no new acquisitions or divestments other than completion of the sale of the two remaining properties from the portfolio sale announced last summer assumes no certificate repurchases the continued stable performance of the properties in the portfolio and stable market conditions for full year 2019 fibramq expects to make cash distributions of approximately ps 1 70 per certificate to be paid in equal quarterly payments of ps 0 425 this represents an expected increase of 6 3 from the prior year while maintaining a prudent and stable affo payout ratio the payment of cash distributions is subject to the approval of the board of directors of the manager financial reporting improvements announcing affo methodology update for fy2019 fibramq recognizes the important contribution that financial reporting and transparency provides in enhancing corporate governance as part of this endeavor and following a review of global reit industry best practice measures fibramq is updating its affo reporting methodology with effect from 1 january 2019 the updated methodology continues to reflect the guiding principal of fibramq fully including within affo all actual incurred expenditures in connection with sustaining and maintaining our existing portfolio backward looking actual maintenance expenditure and related items will now be reported in affo rather than the current fy18 methodology which used a mainly forecast based approach in addition actual maintenance capex expenditure and related items will be reported on a rolling three year average allowing for continued stability of results given that the fy18 affo methodology was already substantially representative of long term maintenance capex requirements the updated methodology impact to affo is relatively small fibramq estimates that had this methodology been implemented at the beginning of 2018 the pro forma affo result for 2018 would have been negatively impacted by ps 0 03 per certificate a

production and cost guidance as follows 2019 improved to 920 000 1 000 000 ounces from 740 000 800 000 ounces 2020 improved to 930 000 1 010 000 ounces from 850 000 910 000 ounces 2021 improved to 995 000 1 055 000 ounces from 970 000 1 005 000 ounces the revision to consolidated production guidance largely resulted from an increase in production guidance for fosterville in 2019 and 2020 to 550 000 610 000 ounces from 390 000 430 000 ounces and 500 000 540 000 ounces respectively the improvements result from changes to the mine plan to provide access to high grade swan zone stopes earlier than previously expected as well as the impact of increased average grades at the mine included in the december 31 2018 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates also contributing to the increase in consolidated production guidance was the decision to resume operations at the holloway mine which is expected to contribute approximately 20 000 ounces of production in 2019 increasing to approximately 50 000 ounces in 2021 a number of other components of the company s full year 2019 guidance were revised as a result of the increase in target production operating cash costs per ounces sold in 2019 are now targeted at 300 320 compared to 360 380 previously fosterville s operating cash costs per ounce sold guidance is revised to 170 190 from 200 220 new full year 2019 guidance for operating cash costs per ounces sold at holloway is introduced at 760 780 as a result of the restart of operations at the mine full year 2019 operating cash costs on a consolidated basis is revised to 290 300 from 270 280 to reflect the addition of close to 20 million of operating cash costs related to production at the holloway mine aisc per ounce sold guidance for full year 2019 is also improved to 520 560 compared to 630 680 in the initial guidance released on december 11 2018 the significant improvement in aisc per ounce guidance mainly reflects the increase in target production at fosterville tony makuch president and chief executive officer of kirkland lake gold commented 2018 was a year when kirkland lake gold clearly established itself as one of the most profitable companies in our industry driven by strong production growth and very low unit operating costs we also demonstrated an ability to generate substantial amounts of operating and free cash flow which resulted in a rapid buildup in our cash position very importantly we can see that the best is yet come based on recent revisions to our business plan we expect to reach around one million ounces of annual gold production starting this year with the value of each ounce increasing as unit costs show further improvement and margins increase it is important to emphasize that we remain well positioned to achieve additional growth beyond our three year outlook through the completion of the macassa 4 shaft and through other opportunities such as the potential to resume operations in the northern territory and to increase output from our holt complex we have previously talked about reaching one billion dollars of cash by the end of 2021 we now believe that at current gold prices and assuming existing business plans we could reach that milestone sooner looking at q4 2018 we achieved record quarterly revenue earnings and cash flows production for the quarter was also a record totaling 231 217 ounces which compared to the previous high of 181 155 ounces in q3 2018 and our lowest ever unit cost performance fosterville had its best quarter since the underground mine opened by a wide margin with an average grade of just under 40 grams per tonne fosterville has clearly emerged as one of the world s greatest gold mines one that we believe is not yet close to reaching its full potential also contributing to our strong fourth quarter was record production at macassa where the average grade reached over 25 grams per tonne based largely on favourable grade reconciliations we also had record production at taylor where the average grade reached 6 1 grams per tonne the highest quarterly average grade for the year looking to 2019 all of our mines are off to a good start and performing well which supports our view that kirkland lake gold is headed for another year of strong earnings cash flow and cash accumulation review of financial and operating performance the following discussion provides key summarized consolidated financial and operating information for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 results for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 include

of these non ifrs measures are included on pages 41 47 of the md a for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 revenue revenue for 2018 totaled 915 9 million an increase of 168 4 million or 23 from 747 5 million for the same period in 2017 the 168 4 million increase in revenue in 2018 was almost entirely related to a 163 4 million favourable impact from a 22 increase in gold sales to 722 277 ounces from 592 674 ounces for the same period in 2017 in addition a 2 0 per ounce or increase in the average realized gold price per ounce to 1 263 in 2018 versus 1 261 in 2017 increased revenue by 1 4 million in 2018 versus 2017 the difference in revenue after changes in volume and average realized gold price resulted from functional versus reporting currency the increase in gold sales in 2018 mainly resulted from strong sales growth at both fosterville and macassa gold sales at fosterville totaled 352 094 ounces a 36 increase from 258 315 ounces in 2017 at macassa 2018 gold sales totaled 241 278 ounces 23 higher than 196 119 ounces in 2017 the increases in gold sales at both fosterville and macassa reflected strong production growth at both mines due to significantly higher average grades for 2018 versus 2017 revenue in q4 2018 totaled 280 3 million an increase of 67 9 million or 32 from 212 4 million in q4 2017 compared to q4 2017 higher gold sales in q4 2018 increased revenue by 76 7 million with a total of 225 692 ounces sold in q4 2018 versus 165 715 ounces being sold in q4 2017 the increase in gold sales was largely attributable to fosterville where ounces sold grew by 49 to 118 955 ounces from 80 000 ounces in q4 2017 driven by record quarterly production of 124 307 ounces in q4 2018 gold sales at macassa increased 34 to 71 087 ounces from 52 865 ounces in q4 2017 while ounces sold at the taylor increased 23 to 17 777 ounces in q4 2018 gold sales at holt of 17 212 ounces in q4 2018 compared to 18 404 ounces for the same period in 2017 partially offsetting the favourable impact of higher gold sales was a 41 per ounce or 3 decline in the average realized gold price per ounce to 1 237 in q4 2018 from 1 278 in q4 2017 which reduced revenue by 9 3 million in q4 2018 compared to q4 2017 q4 2018 revenue increased 57 6 million or 26 from 222 7 million in q3 2018 a 22 increase in gold sales from 184 517 ounces in q3 2018 to 225 692 ounces in q4 2018 had a 49 6 million favourable impact on revenue compared to the previous quarter in addition a 3 increase in the average realized gold price per ounce to 1 237 from 1 204 had a 7 4 million favourable impact on q4 2018 revenue compared to q3 2018 earnings from mine operations earnings from mine operations in 2018 totaled 488 3 million a 199 2 million or 69 increase from 289 1 million in 2017 the increase reflected revenue growth of 23 as well as lower production costs and depletion and depreciation costs lower production costs in 2018 largely reflected the inclusion of 37 4 million of production costs related to the northern territory operations 2017 a 14 9 million reduction in depletion and depreciation expense resulted from the increase in mineral reserves and mineral resources included in the december 31 2017 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates royalty costs for ytd 2018 totaled 26 4 million compared to 21 4 million in 2017 with the increase reflecting higher sales volumes in 2018 earnings from mine operations in q4 2018 totaled 170 8 million an increase of 78 6 million or 85 from 92 3 million in q4 2017 and 55 5 million or 48 higher than 115 3 million the previous quarter the increase from the same period in 2017 mainly reflected the 67 9 million increase in revenue in q4 2018 versus q4 2017 production costs in q4 2018 totaled 64 6 million compared to production costs of 68 3 million in q4 2017 the year over year reduction mainly related to foreign exchange rate changes between the two periods reflecting the impact of a stronger us dollar on converting australian and canadian dollar denominated costs depletion and depreciation costs in q4 2018 totaled 37 3 million which compared to 45 6 million in q4 2017 as the impact of higher gold production was partially offset by a significant increase in the level of mineral reserves and mineral resources at the company s operations following the release of the company s december 31 2017 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates on february 20 2018 royalty expense in q4 2018 totaled 7 6 million versus 6 2 million in q4 2017 with the increase mainly reflecting higher sales volumes the growth in earnings from mine operations from the previous quarter was entirely related to the 57 6 million increase revenue on a quarter over quarter basis unit cost performance see non ifrs measures operating cash costs per ounce sold averaged 362 a 119 per ounce or 25 improvement from 2017 mainly resulting from a 24 reduction in operating cash costs per ounce sold at fosterville to 200 per ounce sold and a 19 improvement at macassa to 426 per ounce sold the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce at both fosterville and macassa are reflective of significantly higher grades in 2018 aisc per ounce sold averaged 685 127 per ounce or 16 better than the previous year with the improvement resulting from a 16 reduction in aisc per ounce sold at macassa to 713 as well as a 10 improvement at fosterville to 442 sustaining capital expenditures for 2018 totaled 174 0 million or 241 per ounce sold which compared to 147 7 million or 249 per ounce sold in 2017 higher sustaining

underground development to establish new sources of production and purchases of new mobile equipment operating cash costs per ounce sold averaged 286 in q4 2018 a 31 improvement from 412 in q4 2017

the average grade at fosterville in q4 2018 improved 85 from q4 2017 to 39 7 g t at macassa operating cash costs per ounce in q4 2018 averaged 370 a 32 improvement from 541 for the same period in 2017 with an 86 improvement in the average grade to 25 9 g t largely accounting for the lower operating cash costs per ounce compared to the previous quarter operating cash costs per ounce sold improved 19 from 351 in q3 2018 with the quarter over quarter improvement mainly reflecting the impact of higher average grades at fosterville and macassa aisc per ounce sold in q4 2018 averaged 567 compared 816 in q4 2017 in addition to the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce sold also contributing to the improvement were reduced sustaining capital expenditures which totaled 46 4 million or 206 per ounce sold in q4 2018 compared to 51 6 million or 312 per ounce sold in q4 2017 the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures in q4 2018 compared to the same period the previous year was mainly related to the weighting of sustaining capital expenditures at macassa and taylor in 2017 to the final quarter of the year q4 2018 aisc per ounce sold improved 12 from 645 the previous quarter in addition to the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce sold the reduction in aisc per ounce sold related mainly to lower levels of sustaining capital expenditures on a per ounce sold basis with q3 2018 sustaining capital expenditures totaling 41 4 million or 224 per ounce sold additional expenses corporate g a expense excluding share based payments expense and transaction costs totaled 26 3 million in 2018 versus 20 2 million in 2017 the increase compared to 2017 largely reflected higher compensation expense as well as increased audit and consulting fees for q4 2018 corporate g a expense totaled 8 0 million compared to 6 1 million in q4 2017 and 5 6 million in q3 2018 the increase from the previous quarter was mainly due to increased audit and consulting fees share based payment expense in 2018 totaled 5 2 million versus 3 9 million in 2017 the increase was reflected increased incentive compensations costs on a year over year basis share based payment expense in q4 2018

placed on care and maintenance in december 2016 and sold on december 21 2017 the increase in net earnings in 2018 compared to earnings from continuing operations in 2017 mainly reflected the impact of a 23 increase in revenue and improved unit costs compared to the previous year also contributing to the increase were lower depletion and depreciation expense due to a significant increase in the level of mineral reserves and mineral resources at the company s operations following the release of its december 31 2017 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates lower finance costs reduced care and maintenance expense and higher other income these favourable factors were only partially offset by 38 increase in exploration and evaluation expenditures excluding capitalized exploration

the company exceeded the 670 000 ounce production target for full year 2018 announced in december 2018 by 53 700 ounces or 8 the significant outperformance compared to guidance was driven by record production at fosterville of 356 230 ounces guidance of over 330 000 ounces as well as at macassa of 240 126 ounces guidance of 220 000 225 000 ounces both mines benefited from the outperformance of grades for the year and in the case of fosterville the advancement of stopes from the high grade swan zone into the 2018 mine plan the taylor mine also achieved record production totaling 58 633 ounces which exceeded the revised october 30 2018 guidance of 50 000 55 000 ounces at the holt mine production for 2018 was 67 770 ounces in line with the full year 2018 guidance of 65 000 75 000

improved target range of 230 250 with the mine s q4 2018 operating cash cost per ounce sold of 139 driving the outperformance compared to the october 30 2018 full year 2018 guidance record operating cash cost per ounce sold at fosterville in q4 2018 resulted from significantly higher than planned grades reflecting grade outperformance from both stope and development tonnes as well as the advancement of two swan zone stopes into the q4 2018 mine plan operating cash costs per ounce sold at macassa were also better than full year 2018 guidance averaging 426 with positive grade reconciliations from stopes around the 5700 foot level in q4 2018 largely accounting for the outperformance against the improved operating cash costs per ounce sold guidance of 450 470 operating cash costs per ounce sold at the holt averaged 679 which compared to full year 2018 guidance of 625 650 while operating cash costs per ounce sold at taylor mines averaged 709 respectively which compared to

extensive underground development to access and commence production from the swan zone in the lower phoenix gold system and provide access to the harrier south zone in the harrier gold system also included in sustaining capital expenditures at fosterville were additions to the mine s mobile equipment fleet and upgrades to the mill including the construction of a second gravity circuit the

the total was incurred in australia with the remaining 10 3 million being incurred at the macassa and taylor mines in canada at fosterville exploration work focused on infill and extension drilling at a number of in mine targets as well as work to evaluate district targets in close proximity to the mine encouraging infill drilling results from the swan zone were reported in july september and december with the expectation being that the results supported a significant increase in the swan zone mineral reserves as part of the december 31 2018 mineral reserve and mineral reserve estimates in addition development of an exploration drift at harrier south at fosterville commenced during q2 2018 and was completed by the end of q3 2018 drilling from the new drift began in q4 2018 in order to test the depth potential of the harrier south system where concentrations of quartz veining with high occurrences of visible gold have previously been intersected similar to those found at the lower phoenix system near the high grade swan zone in the northern territory drilling and development was conducted at the lantern deposit at the cosmo mine throughout the year development activities included driving three exploration drifts to facilitate future underground exploration drilling from the cosmo mine infrastructure ramp into the lantern deposit to support underground exploration activities also in the northern territory encouraging drill results were reported from deep drilling below and down plunge of the prospect crosscourse and lady alice open pits at union reefs as well as near the southern end of the union reefs land position in canada underground drilling at macassa continued to generate encouraging results in support of future growth in mineral resources and

at fosterville resulted from revisions to the mine plan to provide access to high grade stopes in the swan zone earlier than previously expected as well as the impact of incorporating the december 31 2018 mineral reserve into the life of mine the december 31 2018 mineral reserve estimate includes 2 720 000 ounces at an average grade of 31 0 grams per tonne with the average grade being 34 higher

000 1 055 000 ounces from 970 000 1 005 000 ounces the revision to consolidated production guidance largely resulted from an increase in production guidance for fosterville in 2019 and 2020 to 550 000 610 000 ounces from 390 000 430 000 ounces and 500 000 540 000 ounces respectively the improvements result from changes to the mine plan to provide access to high grade swan zone stopes earlier than previously expected as well as the impact of increased average grades at the mine included in the december 31 2018 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates also contributing to the increase in consolidated production guidance was the decision to resume operations at the holloway mine which is expected to contribute approximately 20 000 ounces of production in 2019 increasing to approximately 50 000 ounces in 2021 a number of other components of the company s full year 2019 guidance were revised as a result of the increase in target production operating cash costs per ounces sold in 2019 are now targeted at 300 320 compared to 360 380 previously fosterville s operating cash costs per ounce sold guidance is revised to 170 190 from 200 220 new full year 2019 guidance for operating cash costs per ounces sold at holloway is introduced at 760 780 as a result of the restart of operations at the mine full year 2019 operating cash costs on a consolidated basis is revised to 290 300 from 270 280 to reflect the addition of close to 20 million of operating cash costs related to production at the holloway mine aisc per ounce sold guidance for full year 2019 is also improved to 520 560 compared to 630 680 in the initial guidance released on december 11 2018 the significant improvement in aisc per ounce guidance mainly reflects the increase in target production at fosterville tony makuch president and chief executive officer of kirkland lake gold commented 2018 was a year when kirkland lake gold clearly established itself as one of the most profitable companies in our industry driven by strong production growth and very low unit operating costs we also demonstrated an ability to generate substantial amounts of operating and free cash flow which resulted in a rapid buildup in our cash position very importantly we can see that the best is yet come based on recent revisions to our business plan we expect to reach around one million ounces of annual gold production starting this year with the value of each ounce increasing as unit costs show further improvement and margins increase it is important to emphasize that we remain well positioned to achieve additional growth beyond our three year outlook through the completion of the macassa 4 shaft and through other opportunities such as the potential to resume operations in the northern territory and to increase output from our holt complex we have previously talked about reaching one billion dollars of cash by the end of 2021 we now believe that at current gold prices and assuming existing business plans we could reach that milestone sooner looking at q4 2018 we achieved record quarterly revenue earnings and cash flows production for the quarter was also a record totaling 231 217 ounces which compared to the previous high of 181 155 ounces in q3 2018 and our lowest ever unit cost performance fosterville had its best quarter since the underground mine opened by a wide margin with an average grade of just under 40 grams per tonne fosterville has clearly emerged as one of the world s greatest gold mines one that we believe is not yet close to reaching its full potential also contributing to our strong fourth quarter was record production at macassa where the average grade reached over 25 grams per tonne based largely on favourable grade reconciliations we also had record production at taylor where the average grade reached 6 1 grams per tonne the highest quarterly average grade for the year looking to 2019 all of our mines are off to a good start and performing well which supports our view that kirkland lake gold is headed for another year of strong earnings cash flow and cash accumulation review of financial and operating performance the following discussion provides key summarized consolidated financial and operating information for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 results for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 include

of these non ifrs measures are included on pages 41 47 of the md a for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 revenue revenue for 2018 totaled 915 9 million an increase of 168 4 million or 23 from 747 5 million for the same period in 2017 the 168 4 million increase in revenue in 2018 was almost entirely related to a 163 4 million favourable impact from a 22 increase in gold sales to 722 277 ounces from 592 674 ounces for the same period in 2017 in addition a 2 0 per ounce or increase in the average realized gold price per ounce to 1 263 in 2018 versus 1 261 in 2017 increased revenue by 1 4 million in 2018 versus 2017 the difference in revenue after changes in volume and average realized gold price resulted from functional versus reporting currency the increase in gold sales in 2018 mainly resulted from strong sales growth at both fosterville and macassa gold sales at fosterville totaled 352 094 ounces a 36 increase from 258 315 ounces in 2017 at macassa 2018 gold sales totaled 241 278 ounces 23 higher than 196 119 ounces in 2017 the increases in gold sales at both fosterville and macassa reflected strong production growth at both mines due to significantly higher average grades for 2018 versus 2017 revenue in q4 2018 totaled 280 3 million an increase of 67 9 million or 32 from 212 4 million in q4 2017 compared to q4 2017 higher gold sales in q4 2018 increased revenue by 76 7 million with a total of 225 692 ounces sold in q4 2018 versus 165 715 ounces being sold in q4 2017 the increase in gold sales was largely attributable to fosterville where ounces sold grew by 49 to 118 955 ounces from 80 000 ounces in q4 2017 driven by record quarterly production of 124 307 ounces in q4 2018 gold sales at macassa increased 34 to 71 087 ounces from 52 865 ounces in q4 2017 while ounces sold at the taylor increased 23 to 17 777 ounces in q4 2018 gold sales at holt of 17 212 ounces in q4 2018 compared to 18 404 ounces for the same period in 2017 partially offsetting the favourable impact of higher gold sales was a 41 per ounce or 3 decline in the average realized gold price per ounce to 1 237 in q4 2018 from 1 278 in q4 2017 which reduced revenue by 9 3 million in q4 2018 compared to q4 2017 q4 2018 revenue increased 57 6 million or 26 from 222 7 million in q3 2018 a 22 increase in gold sales from 184 517 ounces in q3 2018 to 225 692 ounces in q4 2018 had a 49 6 million favourable impact on revenue compared to the previous quarter in addition a 3 increase in the average realized gold price per ounce to 1 237 from 1 204 had a 7 4 million favourable impact on q4 2018 revenue compared to q3 2018 earnings from mine operations earnings from mine operations in 2018 totaled 488 3 million a 199 2 million or 69 increase from 289 1 million in 2017 the increase reflected revenue growth of 23 as well as lower production costs and depletion and depreciation costs lower production costs in 2018 largely reflected the inclusion of 37 4 million of production costs related to the northern territory operations 2017 a 14 9 million reduction in depletion and depreciation expense resulted from the increase in mineral reserves and mineral resources included in the december 31 2017 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates royalty costs for ytd 2018 totaled 26 4 million compared to 21 4 million in 2017 with the increase reflecting higher sales volumes in 2018 earnings from mine operations in q4 2018 totaled 170 8 million an increase of 78 6 million or 85 from 92 3 million in q4 2017 and 55 5 million or 48 higher than 115 3 million the previous quarter the increase from the same period in 2017 mainly reflected the 67 9 million increase in revenue in q4 2018 versus q4 2017 production costs in q4 2018 totaled 64 6 million compared to production costs of 68 3 million in q4 2017 the year over year reduction mainly related to foreign exchange rate changes between the two periods reflecting the impact of a stronger us dollar on converting australian and canadian dollar denominated costs depletion and depreciation costs in q4 2018 totaled 37 3 million which compared to 45 6 million in q4 2017 as the impact of higher gold production was partially offset by a significant increase in the level of mineral reserves and mineral resources at the company s operations following the release of the company s december 31 2017 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates on february 20 2018 royalty expense in q4 2018 totaled 7 6 million versus 6 2 million in q4 2017 with the increase mainly reflecting higher sales volumes the growth in earnings from mine operations from the previous quarter was entirely related to the 57 6 million increase revenue on a quarter over quarter basis unit cost performance see non ifrs measures operating cash costs per ounce sold averaged 362 a 119 per ounce or 25 improvement from 2017 mainly resulting from a 24 reduction in operating cash costs per ounce sold at fosterville to 200 per ounce sold and a 19 improvement at macassa to 426 per ounce sold the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce at both fosterville and macassa are reflective of significantly higher grades in 2018 aisc per ounce sold averaged 685 127 per ounce or 16 better than the previous year with the improvement resulting from a 16 reduction in aisc per ounce sold at macassa to 713 as well as a 10 improvement at fosterville to 442 sustaining capital expenditures for 2018 totaled 174 0 million or 241 per ounce sold which compared to 147 7 million or 249 per ounce sold in 2017 higher sustaining

underground development to establish new sources of production and purchases of new mobile equipment operating cash costs per ounce sold averaged 286 in q4 2018 a 31 improvement from 412 in q4 2017

the average grade at fosterville in q4 2018 improved 85 from q4 2017 to 39 7 g t at macassa operating cash costs per ounce in q4 2018 averaged 370 a 32 improvement from 541 for the same period in 2017 with an 86 improvement in the average grade to 25 9 g t largely accounting for the lower operating cash costs per ounce compared to the previous quarter operating cash costs per ounce sold improved 19 from 351 in q3 2018 with the quarter over quarter improvement mainly reflecting the impact of higher average grades at fosterville and macassa aisc per ounce sold in q4 2018 averaged 567 compared 816 in q4 2017 in addition to the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce sold also contributing to the improvement were reduced sustaining capital expenditures which totaled 46 4 million or 206 per ounce sold in q4 2018 compared to 51 6 million or 312 per ounce sold in q4 2017 the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures in q4 2018 compared to the same period the previous year was mainly related to the weighting of sustaining capital expenditures at macassa and taylor in 2017 to the final quarter of the year q4 2018 aisc per ounce sold improved 12 from 645 the previous quarter in addition to the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce sold the reduction in aisc per ounce sold related mainly to lower levels of sustaining capital expenditures on a per ounce sold basis with q3 2018 sustaining capital expenditures totaling 41 4 million or 224 per ounce sold additional expenses corporate g a expense excluding share based payments expense and transaction costs totaled 26 3 million in 2018 versus 20 2 million in 2017 the increase compared to 2017 largely reflected higher compensation expense as well as increased audit and consulting fees for q4 2018 corporate g a expense totaled 8 0 million compared to 6 1 million in q4 2017 and 5 6 million in q3 2018 the increase from the previous quarter was mainly due to increased audit and consulting fees share based payment expense in 2018 totaled 5 2 million versus 3 9 million in 2017 the increase was reflected increased incentive compensations costs on a year over year basis share based payment expense in q4 2018

in 2018 totaled 5 1 million which compared to other income of 3 4 million in 2017 other income in 2018 mainly reflected an unrealized and realized foreign exchange gain of 16 9 million which was only partially offset by a 10 9 million marked to market loss on fair valuing the company s common share purchase warrants the unrealized and realized foreign exchange gain in 2018 resulted from the australian and canadian dollars weakening against the us dollar during the year the main contributors to other income in 2017 were recognition of a deferred premium on flow through shares totaling 3 1

the company exceeded the 670 000 ounce production target for full year 2018 announced in december 2018 by 53 700 ounces or 8 the significant outperformance compared to guidance was driven by record production at fosterville of 356 230 ounces guidance of over 330 000 ounces as well as at macassa of 240 126 ounces guidance of 220 000 225 000 ounces both mines benefited from the outperformance of grades for the year and in the case of fosterville the advancement of stopes from the high grade swan zone into the 2018 mine plan the taylor mine also achieved record production totaling 58 633 ounces which exceeded the revised october 30 2018 guidance of 50 000 55 000 ounces at the holt mine production for 2018 was 67 770 ounces in line with the full year 2018 guidance of 65 000 75 000

improved target range of 230 250 with the mine s q4 2018 operating cash cost per ounce sold of 139 driving the outperformance compared to the october 30 2018 full year 2018 guidance record operating cash cost per ounce sold at fosterville in q4 2018 resulted from significantly higher than planned grades reflecting grade outperformance from both stope and development tonnes as well as the advancement of two swan zone stopes into the q4 2018 mine plan operating cash costs per ounce sold at macassa were also better than full year 2018 guidance averaging 426 with positive grade reconciliations from stopes around the 5700 foot level in q4 2018 largely accounting for the outperformance against the improved operating cash costs per ounce sold guidance of 450 470 operating cash costs per ounce sold at the holt averaged 679 which compared to full year 2018 guidance of 625 650 while operating cash costs per ounce sold at taylor mines averaged 709 respectively which compared to october 30 2018 full year 2018 guidance of 750 775 aisc per ounce sold of 685 for 2018 was better than the company s improved october 30 2018 full year 2018 guidance of 735 760 the significant outperformance compared to the full year 2018 guidance was primarily volume driven with both production and sales levels well above expected levels for the year aisc per ounce sold at fosterville for 2018 averaged 442 while aisc per ounce sold at macassa averaged 713 royalty costs totaled 26 4 million for 2018 in line with full year 2018 guidance of 22 27 million sustaining capital expenditures for 2018 totaled 174 0 million which compared to full year 2018 guidance of 150 170 million fosterville accounted for the largest component of sustaining capital expenditures in 2018 sustaining capital expenditures at fosterville were in line with expected levels and reflected a number of planned investments intended to support multiple years of production included in the investments was extensive underground development to access and commence production from the swan zone in the lower phoenix gold system and provide access to the harrier south zone in the harrier gold system also included in sustaining capital expenditures at fosterville were additions to the mine s mobile equipment fleet and upgrades to the mill including the construction of a second gravity circuit the remaining sustaining capital expenditures for full year 2018 included 59 9 million at macassa 21 7 million at holt and 16 3 million at taylor growth capital expenditures for 2018 totaled 103 8 million excluding capitalized exploration expenditures which compared to revised full year 2018 guidance of 110 115 million growth capital expenditures at macassa in 2018 totaled 68 3 million of which 46 1

totaled 23 3 million with expenditures mainly focused on three main projects a new ventilation system paste fill plant and water treatment plan the northern territory accounted for 8 3 million of growth capital expenditures while taylor accounting for most of the remainder of growth capital expenditures exploration expenditures totaled 97 9 million for 2018 compared to guidance of 90 million included in exploration expenditures were 66 6 million of expensed exploration expenditures and 31 3 million of capitalized exploration expenditures of exploration expenditures 87 6 million or 89 of the total was incurred in australia with the remaining 10 3 million being incurred at the macassa and taylor mines in canada at fosterville exploration work focused on infill and extension drilling at a number of in mine targets as well as work to evaluate district targets in close proximity to the mine encouraging infill drilling results from the swan zone were reported in july september and december with the expectation being that the results supported a significant increase in the swan zone mineral reserves as part of the december 31 2018 mineral reserve and mineral reserve estimates in addition development of an exploration drift at harrier south at fosterville commenced during q2 2018 and was completed by the end of q3 2018 drilling from the new drift began in q4 2018 in order to test the depth potential of the harrier south system where concentrations of quartz veining with high occurrences of visible gold have previously been intersected similar to those found at the lower phoenix system near the high grade swan zone in the northern territory drilling and development was conducted at the lantern deposit at the cosmo mine throughout the year development activities included driving three exploration drifts to facilitate future underground exploration drilling from the cosmo mine infrastructure ramp into the lantern deposit to support underground exploration activities also in the northern territory encouraging drill results were reported from deep drilling below and down plunge of the prospect crosscourse and lady alice open pits at union reefs as well as near the southern end of the union reefs land position in canada underground drilling at macassa continued to generate encouraging results in support of future growth in mineral resources and mineral reserves while drilling at taylor continued to target additional expansion of mineralization around the shaft and west porphyry deposits corporate g a expense totaled 26 3 million for ytd 2018

below are excerpts from a cnbc interview with the president of greece s new democracy party and the country s leader of the opposition kyriakos mitsotakis and cnbc s silvia amaro q1 if you look at the latest opinion polls it seems that you re well placed to become the next prime minister if indeed that s the case what are going to be your priorities a1 the next election is going to be about the economy about jobs and about disposable income so my number one priority is to restore the greek economy to an aggressive growth path if you look at what happened over the past 10 years greek people have suffered a lot they ve suffered as a result of failed policies of the previous governments they ve also suffered as a result of the fact that the current government put us in an unnecessary position of requesting a third bailout programme back in august 2015 which has essentially prolonged the crisis for way too long and i think it s about time to send a very clear signal to the greek population and also to the international markets that we are committed to an aggressive reform programme that we want to unleash the forces of entrepreneurship in greece we want to support private investment while at the same time obtaining social cohesion this is my number one priority and this is a platform that i will present to the greek people in the upcoming election q2 i ll go back to some of the points you ve just raised but if we look at what happened in 2015 what the current government would argue is that it wasn t really up to the current government to actually ask for a third bailout program in the meantime they have changed for instance the finance minister a2 look we all know what happened during the first six months of 2015 it was very very painful for the country this government brought down the previous government and they promised that it would tear up the programmes and would end austerity the end result was an unnecessary confrontation with our creditors a completely unnecessary referendum a spectacular u turn back in july 2015 and the third programme which according to estimates by the european institutions cost us in excess of 100 billion euros greece should have exited the bailout programs in 2015 we re in 2019 we have technically exited the third bailout program but full market access has not been restored so we re still in a crisis and we are looking for the right government and the right policies to put an end to this ten year crisis q3 what would you have done different in 2015 if you were in tsipras role a3 the first thing that any reasonable prime minister would have done he would not have appointed mr varoufakis as minister of finance certainly would not have over promised that he would rip apart the memorandum and certainly would not have engaged in a populist bonanza which is exactly what mr tsipras did back in 2014 where he essentially deceived the greek people and got elected by promising things he couldn t never deliver not only that he did the exact opposite when he was forced by the circumstances to make a spectacular u turn if you look at the policies that were implemented over the past four years post 2015 these are not really growth oriented policies you have a government that is systematically overtaxing the middle class only to create larger primary surpluses that aren t actually necessary to return part of those primary surpluses in the form of handouts to specific electoral groups that mr tsipras is interested in that is not a sustainable strategy to grow the economy and i think greece overall has paid the price we are the only country that entered the bailout programme that actually requested three bailout programmes and that is still not able to borrow from the international capital markets at reasonable interest rates q4 let s go back to your programme for instance if you become prime minister what is the number one measure that you will seek to implement and how soon will you put it forward a4 an aggressive and comprehensive tax reform q5 as soon as you enter government a5 this is something we can deliver within the first month we will also be sending a very clear signal to the capital markets that we mean business i have committed myself to be able to take greece back to investment grade within 18 months so we will be very systematic and very focused in delivering the changes that the country actually needs we need to start reducing marginal tax rates within the scope of the fiscal targets that have currently been addressed i will return to this this question in a bit but everybody recognizes that the real economy today is overtaxed so in a fiscally neutral way we need to start lowering tax rates but we also need to use our tax policy as an incentive to attract investment so we re looking at a more favorable treatment for capital investment in the country we re looking at a more favorable treatment for r d investment we re looking to make greece an attractive destination for people who want to invest in greek real estate i have big belief in the greek real estate market we live in a lovely country and we need to make investing in greek real estate more attractive so number one priority would be a comprehensive tax reform which we could put in place very very quickly we ve practically done all of the ground work and our number two priority would be a broad intervention in terms of improving the business climate and making doing business in greece overall easier and more attractive to foreign but also to domestic investors q6 looking at the opinion polls even though we are in a good place to become the next prime minister it seems that you might not get a parliamentary majority does that worry you and how can you overcome that a6 first of all i look at the opinion polls with interest i do not consider any election to be a foregone conclusion 2019 is going to be an electoral year we have national elections we have european elections we have regional elections we have municipal elections a very important year for greece and i think a year where we will have a big political change but we know we have to work very hard not only to convince people that mr tsipras has done a poor job people know that what we need to do is to convince more people that we are actually able to make their lives better and i think we have the policy programme in place we need to articulate it in an even more convincing manner and i believe that we will create a broader momentum for a big electoral victory what i have said is that even if i win with an absolute majority i will seek to build a broader political coalition the day after a simple reason being that we need to make important changes the day after and the bigger the political coalition to support these changes the better it s going to be for us for the country but i think there is a broader trend in greek society that is supportive of our policy proposals but also of our ideas and of ideology there s a broader trend in greece away from this concept of a big state of a clientelistic state that will always be able to accommodate people by hiring them with the public administration there s a greater belief in the value of entrepreneurship there s a greater belief in the value of companies that behave responsibly towards their employees towards the environment all these are sort of core pillars of our of our political program so i think what we proposed to the greek society is very much in line with what greek society wants to hear after 10 years of crisis what they certainly do not want to hear is another extravaganza of fake promises that we will not be able to deliver the day after i made it very very clear from the day i was elected leader that i have the idea that i want to break with a sort of a populist tradition of greek politics we are making commitments that we can actually deliver the day after and i think that the greek society is mature enough to appreciate that q7 let s talk about the budget primary surplus greece has actually overshot its targets from the budget surplus isn t this sending a positive message a7 well i think it s sending the wrong message in the sense that we have gone overboard with austerity the reason why we have overshot the targets was because the government over taxed the middle class and the reason why the government wanted to create a bigger surplus than was actually requested was because we wanted to use this primary surplus to distribute it in the form of electoral handouts this is the wrong policy we should stick to our targets and if there is fiscal space we should reduce taxes it s a simple as simple as that by the way reducing taxes is also going to improve tax compliance in an economy that has sort of a tendency to move towards tax evasion now mr tsipras has agreed to primary surpluses of 3 5 until 2022 i think this is a very very strict very strict target i ve said from the beginning that i respect the agreements made by the current government but i ve also told my european partners that should we be able to deliver real reforms we should be rewarded with smaller primary surpluses at least in 2021 and 2022 2020 you know what the budget is too close to probably be able to make change for 2020 but what i ask is very specific give me 12 months to convince our creditors the international capital markets that we actually mean business that greece can actually change and we take full ownership of the reform agenda that we don t just the reforms because they are in a programme and somebody is telling us to do them because we actually believe in the reforms that we have proposed they will promote growth but they re also socially responsible so should this happen let s have a discussion again 12 months later to renegotiate the primary surpluses q8 after your first year in office you will want to renegotiate the 3 5 target a8 i will in good faith i will talk to my european creditors q9 how do you intend to approach those discussions a9 in good faith and always in a very cooperative spirit this is not about confrontation and at the end of the day whether we have a primary surplus let s say in 2021 of 3 or 2 5 it s not going to make a big difference in terms of our overall debt sustainability but symbolically it would be a reward for a country that is actually engaging in meaningful reforms also i have committed myself that whatever fiscal space i can negotiate 80 percent of it is going to be redirected into tax cuts because the danger was always that if you give greece fiscal space they will start doing the things that they did in the past they will sort of engage into the traditional sort of patronage politics i m not that type of politician and i think i have enough credibility to convince both our creditors and the international capital markets that i mean business when i talk about reforms however additional fiscal space that could be used for cutting taxes on corporations but also social security is going to fuel the growth and at the end of the day what greece needs is not a growth of 2 percent that s not going to make a difference we need a growth of at least in the short term of 4 percent that will be the target that we should really really set and our creditors should be happy the more the economy grows the greater the chances that greece will fully repay its debts so this is at the end of day a question about growth if the economy is trapped in a low growth environment than the constant question of whether we can repay our debts is going to systematically resurface if greece growth grows aggressively then our debt suddenly becomes much more sustainable q10 so what s the biggest threat to economic recovery and economic growth in greece a10 i think the opportunities are clearly there this is a country that is in doubt with significant natural competitive advantages beautiful country safe and stable country in an important geopolitical neighborhood with a highly skilled and committed labour force with asset prices being very cheap after 10 years of crisis this country can generate significant a significant investment boom in various sectors tourism renewable energy high quality agriculture services logistics you know shipping greece should really be a shipping hub for the world it really should be a shipping hub for the entire world not just for europe so i think we can we can really describe a convincing growth story for the country of course there are risks that always we ve we cannot control but i would say that for us the biggest risk is an implementation risk assuming we receive a strong mandate we then have to deliver on a very bold and i think carefully planned reform programme on various fronts we need to break the vicious cycle we haven t broken it yet you know some people can argue that yes some progress might have been made over the past years but compare it to what base yes if you compare it to the disaster of 2015 where we almost exited the eurozone of course we re in a better place but are we in a good enough place to compare greece to portugal for example your home country look at what happened in portugal look at how well portugal has done under a socialist government post 2015 and compare the portuguese story or the cyprus story to the greek story this is very very disappointing what has happened in greece and we don t deserve this we deserve much better q11 we did see the first bond sale post bailout happening last month the growth rate is picking up unemployment is coming down it might not be at the rate you want but these things are happening so should the current government get some credit a11 well first of all let s take the points you raise one at a time recent bond sale yes but look at the comparative cost to portugal or ireland or cyrprus full market access has not been achieved and it s still way too expensive for market access has not been restored and this is a problem for the country q12 but the bond sales we ve seen interest from funds rather than hedge funds a12 that s good and we re interested in in making the case for long term investors i would argue that as we get closer to an election the market is also going to begin to price in a likely political change if the markets believe that there will be a political change if the markets believe the story that we re telling them it is very very likely that things between now and the elections could get better and this is good for the country i never was someone to undermine my country to gain political any sort of political advantage i remember mr tsipras back in 2014 discouraging investors from investing in greece i never told them that and i will always say you invest in greece invest in the country if you want to do it now in anticipation of a political change obviously you re welcome to do it you may even be ahead of the curve so i would argue that if the markets react positively over the next months that s good it s a welcome development it could also have something to do with the fact that people may anticipate a political change and we may find ourselves as greece a rather favorable situation let me explain at a time when we talk a lot about populists and the rest of europe and the threats of political instability you may find yourself in greece with a centre right moderate reform oriented government with a strong political mandate that would mean that there is no political risk where at least the risk of political uncertainty is taken out of the equation i think this is important for international investors as they scan the entire euro area so no i would not give the government much credit for what has happened i would say way too little way too late q13 one of your aims is to reform corporate tax you mentioned that earlier could you give us some detail on your plan a13 we want to take corporate taxation down from 28 percent where it is now tsipras promised to take it from 29 to 26 percent he s taken it down to 28 percent we want to take it down to 20 percent within two years i think it s an important signal that we want to send to the business community if you invest in greece you will have a more favourable treatment this is what is what is doable given our fiscal constraints and we also want to reduce taxes and dividends from 15 to 5 percent something which is very important also for small medium businesses where the shareholders the owners managers are frequently rewarded through dividends but it s not just about that as i told you we want a forward looking tax policy that will encourage capital investment in greece we want more investment incentives for green investments in greece want to give incentives to homeowners to retrofit their houses make them more environmentally more energy efficient a lot of this is already happening as more people rent their houses through sharing platforms but we really need to turbocharge this effort and of course we need to be very diligent when it comes to compliance one of the good things that has happened as a result of the reforms that were implemented over the past years was that finally we have an independent revenue agency which has sufficient data for the first time to really go after the serial tax evaders and what we ve said is very very clear we re offering people in businesses a fair deal to lower your taxes but we re going to be ruthless in terms of punishing you if you don t pay the lower tax rates and i think this is a reasonable proposal and every time in the past we lowered tax rates we were pleasantly surprised by how tax compliance improved we did it with vat on food and beverage back in 2014 and we actually saw that there was a very small revenue shortfall as a reason to do it again now because if you go down to a greek taverna it will be very difficult to convince a different owner to actually issue you a receipt and you may benefit as a customer but the state is losing q14 the international community is very excited about some of your reforms but having spoken with some greek citizens some have told me that they feel you come from a very privileged family and sometimes they also mention that you are a little bit distant from the reality how are you going to convince those ordinary greek citizens a14 i have the privilege of coming from a political family and one could argue that i do come from a privileged background i mean this is who i am and i m not going to change that but i worked very hard to get to where i am you know my studies my professional career but also my career in politics i worked hard to get to where i am today and i may come from a political family but i think a lot of people know me by my first name and recognize that i have will judge me for who i am i don t think in at a time when we talk a lot about you know elites versus the people it s very simple to say oh you know these elites don t understand what the real people are feeling i really don t think that is the case i think in the proposals that we ve made we really care about social cohesion we really care about not just the owners of businesses but also business people but also the work of the employees of the businesses that s why i ve encouraged people and i want to use more more tax incentives especially for big corporates to provide better packages to their employees and i d be very very open to tax incentives for companies to actually handle shares to their employees because i do believe in this new form of sort of i would hesitate to call it collective ownership but the format that you see in a lot of startups where the employees are actually also owners of the businesses is a form that works actually quite well and i m here to make people s lives better and you need to start with those who are less privileged i deeply care about that at the end of the day i know there are always going to be people who may think that my privileged background is a barrier you know i ll try to convince them i ll do my best and hopefully i ll convince them after the election should i win i know there are people who are not going to vote for me in this election because they are still hesitant about my intentions about our party s intentions our party has changed a lot over the past years i hope i ll be able to convince them to vote for me in the election after the next election when i will actually have delivered i said i said look there s a little cynicism in politics today everywhere it s not just in greece the only thing i can do is to be myself and you know let people decide that s the beauty of democracy not everyone is going to vote for you q15 i have just one final question european elections i was wondering if you are supporting the spitzenkandidat process a15 i am i am a vocal advocate who supporting the spitzenkandidat process it was put in place in 2014 there s every reason why we should stick to it i think it is important for people to understand that if they vote for example for new democrat they will be voting for the european people s party and that should the european people s party be the largest party in the european parliament as it will manfred weber should be our next president of the commission so very very clear that the spitzenkandidat process adds a degree of accountability and somehow bridges the gap between you know the brussels elites and the people of europe going back would be would be significant backtracking i mean this should not be just a question about you know back door negotiations in the council we tell people very clearly that for example if they vote for new democracy in the elections they would also indirectly be voting for who the next president of the commission is i feel very comfortable with our choice on manfred weber he s a great guy he is a good friend i think would be an excellent president of the of the commission and i fully support the spritzenkandidat process q16 what do you think if other european leaders for instance french president macron block the process a16 it s the process for picking the next president of the commission is very clearly laid out division of labour within the council and the european parliament what i can tell you that i have supported the spitzenkandidat process and if i should i be elected prime minister and i have the privilege of participating in the council i will support the spitzenkandidat process ends about cnbc cnbc is the leading global broadcaster of live business and financial news and information reporting directly from the major financial markets

percent and 18 percent respectively compared to the same periods of 2017 these increases were caused by new volumes arising from a full year of operations from veresen midstream s sunrise tower and

production in the resource basins where pembina operates and complex and higher volumes at the majority of the other facilities as customers continued to increase production in the resource basins where operates and marketing new ventures division increased marketed ngl sales volumes by two percent to 201 mboe d in the fourth quarter over the comparable period in 2017 and generated quarterly operating margin of 121 million a 27 percent decrease over the comparable period in 2017 the decrease in operating margin in the fourth quarter was due to the lower margins on commodity sales as a result of lower crude oil and ngl market prices compared to the same period in 2017 combined with increased market based intercompany fees offset by the swing to a realized gain on commodity related derivative financial instruments compared to the realized loss in the same period of 2017 on a full year basis operating margin was 468 million in 2018 compared to 369 million in 2017 this increase was the result of the full year contribution from the equity accounted investment in aux sable executive overview 2018 was truly remarkable for pembina we strengthened our financial and operational performance driven by our diverse and strategically located assets strong customer contracts and the dedication and creativity of our customers and employees over this past year we continued to secure new business pursued growth projects operated safely and reliably and further enhanced our already strong relationships with the communities where we live work and play in 2018 we announced the next evolution in pembina s corporate strategy the move towards accessing global markets pembina is committed to identifying additional opportunities to connect hydrocarbon production to new demand locations through the development of infrastructure that would extend our service offering further along the hydrocarbon value chain these new developments will contribute to ensuring that hydrocarbons produced in the western canadian sedimentary basin and the other basins where pembina operates can reach the highest value markets throughout the world our recently approved pdh pp facility the prince rupert lpg export terminal currently under construction and our proposed jordan cove lng project are examples of such developments the most notable financial achievement over the past year was exceeding the high end of our original 2018 guidance range with adjusted ebitda of 2 835 million seven percent higher than the mid point of the original range contributing to this record breaking adjusted ebitda was the full year contribution from the greater than 10 billion increase in assets from the veresen acquisition and new assets placed into service following the execution of our large scale capital program completed in 2017 the veresen acquisition was transformational for pembina and we are pleased with how well the integration of staff and systems went bringing together two large and different organizations comes with a wide range of risks and yet through the diligent management of our integration team we are realizing the strategic and financial benefits of the combination along with record adjusted ebitda our 2018 adjusted cash flow from operating activities per common share of 4 27 also was an all time high notably when comparing where we are now to where we were ten years ago we have grown volumes by 180 percent cash flow per share by 171 percent and the dividend by 50 percent over the same 10 year period shareholders have realized a total return of about 380 percent or 17 percent per year assuming reinvestment of their dividends our steady and growing dividend is one of the strongest ways we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to shareholders we have always worked hard to ensure our ability to pay a competitive dividend and the 5 6 percent dividend increase in 2018 represents our seventh consecutive annual increase since our inception pembina has returned over 6 9 billion to our shareholders and the dividend has never been reduced ensuring pembina continues to deliver a sustainable and growing dividend to shareholders remains a top priority continuing our dividend track record while growing the business requires a strong commitment to prudent financial management something that has always been fundamental to pembina as the company has grown we have also improved the risk profile of the business and strengthened our financial guardrails we have increased the percentage of our adjusted ebitda that comes from fee based business and our dividend is fully supported by these fee based cash flows meaning pembina is not reliant on the commodity exposed part of our business to fund the dividend in addition pembina has a very strong balance sheet low payout ratio and expects to fund our near term capital program without the need for external equity in 2018 we placed approximately 900 million of projects into service including the phase iv and v expansions of the peace pipeline system veresen midstream s north central liquids hub and saturn ii gas plant cavern developments as well as several other value added capital projects we also secured over 1 8 billion of new capital projects including the phase vi and vii peace pipeline expansions hythe developments and duvernay iii consistent with pembina s guardrails these projects are underpinned by long term fee based contracts that will generate incremental secure and predictable cash flow to support the stability and growth of the dividend with new projects placed into service in 2018 we announced an adjusted ebitda guidance range of 2 8 to 3 0 billion and a 1 6 billion capital program for 2019 we are entering the new year with positive momentum and already in 2019 pembina has secured the 500 million phase viii peace pipeline expansion and through our joint venture canada kuwait petrochemical corporation approved development of a 4 5 billion 2 5 billion net to pembina integrated pdh pp facility the prospects for future growth both within the base business and further extensions of our value chain remain robust we are as rich in growth opportunities as we have ever been which is a testament to both the resiliency and creativity of our customers and the underlying attractiveness of the western canadian sedimentary basin we look forward to the year ahead and are optimistic confident and excited to continue building something extraordinary new developments and growth projects update pipelines division pembina s phase iv and

west chief executive officer and director thank you brad and welcome everyone our messages today will focus on the following key themes first we had a very good performance in north america this past quarter driven by a 6 same store withdrawals record system availability and solid new sales execution second we delivered on our key business priorities this past year in business momentum and confidence building this year we expect to move past the negative headwinds the ones that we are all way too familiar with during the first half of the year we then expect to have attractive top line and bottom line performance in the second half of the year which will set a great jump off point for the following year and established a trend for the medium term business outlook let me start today by reminding you of our 2018 priorities first drive durable organic revenue growth second deliver operational excellence and portfolio optimization third creating raving fans with our customers fourth engender employee pride and finally deliver growth and free cash flow and pay down debt now looking back on the year where we were about this time a year ago i m very pleased with the team s execution and progress so starting with the top line we return to organic growth in north america importantly we demonstrated the power of our unmatched retail based atm network and the value of allpoint our us same store withdrawals were up 6 for the full year certainly there were some tailwinds in the early part of the year related to the comps and recapture from 7 eleven but we largely cycled on those impacts in q3 and then exited the year on solid ground the same store transaction levels drove atm operating revenue growth in north america a 5 for the full year up from a negative 2 in 2017 when you exclude 7 eleven we also saw terrific performance and double digit growth in south africa germany and spain on the operational excellence front we achieved record availability in the us and the united kingdom which in turn drove improved revenues and lower costs we are now operating at availability levels that most banks and retailers cannot cost effectively match on their own we also reduced operating costs in several areas enabling investment in growth initiatives and additional security measures now let me turn quickly touch on something that i have not spoken about at length on these calls before engendering employee pride i know it s an intangible one that s hard to measure but this is an area that our management team is also focused on and i believe talent is crucial to the long term success of this business we have made progress on our culture systems and office environments change is in the air we ve got a strong purpose driven mission and we re building for the long term our team is truly making a difference day in and day out which is showing up on our bottom line and regarding our bottom line for the full year in 2018 we generated 118 million in adjusted free cash flow up nearly 60 from 2017 which was used to pay down debt in the context of losing 75 million in ebitda from the loss of 7 eleven the significant growth in free cash flow was a notable achievement for the year this growth in free cash flow is a result of organic growth in the us driven by surcharge free transactions to our existing well recognized and convenient retailer based network essentially more transactions at our installed network driving higher roi that factor is combined with overall disciplined operating performance and capital cost management moving specifically to the fourth quarter atm operating revenues in north america were up 4 excluding 7 eleven and on a constant currency basis this growth was driven by strong same store transactions of 6 led by double digit growth and surcharge free transactions from the allpoint and bank branding products in the us our transaction driving initiatives with financial institutions and retailers are working additionally we continue to add new partners to allpoint enabling 21 new financial institutions to our network in the fourth quarter bringing with them over 1 million additional cardholders new allpoint members include rbc bank in the us qapital an innovative and fast growing consumer non traditional financial services provider and visa enrolling their prepaid and debit card holders traveling to the us from various south asian countries we also had success with bank branding adding new relationships to brand over 400 new units in coming periods we completed a fi commercial tripled in the fourth quarter by adding several key atm managed service contracts with security service federal credit union one of the top 10 largest credit unions in the us central valley community bank and others in total adding nearly 200 new atms under managed service contracts these atms are located at branches and off premise locations moving to the retail side we added several new wins and expansions including the new placement contract with a leading operator of convenience stores located at airports and travel destinations adding high transacting atms with potential to add more locations over time we ended the year on solid footing in north america we experienced improving commercial performance at a new allpoint bank branding and fi managed service relationships in addition to the new retail locations this is combined with the great operational performance and same store transaction growth let me transition over to europe and africa segment on a constant currency basis revenue was down 3 for the quarter similar to the previous quarter the largest component of this segment the uk was down driven by the negative change in the link interchange rate in addition to the removal of underperforming atms over the past year these factors combined with the same store declines of 2 caused revenues to be down about 7 in the uk in the quarter our fast growing germany spain and south africa businesses grew at double digit rates as we continue to grow nicely in these markets we added great retail and touristic locations and layered in bank branding and managed services arrangements we continue to take action in the uk to manage through the headwinds as a reminder we were impacted by the second link interchange rate reduction on january 1st of this year we expect this will be the last rate reduction in the near future this is causing many changes in the marketplace we removed over 3 000 atms and transitioned about 500 units to pay to use from free to use in 2019 we are in the process of moving up to an additional 3 500 atms to pay to use it is a shame that link has caused such disruption in the marketplace when free to use interchange rates in the uk were already one of the lowest in the world these changes we are making will mitigate some but not all of the impact from this pricing change that said even with these uk headwinds we see a path where the growth countries of germany spain and south africa will largely offset the current negative impact to revenues in the uk this year we believe there are opportunities for growth in the uk once the market stabilizes and we ll talk further about this at the upcoming investor day in australia our revenues were down 8 on a constant currency basis for the quarter which while down was our best reported quarter this year we have now just about fully cycled on the bank s removal of the direct charge in the fall of 2017 market dynamics looked to be headed in the right direction for us as banks continue to close branches and remove atms the bank atms are now more expensive for them as to operate due to the removal due to the removal of the revenue over time this dynamic should be a positive one for us we generated an attractive amount of free cash flow this past year paid down debt and we now have our sights on reaching our targeted leverage level this year we expect to increase our investments in new product in the united states fund growth and infrastructure and still generate a significant amount of free cash flow after making investments in the business with an attractive roi and as we achieve our targeted leverage levels we expect that our capital allocation plans will evolve toward returning excess cash flow to shareholders we plan to share more with you about our plans for growth and capital allocation at the investor day next month now on that last point let me wrap up my comments today with a window into our upcoming investor day we look forward to providing more insight into our business and management team on march 27 at the nasdaq in new york we will share our vision our growth strategy our execution plans financial targets and capital allocation each of our regions have different profile so we will provide market and business insights across our geographies we see growth opportunities in all of our markets but believe the us business represents the single largest area of value creation as we leverage our network based business with retailers and fis of all sizes and build on our managed services platform we have the right solutions scale and technical capabilities to enable fis to refocus their resources toward other digital priorities and allow us to serve their customers cash needs it is our vision and goal to manage their cash transactions on our convenient low cost network this is a substantial opportunity and cardtronics is best positioned to capitalize on this evolving secular shift in the market there are many good things happening across the business and we are excited to share our enthusiasm with you next month and with that let me turn the call over to gary gary w ferrera chief financial officer thank you ed we entered 2018 focused internally on some key objectives such as getting back to organic growth operational excellence and focusing on delivering cash flows and repaying debt we communicated in our outlook for performance based on our view of the market at that time especially considering market disruptions in the uk and australia and the loss of our largest partner in us 7 eleven talking to you year later i believe that we ve delivered on these objectives and throughout the year we were able to raise our outlook several times as we executed on our priorities and had better than expected conditions in some of our markets such as australia with that let me jump into the q4 results consolidated revenues were 328 million for the quarter adjusting the prior year to exclude 7 eleven this result was approximately flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis fortunately this is the last time we will need to report our year over year results excluding 7 eleven as a reminder 7 eleven s impact in 2018 was limited to approximately 6 million in revenues and no ebitda in the first quarter excluding the 7 eleven impact the revenue growth rate in our north american segment was 4 for the quarter this growth rate was once again driven by strong same store transactions in the us which were up a 6 ph a noteworthy noteworthy in the fourth quarter was our same store surcharge transactions which were basically flat a solid indicator that while consumer payment options continue to evolve and be adopted cash remains an important tool for consumers and they like and trust our convenient and safe atms when there is a fee the solid top line growth in our north america segment was offset by declines in our europe and africa and australia segments our europe and africa segment was down 3 in constant currency for the quarter primarily due to the uk link interchange rate decline that came into effect in july of 2018 and same store transactions which were down approximately 2 for the quarter our germany spain and south africa businesses continue to perform nicely and are up double digits for the quarter on the top line offsetting a good portion of the uk headwinds as a reminder the uk accounts drove over 80 of our revenues in this segment australia was down 8 in constant currency for the quarter a portion of this decline was unit related we ve seen a moderation in the rate of decline of same store transactions consolidated adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 33 3 down from 35 3 in q4 of 2017 similar to the third quarter this decline in margin is primarily attributable to the 7 eleven deconversion in us and the link interchange reduction in the uk adjusted ebitda was 68 5 million compared to 89 8 million in q4 2018 this result was of course also impacted by the 7 eleven deconversion and uk link interchange reduction sg a was also up 2 6 million in q4 versus the prior year and is primarily attributable to higher professional services fees adjusted eps was 0 47 for the quarter compared to 0 73 in the fourth quarter of last year it was impacted by the same factors that affected adjusted ebitda our fourth quarter was stronger than we had anticipated when we provided our guidance update on the third quarter earnings call and these results pushed us slightly above the top end of our full year 2018 guidance range for revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per diluted share this outperformance was mainly due to the better than expected same store performance in the us and the uk along with the continued focus on operational excellence throughout the organization capital expenditures for the year were 107 million this result was lower than 115 million we anticipated as we entered q4 this was primarily due to a combination of increased focus on capital expenditures as well as timing of these investments we finished the year with free cash flows of 118 million up nearly 60 from the 74 million in 2017 this increased cash flow enable a significant reduction of our net debt levels on a year over year basis of 113 million free cash flow and debt reduction were a major priority in 2018 and we will continue to be a major priority in 2019 we ended the year with total debt outstanding of 847 million grossed up to the face value of our debt instruments we also had 40 million in unrestricted cash net debt to adjusted ebitda was approximately 2 8 million as of year end during the fourth quarter we completed a major refinancing effort whereby we expanded our revolving credit facility from 400 million to 600 million and called and retired outstanding 2022 notes this refinancing allowed us to lower our cash interest expense and improve our financial covenants which will provide us more flexibility for capital allocation after investing in our business to generate long term growth we will still continue to generate significant free cash flow and in the near term we will focus on driving our net leverage to our targeted range of 2 times to 2 5 times now let me move on to our outlook for 2019 i ll first go through the numbers then i ll provide some color and a few other items consolidated revenues are forecasted to be 1 31 billion to 1 35 billion our north america business is expected to grow in the low single digit range and we expect our europe and africa segment to be about flat on the top line and australia to be down a few percentage points as a reminder we have significant interchange rate reductions on our free to use atms in the uk in 2019 but we expect the other countries in the segment to largely offset the decline for full year on adjusted ebitda we re expecting to be in the range of 285 million to 295 million this result is meaningfully impacted by the interchange rate reduction in the uk along with the property tax adjustment benefit that we recorded in the first half of 2018 and currency headwinds versus a significant currency tailwind during the same period the combined impact of the prior year property tax benefit the impact of two link interchange rate reductions and currency headwinds account for over 30 million in ebitda headwinds in 2019 much of it which is weighted toward the first half adjusted eps we are currently expecting a range of 1 94 to 2 05 a few moving parts and adjusted eps first the refi ph spoke about earlier should save up to about 8 million in interest expense this savings is being offset by an increase in depreciation expense driven by some of the investments we made in the last year or two in the in year effect of increased 2019 capital expenditures we expect our non gaap tax rate to be similar to 2018 at approximately 24 cash taxes are expected to be about 10 million to 15 million in 2019 versus less than a 1 million in 2018 this assumes status quo tax rates and regulations in our major jurisdictions we currently anticipate 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately 135 million while this investment is elevated compared to 2018 levels this increase is completely due to growth projects that will benefit us in late 2019 and beyond these expenditures are made up of three broad categories first we anticipate investing approximately 65 million in 2019 for growth initiatives primarily involving atm placements to enhance and expand our network along with continued growth in managed service contracts with financial institutions we also continue to expect strong unit growth in south africa spain and germany the second category of capital investments is it maintenance infrastructure and product enhancements we project about 35 million in 2019 to continue to invest in our infrastructure for items such as it security our erp implementation which we expect to largely compete in 2019 and technology development the third broad category is physical infrastructure capex which includes upgrades and security for our atms general life cycle replacements and other operating capex we estimate investing approximately 35 million in this category in 2019 similar to 2018 we will watch capital spending very closely and place an roi lens on each project all of our guidance is based on exchange rates remaining about where they are today which we have detailed in our earnings release as many of you know our results are most sensitive to the us dollar british pound exchange rate we have assumed a full year of 1 28 which is a little worse in 2018 average exchange rate of 1 34 let me close off the guidance discussion by talking about the distribution of ebitda adjusted adjusted ebitda across the four quarters while we don t give specific quarterly guidance i wanted to offer some direction as we expect significant year over year variability by quarter based on how we currently anticipate the year unfolding it really is a tale of two halves as we expect adjusted ebitda to decline year over year in the first half and then begin to show growth in the second half more specifically we expect the q1 will have the toughest year over year comparisons as it is typically our lowest transacting quarter and we will experience some tough comparisons versus prior year in fact the impact of the two link interchange rate reductions compared to prior year coupled with the property tax benefit we had in q1 2018 along with an exchange rate headwind equates to approximately 13 million of headwinds for the quarter therefore we see q1 being down almost 20 compared to the prior year while q2 was much stronger quarter for us we will continue to have the link in currency headwinds as well as the remainder of the property tax headwind compared to the prior year therefore we anticipate adjusted ebitda being a few million below prior year in q3 which is typically our strongest quarter we will cycle on the first interchange rate cut that started in q3 of 2018 and the property tax adjustment will no longer impact our year over year comparisons we also anticipate seeing an increased impact of growth from our continued sales efforts therefore we expect q3 to be the first quarter in 2019 we will see year over year growth in adjusted ebitda we currently expect the growth in adjusted ebitda to be relatively similar in both q3 and q4 based on what we know today we believe this projected stronger second half is a good indicator of future growth as we lap many of the headwinds of 2018 and early 2019 we look forward to providing a longer term view on our strategy and key financial metrics next month at our investor day with that i ll turn it back over to the operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from andrew jeffrey with suntrust your line is open andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst hey good afternoon guys i appreciate you taking the question edward h west chief executive officer and director good afternoon andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst certainly good to see the beginning of a turn in the us long time coming on that front ed can you talk a little bit about how you view the us market perhaps changing with the introduction of contactless i know this is something the visa has pushed pretty hard and it sounds like later this year and maybe in the next it s going to be more of a reality how do you factor that into your long term planning edward h west chief executive officer and director well thanks andrew first going back to where you started it is we are very pleased with the direction what we see in the us and the performance and having 6 same store transaction growth and frankly the double digit surcharge free growth is very rewarding and then getting back to organic growth and as gary put in his comments we see ongoing improvement next year as well in terms of the performance with positive withdrawals and inorganic growth next year as well in north america i m sure contactless visa mastercard others are working to roll that out and with retailers others and with financial institutions we ve seen it clearly and in other markets as well and we factor believe that that is we will see that over time in the us although but we also believe the opportunity that i spoke about in the us as it relates to a secular shift over time in terms of where we can support financial institutions and their needs for their customers as we ve talked about and then rolling out this past year with and seeing very very good performance with our various products in the solutions that we can offer them combined with allpoint bank branding managed services leads to overall long term growth for us and will go into more of that at the investor day and i guess the last thing i would say is the us market is very different from the other markets around the world with the diversification of retailers diversification and financial institutions and frankly just a consumer base here is very different and i think we ll all do well going forward andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst okay i look forward to details and as a follow up we hear a lot about allpoint and clearly it s point of emphasis for the company is there a point in time and if so when might that be that we think less we think we think about cardtronics less as a in the us anyways business that s tied to us retail foot traffic and more independent of that by virtue of allpoint monetization whenever that winds up looking like edward h west chief executive officer and director sure allpoint obviously as you point out is just absolutely terrific terrific asset and terrific network i would encourage you for all of us to think about it overall surcharge free because when we work with financial institution the ability to offer either through allpoint in terms of surcharge free network or bank branding products to really promote their brand and marketing at well known retailers and get a better presence into our particular markets and then combine that with the managed services capabilities scale the expertise and knowledge that we have those products offer together are a comprehensive solution for fi and then i think as point as you see this past quarter and frankly throughout the year we had double digit surcharge free growth growing at our retailers and we have great relationships which has been very valuable just the trend and the transition that you ve seen so i think we re pointing on more to the traffic there and i guess the last point i would just note on is when you have that double digit growth the traffic that s going to these locations is quite frankly immaterial what the recapture that we were able to experience from the change of 7 eleven of leaving obviously our portfolio which by the way was a significant portion of the us business to have that recaptured and to show that kind of growth that we ve been able to experience and recover from that this past year i think is a great great data point for the business and the strength in the value that we also bring to retailers andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst thank you edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you gary w ferrera chief financial officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from bob napoli with william blair your line is open bob napoli william blair analyst thank you good afternoon ed and gary i appreciate it the us business you point out has the biggest opportunity i think by far i d just like a little more color on how you re going to take up your market share of transactions i guess it s kind of big picture while you have 2 market share and if you go to 3 that s pretty good but the fi opportunity the outsourcing you have i think a new team team or you ve invested more in the team or what kind of metrics are you expecting i mean getting 200 atms and outsource i mean that s nice but i think you need to get some more momentum in that to really move the needle so i mean if you could give some color on how you re really going to improve materially your us market share of transactions and then some color on the outsource of working more to manage atms core financial institutions edward h west chief executive officer and director sure thanks bob so i think with some of the data points from this past year i mean we have double digit surcharge free growth at across our network is a significant performance and then obviously the beginning we re on the very early stages of growing out of the managed services i think that s an evolving market that will be years in the making we just step back and just look at the overall transactions that happened in the us over 80 of those are happening at a financial institution whether at a bank teller or an atm we are very small obviously one of the largest independently but small percentage it doesn t take a whole lot of growth there to be a material impact we will go into more of this on investor day and where we see that our market opportunity to be and we believe this to be very very substantial the way this will happen is just a disciplined effort that we started on this past year having the right people the right fi capabilities the sales force going in the comprehensive solution sale into a financial institution offering those surcharge free solutions between allpoint bank branding plus managed services driving more transactions again as illustrated working with both the retailers and fis what we ve experienced this past year a lot of that s just it s hand to hand combat working with our team with the retailer and the financial institution of bringing awareness to their customers and frankly tying our w2 ph and our teams and compensation to that performance and all of us aligned to seeing that growth i don t think it s going to be one of the things bob where it s all suddenly it s skyrocket into the next quarter but it s going to be a long term build on a secular shift in the marketplace and no one has the scale and leveraging capability to leverage on that than we bob napoli william blair analyst then just my thank you my follow up question is the back half of the year getting back to growth would you expect revenue growth to be higher than ebitda growth in the back half of the year maybe you are talking in the mid to upper single digits revenue growth or mid single digits what are you thinking gary w ferrera chief financial officer yeah i think bob it s probably revenue growth to be lower but ebitda growth to be higher just as you d expect from the leverage coming out of that bob napoli william blair analyst sure gary w ferrera chief financial officer but we haven t given anything specific revenue growth in the second half bob napoli william blair analyst thank you i appreciate it edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you bob operator thank you your next question comes from tim willi with wells fargo your line is open tim willi wells fargo analyst hi thanks and good afternoon two questions the first one i guess is a you ve touched a little bit on i think in a couple of answers but thinking about like the competitive landscape for cardtronics in the united states you still have while it s been consolidated there is still what i guess i would say it s a reasonably large market for independent deployers and isos and that type of competitor and i guess i m curious is we hear what you re doing what capex product development cost of capital energy you may have versus those sort of independent type competitors are you seeing anything in terms of what s driving your growth is there a loss where they no longer can sort of add that value proposition to an independent location or afford the revenue share for the cost of capital to keep up with the evolution of the model where maybe that s an element that plays out in your favor as well competitively edward h west chief executive officer and director i couldn t agree more in terms of looking at the various markets i think you just have to step back and view the segmentation what you re referring to is maybe into some of the smaller retailers and some of the independent operators versus larger retail base or financial institutions obviously our scale size capability security measures our breadth in terms of globally what we see around the world how we can bring that to bear in different markets and then frankly on the fi side the solution set that we have is no one replicates that because of the various products at the smaller end what you re talking about clearly our sales the size scale operating advantage buying power and frankly just information and security is it s hard to replicate so we do see that as advantage and something more in the area where we continue to grow and build on tim willi wells fargo analyst great then my second question and my follow up was again this goes back years ago there was a product roadmap around all kinds of different things analytics and different types of content and product you can bring to the atms i know that s probably taken a backseat the work you guys have had do over the last year and a half but just any thoughts around additional functionality revenue generating type capabilities that you see that could evolve into the marketplace into your revenue model in the next couple of years regardless of this year just curious any thoughts there edward h west chief executive officer and director sure it s actually to the contrary it s actually to gone into the front seat where our top priority is driving durable organic revenue growth and actually we pulled back as you know on the m a front reallocated resources and i ve actually been investing heavily in product new capabilities and designing other functionality and capabilities in particular with the financial institutions and we really look forward to showcasing some of that and reviewing that with you all next month at the investor day so that s actually front and center and it will build to out durable competitive advantage tim willi wells fargo analyst great thanks very much edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you your next question comes from ramsey el assal with barclays your line is open ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask you about the kind of growth algorithm of the company sort of prior to 7 eleven rolling off in the last couple of years i thought of it as and i think this might have been something that you all had put out it was sort of 50 new placements and 50 new transactions effectively flying over the footprint i mean how would you characterize the growth algorithm now it sort of feels like we re leaning more heavily toward the flowing more transaction over the footprint given how built out some of the key markets are perhaps but i m just wondering how we should think about underlying drivers of the business going forward in that context edward h west chief executive officer and director yeah that s great question ramsey and good afternoon it really varies by market with where we are and depends on the stage where we are in the business and trying to as i talked about in my comments here like in the us where you re seeing more transactions going through our network and we will continue to add to that build that by working very closely with financial institutions to support them and with their customers go into our network at well known retailers and obviously the roi on that is very attractive as we talked about earlier in the comments in addition to that we ll grow through fixed rate contracts through managed services which are long term agreements where we have lots of visibility and contract value then the rest of the countries different markets and regions around the world they vary by market whether it s new placements and or driving transactions we will share this with you and go through that next month at the investor day when we have as i mentioned earlier a market by market review ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst and so in that context could you give us sort of an update on i guess both allpoint and bank branding which are sort of the primary method currently where you re kind of increasing the flow over the transactions kind of a state of the state on allpoint and branding i guess in terms of like the allpoint pipeline are there more large fis in that pipeline i think that s what s been helping to move the needle recently and on the branding side you still have an inventory of company owned machines that are suitable and attractive for branding and is there a pipeline there as well just a little more color there would be helpful edward h west chief executive officer and director yes if you look kind of stepping back looking at the fi pipeline since as we ve talked about before again a lot of changes in the commercial organization the team the commercial leadership team has done a terrific job talent new talent new organization rolling out sales force getting very discipline on the market segmentation go to market strategies who we re working with in the financial institutions what s the value proposition and then aligning everybody s w2 to the performance that we would like to see and with having now a pipeline disciplined pipeline reporting still i would say sitting here today versus a year ago our confidence is up significantly in the pipeline in particular the fi pipeline is up considerably from a year ago and that s by the products as you pointed out whether that s allpoint branding or managed services and who we re talking to i think is probably the secondary i d mentioned in terms of the financial institutions it s just the size of who we re working with and speaking with in different markets around the country is ranging all sizes of institutions from the very largest to community based banks and credit unions ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst and then really quick follow up so on the branding side you have enough kind of inventory unbranded inventory to continue rolling out branding relationships or is there sort of a ceiling that will hit or have hit in terms of the availability of incremental units that are suitable for those types of relationships edward h west chief executive officer and director so today we have about i would say call it 37 000 sites that are brandable and about little over 14 000 of those are branded so there s headroom there is availability and we look forward and have conversations routinely with financial institutions on key markets i think another thing that s also changed over the last year or two the larger banks were on the move markets are becoming interest some banks have to support and defend the markets where they are other regional and larger institutions are moving into two new markets so obviously the interest level there is continuing to increase ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst that s great color thanks for taking my question edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you your next question comes from gary prestopino with barrington research your line is open gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst hi good afternoon just wanted to maybe touch on if you give us some statistics in terms of the allpoint network what s been the year over year change in the card base and the year over year change in the financial institution base and the numbers of cards that you re servicing now the number of fis that you have out there now on allpoint edward h west chief executive officer and director i would say if you over the year over year it s not significantly different because obviously you had the roll off from overall volume a year ago with over 7 eleven today we have over 60 million card members that are holders of that and that is growing the number of financial institutions as you know as we ve been reporting out is growing i think what s what we re really focused on and obviously is growing the totals but it s really the engagement of the base the awareness the knowledge what people have in their wallet and the use of the networking which is why we ve talked about this transaction driving initiatives across across the company have helped in bringing up that awareness and the utilization of allpoint gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst so your same store transactions were up 6 in the quarter is that right and 6 for the year edward h west chief executive officer and director total transaction surcharge free were up double digit gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst okay what was that like last year what was the growth last year do you have that ex anything that you lost on edward h west chief executive officer and director you tell that on an ex 7 eleven basis with had to pull that to figure out gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst okay but that s fine but it s growing and i guess the question i want to get to is what are you doing to drive that engagement edward h west chief executive officer and director that gets back into the transaction driving well first of all is selling new relationships like we pointed out this past quarter where we had 21 new financial institutions with a million new card members of that from for this past quarter what we re doing specifically working with them is with in particular the financial institution of awareness whether that s programs with their apps so that their customers are aware of that having locator built into their doing an email campaigns digital campaigns having temporary branding on key retailers around bringing that awareness to the financial institutions putting signage and awareness at branches and also having the programs with the retailers of bringing up the awareness so it s there s no one silver bullet it s multifaceted working with a financial institution and getting the awareness and we re seeing as we ve demonstrated seen the growth here gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst thank you operator thank you operators instructions your next question comes from reggie smith with jp morgan your line is open reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst gentlemen thanks for taking my question edward h west chief executive officer and director good afternoon reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst so great good to see the same store transaction growth accelerate in the fourth quarter in the us obviously you noticed that the revenue growth in the us was lower than transaction growth and recognizing that the surcharge free transactions don t generate as much revenue as surcharge transactions if you kind of help us understand how the margin profile of these transactions may vary from a surcharge transaction and if it matters or is the fact that you may own the allpoint atm versus not only does that impact the margin profile of those transactions just trying to figure out how we should think about the profitability of the surcharge free transactions gary w ferrera chief financial officer yeah reggie it s gary yeah it is very hard to get specific on that i mean there are so many different variables the advantage of the surcharge free obviously is volume right i mean we re trying to it s a lower price obviously but there is a significantly higher volume and then when you start looking down obviously it s lower revenue but on that one we haven t given out specific metric on profitability on surcharge free versus surcharge but as i said again it s all about the volume in that situation edward h west chief executive officer and director i would say also it does make a difference to the second part of your question on us owning the terminal and that s actually a differentiator where a comprehensive solution where we can manage that experience for allpoint as well for the customer and the financial institution gary w ferrera chief financial officer yeah where we own the equipment as we have better results obviously reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst got it okay so the way to think about it obviously on a lot of your transactions you have a commission which you split with the retailer on the surcharge free it means that it is safe to assume that there is no commission split and the retailers are just happy that someone is coming into their store is that the way to kind of think about that edward h west chief executive officer and director no i would say it wouldn t be safe to assume that there would be no commission or sharing but it is very important seeing the traffic come into the store as evidence of the growth that we ve experienced with double digit growth going into the retailers and retailers are very aware and value that greatly in these the relationships reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst understood if i could move over to i guess south africa and maybe even germany as well i guess you made a comment that you kind of feel like at some point that will help offset some of the pressure you re seeing in the uk obviously we re very us centric and there is lot of discussion about the us market can you kind of give us a sense of like what what does south africa look like from an atm perspective like what s the where are they in the transition to point of sale of transactions like who owns the atms out there i put it what that market kind of looked like if you can make it a little real or for us here in the us or maybe i m jumping the guidance which you re going to cover at the analyst day in a month or so edward h west chief executive officer and director well we so the last part of that yes we will cover some of that in terms of some of the markets and regions but i would just tell you from an atm penetration is at the lower end of the spectrum where there is lots of opportunity to the need for the cash across the country obviously we re based in cape town but have locations all over the country growing quite rapidly and the great news also have excellent relationships with the largest financial institutions in the country and helping to support their growth and their needs and we feel like there is a long runway ahead of us there in an attractive market but again as far as the lower penetrated markets that we operate in we ll share more with you next month reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst got it and if i can get one last housekeeping question you provide i guess bank branding and i guess allpoint revenues you break it out is that the entire revenue from bank branding or this are there also some allpoint revs that show up in the if interchange bucket like how is that is it fully captured in that figure you re hoping edward h west chief executive officer and director no it s not also it s also an interchange as you pointed out yeah reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst got it okay perfect thank you edward h west chief executive officer and director all right thank you reggie operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to ed west ceo for closing remarks edward h west chief executive officer and director great thank you operator 2018 was an important year for the company by transitioning allpoint and bank branding off of our largest customer in 2017 who previously represented about 30 of our revenues in the us and recapturing a significant percentage of the transactions in traffic on a remaining state we clearly proved the strength durability and value that our network and scale offers to both retailers and fis we had been relentlessly focused on our key priorities and are encouraged about the momentum that we re seeing in the business i would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication this past year to help transform cardtronics and position us for the future thank you very much good day operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for

more complete disclosure on our operations contingent resources estimates this news release contains estimates of contingent resources contingent resources are not and should not be confused with oil and gas reserves contingent resources are defined in the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook the coge handbook as those quantities of petroleum estimated as of a given date to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies contingencies may include factors such as ultimate recovery rates legal environmental political and regulatory matters or a lack of markets it is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage all of our contingent resources estimates are economic using established technologies and based on the average of the price forecasts of mcdaniel glj and sproule as of january 1 2019 enerplus expects to develop these contingent resources in the coming years however it is too early in their development for these resources to be classified as reserves at this time there is uncertainty that enerplus will produce any portion of the volumes currently classified as contingent resources development pending contingent resources refer to a contingent resources project maturity sub class for a particular project where resolution of the final conditions for development are being actively pursued there is a high chance of development and the project is expected to be developed in a reasonable timeframe the contingent resources estimates contained herein are presented as the best estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered effective as of december 31 2018 a best estimate of contingent resources means that it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate and if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a 50 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate for additional information regarding the primary contingencies which currently prevent the classification of enerplus disclosed contingent resources associated with enerplus marcellus shale gas properties enerplus fort berthold properties and a portion of enerplus canadian crude oil properties as reserves and the positive and negative factors relevant to the contingent resources

accordance with canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects to united states or other foreign disclosure standards reserves categories such as proved reserves and probable reserves may be defined differently under canadian requirements than the definitions contained in the united states securities and exchange commission the sec rules in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross or as noted above with respect to production information company interest volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalty and similar payments the practice in the united states is to report reserves and production using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments canadian disclosure requirements require that forecasted commodity prices be used for reserves evaluations while the sec mandates the use of an average of first day of the month price for the 12 months prior to the end of the reporting period additionally the sec prohibits disclosure of oil and gas resources in sec filings whereas canadian issuers may disclose oil and gas resources resources

analyze operating performance leverage and liquidity adjusted funds flow is calculated as net cash generated from operating activities but before changes in non cash operating working capital and asset retirement obligation expenditures adjusted net income is calculated as net income adjusted for unrealized derivative instrument gain loss asset impairment gain on divestment of assets

to china reuters reported yesterday of the disruption and the australian dollar fell sharply the slowdown of australia s coal exports may have begun last month and rba tried linking it to environment

keeps china s adversary off balance investors will be sensitive to data that shed light on these developments the reserve bank of new zealand warned that raising capital requirements for banks could

america president trump will reportedly meet with china s vice premier and point man in the trade talks liu he this is thought to help facilitate a meeting between trump and xi for next month a bloomberg survey found that nearly everyone polled did not expect tariffs to go up on march 1 however 18 of the 29 do expect tariffs to go up eventually there is much press coverage of the report indicating that one of the us asks is for a stable we suspect this is being blown out of proportion first it is not new or even controversial the us has expressed this concern before and chinese officials say they too want a stable yuan second the g7 and g20 have endorsed letting market forces determine exchange rates many observers see a contradiction between market forces determining exchange rates and the us wants china to have a stable yuan however the contradiction is more apparent than real one gets to a stable currency not be intervening but by pursuing balanced policies third the fact that the us housing market remains nationalized or that the us recapitalized banks during the crisis does not deter us officials from pressing china to reduce the role of the state in its economy suggesting officials are not hampered cognitive dissonance after a slew of data yesterday the us economic calendar turns quiet today but headline risk is presented by at around eight fed

no hurry to continue it by hiking rates the canadian dollar fell every week but one in q4 18 and is the strongest major currency this year with a 3 advance it has only fallen one week this year but this week s gain of a less than 0 25 could be under risk if the retail sales are disappointing note that there is an option for a little more than 500 mln at cad1 3215 that expires today and the

a demand from the united states that explicitly requires china to keep the yuan exchange rate stable as a condition to end the ongoing trade war plays right into beijing s hands and is an offer the government in beijing will accept said analysts the us has demanded that china stop devaluing the yuan as a condition of ending the trade war and the two countries may include currency policy in a memorandum of understanding that would form the basis of a trade deal bloomberg reported for years the us government had been pressing china to adopt a market oriented exchange rate system so that the yuan can find its fair value against the us dollar china officially scrapped the yuan s hard peg to the dollar in 2005 and adopted a soft peg under a managed floating exchange rate system allowing the exchange rate to fluctuate within a narrow range if the trump administration changes its focus on the yuan s exchange rate formation mechanism and specifically requests china to prevent the yuan from depreciating to a certain level such a demand will fit immediately into what beijing has been doing since the summer of 2015 according to analysts the reports that trump has demanded a stable yuan sent china s currency to its biggest gain against the us dollar in more than three weeks the yuan rose 0 51 per cent to 6 7242 per dollar in china on wednesday after earlier in the day rallying by as much as 0 58 per cent its biggest daily gain since january 25 a deal between china and us that requires beijing to keep the yuan exchange rate above a certain level would be a recognition of beijing s long held guiding principle of keeping the yuan stable at a reasonable equilibrium said ken cheung kin tai senior asian currency strategist at mizuho bank from china s perspective this would also be acceptable he added cheung said that china has already been making efforts to stabilise its currency to alleviate fears of yuan depreciation and to boost the currency s international appeal yuan stabilisation will be the optimal solution to balance out risks of capital outflow trade negotiations and china growth slowdown he added beijing has been relying on heavy intervention and draconian curbs on capital outflow to keep the yuan from weakening below the key level of 7 against the us dollar over the last year amid a trade war with the us which saw the yuan drop 5 per cent against the us dollar last year in the onshore market the people s bank of china sets a daily parity price in shanghai for every trading day that allows the yuan to move in a narrow range of 2 per cent up or down while in the offshore yuan market in hong kong the price is slightly more volatile but china s central bank still has an influence janet yellen the former chairwoman of the us federal reserve said on wednesday that the united states had been concerned about chinese intervention in foreign exchange markets to hold down the yuan value to stimulate growth and large current account surpluses for many years this was up until 2015 when such concerns were replaced by worries over downward pressure on the chinese currency especially since august 2015 when a modest devaluation caused panic in global financial markets added yellen people judged that perhaps there had been some secret accord that involved china changing its exchange rate policy in return for the us easing off on monetary policy said yellen who chaired the us federal reserve from 2014 to 2018 now let me quickly say there was no shanghai accord if that s interpreted to mean an explicit agreement or some secret handshake deal during his election campaign us president donald trump had threatened to label china as a currency manipulator because he alleged it was devaluing the currency to make chinese goods artificially cheap an allegation that many economists at the time viewed as outdated trump eventually backed down from this threat and the quarrel over the yuan cooled even though a tariff war broke out between the world s two second largest economies last year vice premier liu he will continue the next round of trade talks with us counterparts including us trade representative robert lighthizer and us treasury secretary steven mnuchin this week in washington from a pure trade point of view a currency depreciation in theory can offset the impacts of additional tariffs michael every senior asia pacific strategist at rabobank said if the us imposes 25 per cent tariff on all chinese goods after the march 1 deadline but china allows the yuan to depreciate 25 per cent against the dollar then not a lot has changed in reality however china is facing an uphill battle in keeping the yuan strong enough logically the only way china can keep their currency stable or stronger is to open up the economy in a big enough bang that foreign capital inflows exceed any outflows that s the deep seated structural reform that is a no go for beijing added every at the same time fears over yuan depreciation have receded this year because of a softer dollar as the us federal reserve slows or even ends its interest rate hiking cycle there are other market factors which may boost the yuan this year which may also affect beijing s decision on whether to accept a deal on currency one is higher foreign investor interest in yuan denominated assets with chinese stocks and bonds set to be included in more global indices said amanda stitt head of the fixed income product specialist team at legg mason global asset management chinese yuan government and bank bonds will be added to the bloomberg barclays flagship global aggregate index from april this will lead to around us 150 billion of potential bond inflows over a 20 month period or us 50 billion per month said frances cheung head of macro strategy asia at westpac source south china morning post
below are excerpts from a cnbc interview with greece s finance minister euclid tsakalotos and cnbc s silvia amaro q1 six months today since greece ended its third bailout programme what should be the focus of reforming the greek economy in the coming months a1 as you know we ve done a lot of reforms over the last 4 5 years we have a growth strategy that develops our priorities we have 3 major priorities in the economy one is speeding up the system of justice the other is continuing with public administration reforms and the third is improving the business environment those are the 3 major priorities and combining that we re trying to build up a social state a welfare state in greece for the first time q2 how are you going to do that you don t have too much time left the election the latest date we can have the election is the 13thof october a2 i thought a week is a long time in politics we have time we have a lot of legislation in the pipeline we have a lot to do with bank reducing their npls we have a lot to do with public administration i think the people are beginning to see in their pockets the difference as we come out of the programme they re beginning to see the effect of our housing policy all sorts of areas time is on our side people are seeing that we left the programme and they are seeing the strategy that we have q3 are you hoping that strategy will gain you more votes syriza is currently polling second in the opinion polls a3 you would expect syriza at this time in this electoral cycle to be second after what theysuffered don t forget they suffered the biggest crisis in peace time ever in the history of the last 100 years you would expect even that things are improving the level is still genuine difficulties and they have to decide in the election coming up which government is going to have that combination of policies that provide growth but also protect those who suffer most q4 can you give me an update on the state of those reforms that greece needs to implement by the end of the month in exchange for that money from the central banks a4 the major issue major issue we are facing most of the there was a long list of things that were mostly leftovers from the programme the structural adjustment programme we left so most issues have been covered like public administration like energy like the justice system the major issue that most people have focused on is the protection of primary residences as you realise in such a crisis people s life plans are distorted because they thought they would have a certain amount of income they have much less so we ve been protecting primary residence now we re moving into a new system where people will be given support to be able to pay back their loans so that s good for the people that will turn loans that are not being paid into loans that are green loans from red loans to green loans but it will also help the banks to clear up their non performing loans so we have a law which will be the new framework which we are now discussing both with the hellenic banking association and we re also discussing it with the institutions and the ecb will give us their comments on it which i think is a win win it s a win for people who have got a loan in which they are struggling to be able to pay and it s also a win for the banks that they ll be able to reduce their npl bills much faster q5 so what are the chances of that under 27 february the european institutions will be able to publish that report saying that greece has implemented all the necessary a5 i foresee that the most likely result on the 27th is that they ll have a report that says greece has done an awful lot of work there s still some to be done to just pass legislation that has been agreed by the time of the eurogroup of the 11th so the report will be favorable it will say that we ve done all this stuff there are one or two things that have to pass through parliament but they are agreed legislation so it s a formality till the 11th of march eurogroup q6 greece issue the first bond post bailout that is and it was quite successful there was a big cash buffer as well after exiting the third bailout program is greece in a position to potentially say no to that central bank profit money a6 well we don t see it as only as an issue of whether we need the money we see it as an issue that covers both the creditors and the institutions are confident that greece is continuing on a reform strategy so it s a signaling thing more than with the money thing of course money is always useful we don t need it immediately because as you say we have a cash buffer which means our debt is in a very good situation after the summer deal and that s why we were able to go out to the markets three or four weeks ago and why investors are confident in the greek economy and the spreads and reduced since we ve come out in the markets and the spreads in even the 10 year bond yield is much reduced so i think it s continuing with the reform strategy know what you want to do we do not surprise investors we provide this growth strategy i told you before where it had the priorities on the justice system the public administration on the business environment we also put in there that we would raise the minimum wage so everybody knows what it is about there s no surprises there is no that the hidden agenda whereas we have new democracy who promises huge tax cuts which i can t see where the money s coming from whether it s budgeted which is a serious issue for both i think markets and for people thinking of voting for new democracy q7 i m glad you re bringing new democracy to the discussion right now because yesterday when i asked kyriakos mitsotakis to tell me some of his proposals he did mention that he wants to renegotiate the primary budget surplus target i was wondering do you think this is a good policy renegotiating going back to the creditors and ask for a lower primary budget a7 i think there should be consensus across the political divide on this issue i think the three and a half percent and i ve said it for an awful long time is too high for especially for a country that lost 27 percent of its gdp i don t think this should be something that we should disagree about we should go together and say you know in a europe that has taken the lesson from the rise of the radical right and populist forces that such high primary surplus targets only feeds into discontent not only with the political parties but within the with the political process itself so i have no disagreement with the leader of the opposition that we need to do this and it would be nice if he had a less conflictual attitude so that we actually could have consensus on this issue q8 so let s imagine a scenario where new democracy actually forms the next government would syriza then given what you just said support kyriakos mitsotakis in getting that renegotiation from the creditors a8 of course of course we did we wouldn t change our position just because new democracy was in power i don t think it s very likely they will be in power but in the unlikely and unfortunate eventuality that they are in power of course if that was one of their main building blocks of what they wanted to do we would support them but we wouldn t support them in a large number of other areas especially since we actually don t know what their programme is my deputy minister the alternate minister for economy in the budget debate estimated that the cost of their announcements so far was 5 billion in the first year and another 4 billion over the next four years now we ve had no serious response from new democracy on where that money s coming from so you know we spent the 900 million extra not 900 billion 900 million extra in 2019 where the extra four billion to get to the 5 8 billion that they will announce come from god only knows certainly we don t q9 just one final question to finish this subject one of their proposals is indeed reducing lower is reducing corporate tax i should say do you think that a corporate tax of 20 percent in the next two years is feasible and what does that mean to the greek public finances a9 i mean the going to 20 percent would cost one billion so i would i would look with interest where that money is coming from but the issue is we i think we should have a planned approach so the greek government the present greek government has announced a reduction of one percent in the corporate tax rate every year so one in 2019 20 21 22 to be reduced that seems to me a balanced approach it seems a balanced approach because there has to be if we re going to come out of the crisis without greater political turmoil and without going back into a new crisis we ve got to take people with us so we ve got to have a balanced approach between cutting taxes and reducing inequality reducing child poverty so you need a balanced approach on these issues you ve got to and i think that going to be the main issue the new democracy s programme is too one sided kyriakos mitsotakis has been on record saying that he thinks inequality is in our gene that is not a way to respond to the serious social issues that greece faces q10 switching to the economic outlook of the greek economy looking at the budget plan for 2019 i saw that the growth rate expected is 2 5 percent of course that s based on the performance of the global economy do you think that you have to revise that forecast downwards because of course there s a lot of risk in the global economy and even the imf had to lower its own forecast a10 well in fact even though new democracy has for years said that we are laggards falling behind the other european countries that we have growth rates below now we actually have higher growth rate than the average in the eu not only that the commission just a week ago changed their projections upwards for greece and downwards for the rest of the eu so i think there is a lot of confidence in greece growth is back unemployment has gone down exports have had an absolute bumper year record year so the idea that we are not doing very well is just not sustainable of course there is as the finance minister i always worry about downside risks of course there are downside risks coming from trade disputes from the disagreements within europe about the future of europe there are a lot of things we can discuss about there but i think the mean estimate of what we expect is quite encouraging q11 the commission forecast is 2 2 yours is 2 5 percent talking about 0 3 percentage points but i was just wondering if in the coming months you have to lower your forecast a11 i don t see if the eu is becoming more optimistic than they were six months ago why should suddenly we become more miserable i would feel the opposite would be the case q12 and let s talk about external risks as well because there has been quite a lot of contagion in terms of greek bonds for instance since last year with the political instability in italy and i was just wondering how do you intend to shield greece from these external events a12 well we intend to shield greece by the strategy we ve been doing the first strategy is to have this buffer so effectively greek debt is collateralised for the next two years because of the buffer we ve created a debt deal which means that we have lower repayment schedules than countries like portugal and spain over the next 50 years that gives us the space in which to be able to have serious discussion with opposition parties with social partners to have a growth strategy that begins to reduce the debt to gdp ratio from the denominator in other words from gdp by having a serious growth strategy that s what we re trying to do we ve tried to protect greece and the markets by being very open about our policies on growth people can look at our growth strategy it s a it s a public document it s all budgeted there are no surprises and i think that is why markets are looking differently than us i mean the opposition says of course that we have higher interest rates than portugal of course we have higher interest rates than portugal because portugal left the programme quite a few years ago and we ve only just left the programme but the issue is that we re going in the right direction we re being upgraded by the rating agencies so we have every reason to be confident about the future q13 what s the message that you as finance minister would like to give to international investors because there s still some skepticism i should say about greece really a13 actually to be honest because i meet international investors as you imagine all the time i think that skepticism has seriously been reduced over the period i think people have seen the amount of reforms we weren t always that good at publicising our achievements i ll give you a little secret jack lew who was the secretary of america just before the changeover with the republicans said to me that one particular country which i won t mention has done half the reforms you ve done and everybody knows it throughout the world you ve done double their reforms and even your mother doesn t know it so we haven t been very good at publicising and blowing our own trumpet i think we ve got our act together in discussion both with financial community and with the rating agencies so i actually think because you know we ve publicised our growth strategy we ve only increased expenditure and reduced taxes to the amount agreed with the four institutions the ecb the esm the imf and the commission people are feeling confident about the future the greek economy they know we re doing lots of things to help the banks the banks themselves are doing taking private initiatives to reduce their npls we ve now suggested a strategy for an asset protection scheme which i ve sent to the directorate of competition in the european union so i think they re seeing the light all the little building blocks of how greece is going to come out of the crisis q14 let s look at the banking system then what s preventing the four largest banks from further decreasing their level of npl because we re still talking about 44 percent of npl a14 yes i mean in 2015 we argued for a big bang approach what was the big bang approach have a bad bank use some of the money from the esm to be able to do a one off solution now that wasn t agreeable to our creditors for whatever reasons i think wrong reasons but that s the past since then we ve changed track in other words instead of being a hedgehog that knows one answer to the question we become a fox that knows lots of answers so we ve doing lots of little that comes from aesop s tale by the way the fox and the hedgehog so what we ve been doing is have lots of little things to approach it so not only us the banks themselves we have committees where we discuss with the four banks with the bank of greece with the hellenic financial stability fund and the ministries to find solutions so we have done an ocw which is an out of court work out we ve changed the bankruptcy law we re presenting a new law about household insolvency which will also help the banks so we re doing lots of little things which we hope that over the next two or three years we will radically reduce the npls q15 how can you as a finance minister help the banks in this task then a15 by discussing having a consensual approach with the banks with the bank of greece with the hellenic financial stability fund with the four institutions that we are proactive and if there is a law or initiative we take and that isn t working we quickly able to see why isn t it working let s see if we can reform it let s see whether we need the same approach but with some amendments or we need to do a different strategy q16 i have two final questions one of them is looking at your time as a finance minister until now what s been the most challenging moment a16 well i suppose the most challenging moment was when i first became finance minister where most people offered me commiserations rather than congratulations for taking up the post and we had to discuss very quickly what are we going to do when i am now convinced and i think most people who are telling the tale now there were members of the eurogroup that wanted greece out of the eurozone and i think that was obviously the biggest challenge that i faced and the government faced of course and so i think we overcame that we found a compromise and more most importantly of all we took that compromise to the people i became a finance minister we renegotiated the compromise and then we went in september 2015 to the elections so once again we play with transparency we go to the people with what we ve managed to do some things have been very difficult for the people some things have been very good but they know what was on the table and that s what we tried to implement q17 your task would have been certainly easier if you had started as a finance minister back in january of 2015 if that had been the case what would you have done differently a17 i don t know i think that s for historians to decide i definitely think that europe at that time was not so willing to discuss the important reforms it needed to have a less austerity approach so whoever was finance minister i think would have faced very serious challenges i mean some of the things that syriza said that europe needs and the financial and economic architecture like a european budget like an european economic finance minister like a stabilization fund are issues that are now being discussed europe now is a very different kettle of fish than it was in 2015 i don t know whether it s going to succeed in improving its financia economic architecture but it is definitely part of the debate the level of austerity the kind of policies that the united states has as a federal state where it has a stabilisation mechanism that helps the states that are temporarily in economic problems which we don t have in europe these are now on the agenda and so i am quite proud that syriza actually did bring these things and a lot of economists support this a lot of governments now support it so we re part of a lively debate but i think in 2015 things were very difficult for whoever was finance minister q18 you mentioned in a recent interview that there was this sort of clientelistic politics here in greece when you first came to office has that changed a18 oh yes i mean and it s changed so much that i don t actually get asked for favours that s the final test yes do businessmen or people come up to me and say hello euclid you know we could help out in the election if you did x y that doesn t happen which is because i think they have a signal that this is a very different kind of government it really has been the sort of the black mark of greece and i m not just talking about previous governments over the last 10 15 years although that led to the crisis for the last hundred years the clientelistic system it has been a plague on greece and it really is a really important that that s why it s important to challenge that and that s why in our growth strategy the reform of the public sector is one of the three pillars as i was telling you earlier about it is dreadful because it was a system where you didn t make a decision on the proper analysis of the situation so let me give you an example until this government we didn t really have a forest registry so where are the forests we didn t have a land use so where can you put industrial production where can you put agriculture where for tourism you just didn t know but that wasn t inefficient because you needed the ministers or the general secretary of the ministry to speak to them to get the licenses yes so it was actually efficient for the system of clientelistic politics for anything you needed whether to build a hotel next to a resort or whether to have a chemical factory you needed the political intervention of the minister to be able to do it what we ve done is now people know where is the forest where is the coast where is the land use whether you can build a chemical factory because it s an industrial zone or you can t whether you can build a hotel near the coastline that is important structural reforms that this government has taken and they shouldn t have been taken a hundred years ago so i m not even being rude about new democracy and pasok i m being rude about the whole political system for the last hundred years q19 the international community is sometimes it s a little bit skeptical about the prime minister alexis tsipras and his position is tsipras the right man to continue to leading greece a19 well i would have thought that alexis tsipras is his shares have been going up for the last six months if not before because it s alexis tsipras and his government but especially i would say in this situation who actually solved our longstanding 30 years relationship with our northern neighbor this was a brave thing to do this is something which is very important both politically so that the balkans is an area of stability it s very important economically because northern greece cannot develop if we only look southwards and cannot look northwards and linking with northern macedonia to the sort of central europe and then towards north europe alexis tsipras took a huge risk to do this he was opposed by both new democracy and pasok who accuse us of populism but then when they thought this would gain votes opposed the deal the compromise with our northern neighbour i m very proud of that deal i m very proud that my prime minister was the person

it s unimaginable what great progress china made in the last forty years the rise of such economic power triggered many fears or hopes about the future international order we invite you to read our today s article about the rivalry between china and the us and find whether the red dragon will replace america as a global hegemon and what would such a shift mean for the gold market china us rivalry and gold the economic growth of china raises many worries while some people fear the slowdown or stagnation in the middle kingdom others claim that china will turn the existing international world upside down you see since the end of the world war ii the us has been the most powerful country in the world the soviet union rivaled but it was too weak and collapsed eventually the global hegemony of the us became total then however china which is now the biggest or the second biggest economy in the world wants to challenge this order some experts even claim that the world enters the so called thucydides trap i e the situation where the growing contender thinks that its position does not reflect its strength and that the old hegemon limits his development when we add that a rising power causes fear in an established power we get the recipe for a war in 12 out of 16 historical cases of thucydides trap the result was war as the table below shows table 1 thucydides trap cases of course russia also challenges the us hegemony but the country is economically too weak but china is different just one of its province has bigger gdp than russia and the chinese have really ambitious plans they want to create a new silk road i e a trade route running through the eurasian land as an alternative to the sea routes which are still controlled by the us and as gold bulls often repeat china tries to weaken the dominant position of the us dollar and strengthen the yuan the geopolitical analyses are fascinating but they have several flaws first of all there is a lot of determinism here geography does not determine the economic success or failure the central idea of geopolitics is that the country has to control trade routes to prosper and rise in power but the wealth comes from effective production not from controlling any particular geographical area we did not live any longer in the middle ages when there were few available trade routes so those who controlled them had monopolistic rents second the rising economic powerhouse does not have to intent to challenge the hegemon and the war does not have to occur as the table above clearly shows you see threat means a combination of capability and intentions there is no doubt that china has substantially built up its capabilities but there are no evidence that the country s military ambitions go substantively beyond taiwan you see it might be the case that china does not want to dominate but just to restore an equilibrium that lasted throughout much of the recorded history china s actual achievements are really admirable but they prompted many analysts and pentagon which has to justify its funding requests to overblow the country s position yes china is a rising power but given the amount of us military spending and its worldwide network of allies it is not a global geostrategic peer equivalent in power to the latter country the us spends on defense three or four times more than china and it can rely on help of many countries all around the world have you heard about the five eyes rightly or not the us is considered to be a cool kid while china is well a kind of a surveillance country it s soft power or ability to form alliances is thus much weaker can you name just two friends of china north korea does not count to be clear we are not saying that there will be no conflicts at all no we are not that naïve to claim the end of history china may test the hegemon but it will be wise enough to do it far from his core interests so as not to upset the us too much we are still decades from china being strong enough to threaten the us what does it all mean for the gold market well gold bulls should wake up and acknowledge the reality the chinese yuan will not replace the greenback anytime soon as it comprises about 1 percent of the total foreign exchange reserves held globally still a tiny share investors should not buy gold counting on that and china will not replace the us as a global hegemon shortly it s not strong enough its economy is slowing down actually the trade disputes and the debt burden inhibit the growth given the need for a shift of the economy from export led toward consumption led model of growth and for a careful navigating between the risk of excessive indebtedness and deleveraging too much which could lead to a significant slowdown triggering a military conflict with the global superpower seems to be the last thing the chinese leaders could wish for now so don t expect tectonic shifts in the international order and the resulting rally in the gold prices however we also have good news for the gold bulls the yellow metal may shine even without the atomic parousia what it only needs are strong fundamentals and positive market sentiment surely the current pax americana is not set in stone and it may change but be careful what you wish for you just might get it as for us gold prices even at 10 000 would be a poor consolation if the world falls into nuclear winter

ed edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you brad and welcome everyone our messages today will focus on the following key themes first we had a very good performance in north america this past quarter driven by a 6 same store withdrawals record system availability and solid new sales execution second we delivered on our key business priorities this past year in business momentum and confidence building this year we expect to move past the negative headwinds the ones that we are all way too familiar with during the first half of the year we then expect to have attractive top line and bottom line performance in the second half of the year which will set a great jump off point for the following year and established a trend for the medium term business outlook let me start today by reminding you of our 2018 priorities first drive durable organic revenue growth second deliver operational excellence and portfolio optimization third creating raving fans with our customers fourth engender employee pride and finally deliver growth and free cash flow and pay down debt now looking back on the year where we were about this time a year ago i m very pleased with the team s execution and progress so starting with the top line we return to organic growth in north america importantly we demonstrated the power of our unmatched retail based atm network and the value of allpoint our us same store withdrawals were up 6 for the full year certainly there were some tailwinds in the early part of the year related to the comps and recapture from 7 eleven but we largely cycled on those impacts in q3 and then exited the year on solid ground the same store transaction levels drove atm operating revenue growth in north america a 5 for the full year up from a negative 2 in 2017 when you exclude 7 eleven we also saw terrific performance and double digit growth in south africa germany and spain on the operational excellence front we achieved record availability in the us and the united kingdom which in turn drove improved revenues and lower costs we are now operating at availability levels that most banks and retailers cannot cost effectively match on their own we also reduced operating costs in several areas enabling investment in growth initiatives and additional security measures now let me turn quickly touch on something that i have not spoken about at length on these calls before engendering employee pride i know it s an intangible one that s hard to measure but this is an area that our management team is also focused on and i believe talent is crucial to the long term success of this business we have made progress on our culture systems and office environments change is in the air we ve got a strong purpose driven mission and we re building for the long term our team is truly making a difference day in and day out which is showing up on our bottom line and regarding our bottom line for the full year in 2018 we generated 118 million in adjusted free cash flow up nearly 60 from 2017 which was used to pay down debt in the context of losing 75 million in ebitda from the loss of 7 eleven the significant growth in free cash flow was a notable achievement for the year this growth in free cash flow is a result of organic growth in the us driven by surcharge free transactions to our existing well recognized and convenient retailer based network essentially more transactions at our installed network driving higher roi that factor is combined with overall disciplined operating performance and capital cost management moving specifically to the fourth quarter atm operating revenues in north america were up 4 excluding 7 eleven and on a constant currency basis this growth was driven by strong same store transactions of 6 led by double digit growth and surcharge free transactions from the allpoint and bank branding products in the us our transaction driving initiatives with financial institutions and retailers are working additionally we continue to add new partners to allpoint enabling 21 new financial institutions to our network in the fourth quarter bringing with them over 1 million additional cardholders new allpoint members include rbc bank in the us qapital an innovative and fast growing consumer non traditional financial services provider and visa enrolling their prepaid and debit card holders traveling to the us from various south asian countries we also had success with bank branding adding new relationships to brand over 400 new units in coming periods we completed a fi commercial tripled in the fourth quarter by adding several key atm managed service contracts with security service federal credit union one of the top 10 largest credit unions in the us central valley community bank and others in total adding nearly 200 new atms under managed service contracts these atms are located at branches and off premise locations moving to the retail side we added several new wins and expansions including the new placement contract with a leading operator of convenience stores located at airports and travel destinations adding high transacting atms with potential to add more locations over time we ended the year on solid footing in north america we experienced improving commercial performance at a new allpoint bank branding and fi managed service relationships in addition to the new retail locations this is combined with the great operational performance and same store transaction growth let me transition over to europe and africa segment on a constant currency basis revenue was down 3 for the quarter similar to the previous quarter the largest component of this segment the uk was down driven by the negative change in the link interchange rate in addition to the removal of underperforming atms over the past year these factors combined with the same store declines of 2 caused revenues to be down about 7 in the uk in the quarter our fast growing germany spain and south africa businesses grew at double digit rates as we continue to grow nicely in these markets we added great retail and touristic locations and layered in bank branding and managed services arrangements we continue to take action in the uk to manage through the headwinds as a reminder we were impacted by the second link interchange rate reduction on january 1st of this year we expect this will be the last rate reduction in the near future this is causing many changes in the marketplace we removed over 3 000 atms and transitioned about 500 units to pay to use from free to use in 2019 we are in the process of moving up to an additional 3 500 atms to pay to use it is a shame that link has caused such disruption in the marketplace when free to use interchange rates in the uk were already one of the lowest in the world these changes we are making will mitigate some but not all of the impact from this pricing change that said even with these uk headwinds we see a path where the growth countries of germany spain and south africa will largely offset the current negative impact to revenues in the uk this year we believe there are opportunities for growth in the uk once the market stabilizes and we ll talk further about this at the upcoming investor day in australia our revenues were down 8 on a constant currency basis for the quarter which while down was our best reported quarter this year we have now just about fully cycled on the bank s removal of the direct charge in the fall of 2017 market dynamics looked to be headed in the right direction for us as banks continue to close branches and remove atms the bank atms are now more expensive for them as to operate due to the removal due to the removal of the revenue over time this dynamic should be a positive one for us we generated an attractive amount of free cash flow this past year paid down debt and we now have our sights on reaching our targeted leverage level this year we expect to increase our investments in new product in the united states fund growth and infrastructure and still generate a significant amount of free cash flow after making investments in the business with an attractive roi and as we achieve our targeted leverage levels we expect that our capital allocation plans will evolve toward returning excess cash flow to shareholders we plan to share more with you about our plans for growth and capital allocation at the investor day next month now on that last point let me wrap up my comments today with a window into our upcoming investor day we look forward to providing more insight into our business and management team on march 27 at the nasdaq in new york we will share our vision our growth strategy our execution plans financial targets and capital allocation each of our regions have different profile so we will provide market and business insights across our geographies we see growth opportunities in all of our markets but believe the us business represents the single largest area of value creation as we leverage our network based business with retailers and fis of all sizes and build on our managed services platform we have the right solutions scale and technical capabilities to enable fis to refocus their resources toward other digital priorities and allow us to serve their customers cash needs it is our vision and goal to manage their cash transactions on our convenient low cost network this is a substantial opportunity and cardtronics is best positioned to capitalize on this evolving secular shift in the market there are many good things happening across the business and we are excited to share our enthusiasm with you next month and with that let me turn the call over to gary gary w ferrera chief financial officer thank you ed we entered 2018 focused internally on some key objectives such as getting back to organic growth operational excellence and focusing on delivering cash flows and repaying debt we communicated in our outlook for performance based on our view of the market at that time especially considering market disruptions in the uk and australia and the loss of our largest partner in us 7 eleven talking to you year later i believe that we ve delivered on these objectives and throughout the year we were able to raise our outlook several times as we executed on our priorities and had better than expected conditions in some of our markets such as australia with that let me jump into the q4 results consolidated revenues were 328 million for the quarter adjusting the prior year to exclude 7 eleven this result was approximately flat to the prior year on a constant currency basis fortunately this is the last time we will need to report our year over year results excluding 7 eleven as a reminder 7 eleven s impact in 2018 was limited to approximately 6 million in revenues and no ebitda in the first quarter excluding the 7 eleven impact the revenue growth rate in our north american segment was 4 for the quarter this growth rate was once again driven by strong same store transactions in the us which were up a 6 ph a noteworthy noteworthy in the fourth quarter was our same store surcharge transactions which were basically flat a solid indicator that while consumer payment options continue to evolve and be adopted cash remains an important tool for consumers and they like and trust our convenient and safe atms when there is a fee the solid top line growth in our north america segment was offset by declines in our europe and africa and australia segments our europe and africa segment was down 3 in constant currency for the quarter primarily due to the uk link interchange rate decline that came into effect in july of 2018 and same store transactions which were down approximately 2 for the quarter our germany spain and south africa businesses continue to perform nicely and are up double digits for the quarter on the top line offsetting a good portion of the uk headwinds as a reminder the uk accounts drove over 80 of our revenues in this segment australia was down 8 in constant currency for the quarter a portion of this decline was unit related we ve seen a moderation in the rate of decline of same store transactions consolidated adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 33 3 down from 35 3 in q4 of 2017 similar to the third quarter this decline in margin is primarily attributable to the 7 eleven deconversion in us and the link interchange reduction in the uk adjusted ebitda was 68 5 million compared to 89 8 million in q4 2018 this result was of course also impacted by the 7 eleven deconversion and uk link interchange reduction sg a was also up 2 6 million in q4 versus the prior year and is primarily attributable to higher professional services fees adjusted eps was 0 47 for the quarter compared to 0 73 in the fourth quarter of last year it was impacted by the same factors that affected adjusted ebitda our fourth quarter was stronger than we had anticipated when we provided our guidance update on the third quarter earnings call and these results pushed us slightly above the top end of our full year 2018 guidance range for revenue adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per diluted share this outperformance was mainly due to the better than expected same store performance in the us and the uk along with the continued focus on operational excellence throughout the organization capital expenditures for the year were 107 million this result was lower than 115 million we anticipated as we entered q4 this was primarily due to a combination of increased focus on capital expenditures as well as timing of these investments we finished the year with free cash flows of 118 million up nearly 60 from the 74 million in 2017 this increased cash flow enable a significant reduction of our net debt levels on a year over year basis of 113 million free cash flow and debt reduction were a major priority in 2018 and we will continue to be a major priority in 2019 we ended the year with total debt outstanding of 847 million grossed up to the face value of our debt instruments we also had 40 million in unrestricted cash net debt to adjusted ebitda was approximately 2 8 million as of year end during the fourth quarter we completed a major refinancing effort whereby we expanded our revolving credit facility from 400 million to 600 million and called and retired outstanding 2022 notes this refinancing allowed us to lower our cash interest expense and improve our financial covenants which will provide us more flexibility for capital allocation after investing in our business to generate long term growth we will still continue to generate significant free cash flow and in the near term we will focus on driving our net leverage to our targeted range of 2 times to 2 5 times now let me move on to our outlook for 2019 i ll first go through the numbers then i ll provide some color and a few other items consolidated revenues are forecasted to be 1 31 billion to 1 35 billion our north america business is expected to grow in the low single digit range and we expect our europe and africa segment to be about flat on the top line and australia to be down a few percentage points as a reminder we have significant interchange rate reductions on our free to use atms in the uk in 2019 but we expect the other countries in the segment to largely offset the decline for full year on adjusted ebitda we re expecting to be in the range of 285 million to 295 million this result is meaningfully impacted by the interchange rate reduction in the uk along with the property tax adjustment benefit that we recorded in the first half of 2018 and currency headwinds versus a significant currency tailwind during the same period the combined impact of the prior year property tax benefit the impact of two link interchange rate reductions and currency headwinds account for over 30 million in ebitda headwinds in 2019 much of it which is weighted toward the first half adjusted eps we are currently expecting a range of 1 94 to 2 05 a few moving parts and adjusted eps first the refi ph spoke about earlier should save up to about 8 million in interest expense this savings is being offset by an increase in depreciation expense driven by some of the investments we made in the last year or two in the in year effect of increased 2019 capital expenditures we expect our non gaap tax rate to be similar to 2018 at approximately 24 cash taxes are expected to be about 10 million to 15 million in 2019 versus less than a 1 million in 2018 this assumes status quo tax rates and regulations in our major jurisdictions we currently anticipate 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately 135 million while this investment is elevated compared to 2018 levels this increase is completely due to growth projects that will benefit us in late 2019 and beyond these expenditures are made up of three broad categories first we anticipate investing approximately 65 million in 2019 for growth initiatives primarily involving atm placements to enhance and expand our network along with continued growth in managed service contracts with financial institutions we also continue to expect strong unit growth in south africa spain and germany the second category of capital investments is it maintenance infrastructure and product enhancements we project about 35 million in 2019 to continue to invest in our infrastructure for items such as it security our erp implementation which we expect to largely compete in 2019 and technology development the third broad category is physical infrastructure capex which includes upgrades and security for our atms general life cycle replacements and other operating capex we estimate investing approximately 35 million in this category in 2019 similar to 2018 we will watch capital spending very closely and place an roi lens on each project all of our guidance is based on exchange rates remaining about where they are today which we have detailed in our earnings release as many of you know our results are most sensitive to the us dollar british pound exchange rate we have assumed a full year of 1 28 which is a little worse in 2018 average exchange rate of 1 34 let me close off the guidance discussion by talking about the distribution of ebitda adjusted adjusted ebitda across the four quarters while we don t give specific quarterly guidance i wanted to offer some direction as we expect significant year over year variability by quarter based on how we currently anticipate the year unfolding it really is a tale of two halves as we expect adjusted ebitda to decline year over year in the first half and then begin to show growth in the second half more specifically we expect the q1 will have the toughest year over year comparisons as it is typically our lowest transacting quarter and we will experience some tough comparisons versus prior year in fact the impact of the two link interchange rate reductions compared to prior year coupled with the property tax benefit we had in q1 2018 along with an exchange rate headwind equates to approximately 13 million of headwinds for the quarter therefore we see q1 being down almost 20 compared to the prior year while q2 was much stronger quarter for us we will continue to have the link in currency headwinds as well as the remainder of the property tax headwind compared to the prior year therefore we anticipate adjusted ebitda being a few million below prior year in q3 which is typically our strongest quarter we will cycle on the first interchange rate cut that started in q3 of 2018 and the property tax adjustment will no longer impact our year over year comparisons we also anticipate seeing an increased impact of growth from our continued sales efforts therefore we expect q3 to be the first quarter in 2019 we will see year over year growth in adjusted ebitda we currently expect the growth in adjusted ebitda to be relatively similar in both q3 and q4 based on what we know today we believe this projected stronger second half is a good indicator of future growth as we lap many of the headwinds of 2018 and early 2019 we look forward to providing a longer term view on our strategy and key financial metrics next month at our investor day with that i ll turn it back over to the operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from andrew jeffrey with suntrust your line is open andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst hey good afternoon guys i appreciate you taking the question edward h west chief executive officer and director good afternoon andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst certainly good to see the beginning of a turn in the us long time coming on that front ed can you talk a little bit about how you view the us market perhaps changing with the introduction of contactless i know this is something the visa has pushed pretty hard and it sounds like later this year and maybe in the next it s going to be more of a reality how do you factor that into your long term planning edward h west chief executive officer and director well thanks andrew first going back to where you started it is we are very pleased with the direction what we see in the us and the performance and having 6 same store transaction growth and frankly the double digit surcharge free growth is very rewarding and then getting back to organic growth and as gary put in his comments we see ongoing improvement next year as well in terms of the performance with positive withdrawals and inorganic growth next year as well in north america i m sure contactless visa mastercard others are working to roll that out and with retailers others and with financial institutions we ve seen it clearly and in other markets as well and we factor believe that that is we will see that over time in the us although but we also believe the opportunity that i spoke about in the us as it relates to a secular shift over time in terms of where we can support financial institutions and their needs for their customers as we ve talked about and then rolling out this past year with and seeing very very good performance with our various products in the solutions that we can offer them combined with allpoint bank branding managed services leads to overall long term growth for us and will go into more of that at the investor day and i guess the last thing i would say is the us market is very different from the other markets around the world with the diversification of retailers diversification and financial institutions and frankly just a consumer base here is very different and i think we ll all do well going forward andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst okay i look forward to details and as a follow up we hear a lot about allpoint and clearly it s point of emphasis for the company is there a point in time and if so when might that be that we think less we think we think about cardtronics less as a in the us anyways business that s tied to us retail foot traffic and more independent of that by virtue of allpoint monetization whenever that winds up looking like edward h west chief executive officer and director sure allpoint obviously as you point out is just absolutely terrific terrific asset and terrific network i would encourage you for all of us to think about it overall surcharge free because when we work with financial institution the ability to offer either through allpoint in terms of surcharge free network or bank branding products to really promote their brand and marketing at well known retailers and get a better presence into our particular markets and then combine that with the managed services capabilities scale the expertise and knowledge that we have those products offer together are a comprehensive solution for fi and then i think as point as you see this past quarter and frankly throughout the year we had double digit surcharge free growth growing at our retailers and we have great relationships which has been very valuable just the trend and the transition that you ve seen so i think we re pointing on more to the traffic there and i guess the last point i would just note on is when you have that double digit growth the traffic that s going to these locations is quite frankly immaterial what the recapture that we were able to experience from the change of 7 eleven of leaving obviously our portfolio which by the way was a significant portion of the us business to have that recaptured and to show that kind of growth that we ve been able to experience and recover from that this past year i think is a great great data point for the business and the strength in the value that we also bring to retailers andrew jeffrey robinson humphrey inc analyst thank you edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you gary w ferrera chief financial officer thank you operator thank you your next question comes from bob napoli with william blair your line is open bob napoli william blair analyst thank you good afternoon ed and gary i appreciate it the us business you point out has the biggest opportunity i think by far i d just like a little more color on how you re going to take up your market share of transactions i guess it s kind of big picture while you have 2 market share and if you go to 3 that s pretty good but the fi opportunity the outsourcing you have i think a new team team or you ve invested more in the team or what kind of metrics are you expecting i mean getting 200 atms and outsource i mean that s nice but i think you need to get some more momentum in that to really move the needle so i mean if you could give some color on how you re really going to improve materially your us market share of transactions and then some color on the outsource of working more to manage atms core financial institutions edward h west chief executive officer and director sure thanks bob so i think with some of the data points from this past year i mean we have double digit surcharge free growth at across our network is a significant performance and then obviously the beginning we re on the very early stages of growing out of the managed services i think that s an evolving market that will be years in the making we just step back and just look at the overall transactions that happened in the us over 80 of those are happening at a financial institution whether at a bank teller or an atm we are very small obviously one of the largest independently but small percentage it doesn t take a whole lot of growth there to be a material impact we will go into more of this on investor day and where we see that our market opportunity to be and we believe this to be very very substantial the way this will happen is just a disciplined effort that we started on this past year having the right people the right fi capabilities the sales force going in the comprehensive solution sale into a financial institution offering those surcharge free solutions between allpoint bank branding plus managed services driving more transactions again as illustrated working with both the retailers and fis what we ve experienced this past year a lot of that s just it s hand to hand combat working with our team with the retailer and the financial institution of bringing awareness to their customers and frankly tying our w2 ph and our teams and compensation to that performance and all of us aligned to seeing that growth i don t think it s going to be one of the things bob where it s all suddenly it s skyrocket into the next quarter but it s going to be a long term build on a secular shift in the marketplace and no one has the scale and leveraging capability to leverage on that than we bob napoli william blair analyst then just my thank you my follow up question is the back half of the year getting back to growth would you expect revenue growth to be higher than ebitda growth in the back half of the year maybe you are talking in the mid to upper single digits revenue growth or mid single digits what are you thinking gary w ferrera chief financial officer yeah i think bob it s probably revenue growth to be lower but ebitda growth to be higher just as you d expect from the leverage coming out of that bob napoli william blair analyst sure gary w ferrera chief financial officer but we haven t given anything specific revenue growth in the second half bob napoli william blair analyst thank you i appreciate it edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you bob operator thank you your next question comes from tim willi with wells fargo your line is open tim willi wells fargo analyst hi thanks and good afternoon two questions the first one i guess is a you ve touched a little bit on i think in a couple of answers but thinking about like the competitive landscape for cardtronics in the united states you still have while it s been consolidated there is still what i guess i would say it s a reasonably large market for independent deployers and isos and that type of competitor and i guess i m curious is we hear what you re doing what capex product development cost of capital energy you may have versus those sort of independent type competitors are you seeing anything in terms of what s driving your growth is there a loss where they no longer can sort of add that value proposition to an independent location or afford the revenue share for the cost of capital to keep up with the evolution of the model where maybe that s an element that plays out in your favor as well competitively edward h west chief executive officer and director i couldn t agree more in terms of looking at the various markets i think you just have to step back and view the segmentation what you re referring to is maybe into some of the smaller retailers and some of the independent operators versus larger retail base or financial institutions obviously our scale size capability security measures our breadth in terms of globally what we see around the world how we can bring that to bear in different markets and then frankly on the fi side the solution set that we have is no one replicates that because of the various products at the smaller end what you re talking about clearly our sales the size scale operating advantage buying power and frankly just information and security is it s hard to replicate so we do see that as advantage and something more in the area where we continue to grow and build on tim willi wells fargo analyst great then my second question and my follow up was again this goes back years ago there was a product roadmap around all kinds of different things analytics and different types of content and product you can bring to the atms i know that s probably taken a backseat the work you guys have had do over the last year and a half but just any thoughts around additional functionality revenue generating type capabilities that you see that could evolve into the marketplace into your revenue model in the next couple of years regardless of this year just curious any thoughts there edward h west chief executive officer and director sure it s actually to the contrary it s actually to gone into the front seat where our top priority is driving durable organic revenue growth and actually we pulled back as you know on the m a front reallocated resources and i ve actually been investing heavily in product new capabilities and designing other functionality and capabilities in particular with the financial institutions and we really look forward to showcasing some of that and reviewing that with you all next month at the investor day so that s actually front and center and it will build to out durable competitive advantage tim willi wells fargo analyst great thanks very much edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you your next question comes from ramsey el assal with barclays your line is open ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask you about the kind of growth algorithm of the company sort of prior to 7 eleven rolling off in the last couple of years i thought of it as and i think this might have been something that you all had put out it was sort of 50 new placements and 50 new transactions effectively flying over the footprint i mean how would you characterize the growth algorithm now it sort of feels like we re leaning more heavily toward the flowing more transaction over the footprint given how built out some of the key markets are perhaps but i m just wondering how we should think about underlying drivers of the business going forward in that context edward h west chief executive officer and director yeah that s great question ramsey and good afternoon it really varies by market with where we are and depends on the stage where we are in the business and trying to as i talked about in my comments here like in the us where you re seeing more transactions going through our network and we will continue to add to that build that by working very closely with financial institutions to support them and with their customers go into our network at well known retailers and obviously the roi on that is very attractive as we talked about earlier in the comments in addition to that we ll grow through fixed rate contracts through managed services which are long term agreements where we have lots of visibility and contract value then the rest of the countries different markets and regions around the world they vary by market whether it s new placements and or driving transactions we will share this with you and go through that next month at the investor day when we have as i mentioned earlier a market by market review ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst and so in that context could you give us sort of an update on i guess both allpoint and bank branding which are sort of the primary method currently where you re kind of increasing the flow over the transactions kind of a state of the state on allpoint and branding i guess in terms of like the allpoint pipeline are there more large fis in that pipeline i think that s what s been helping to move the needle recently and on the branding side you still have an inventory of company owned machines that are suitable and attractive for branding and is there a pipeline there as well just a little more color there would be helpful edward h west chief executive officer and director yes if you look kind of stepping back looking at the fi pipeline since as we ve talked about before again a lot of changes in the commercial organization the team the commercial leadership team has done a terrific job talent new talent new organization rolling out sales force getting very discipline on the market segmentation go to market strategies who we re working with in the financial institutions what s the value proposition and then aligning everybody s w2 to the performance that we would like to see and with having now a pipeline disciplined pipeline reporting still i would say sitting here today versus a year ago our confidence is up significantly in the pipeline in particular the fi pipeline is up considerably from a year ago and that s by the products as you pointed out whether that s allpoint branding or managed services and who we re talking to i think is probably the secondary i d mentioned in terms of the financial institutions it s just the size of who we re working with and speaking with in different markets around the country is ranging all sizes of institutions from the very largest to community based banks and credit unions ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst and then really quick follow up so on the branding side you have enough kind of inventory unbranded inventory to continue rolling out branding relationships or is there sort of a ceiling that will hit or have hit in terms of the availability of incremental units that are suitable for those types of relationships edward h west chief executive officer and director so today we have about i would say call it 37 000 sites that are brandable and about little over 14 000 of those are branded so there s headroom there is availability and we look forward and have conversations routinely with financial institutions on key markets i think another thing that s also changed over the last year or two the larger banks were on the move markets are becoming interest some banks have to support and defend the markets where they are other regional and larger institutions are moving into two new markets so obviously the interest level there is continuing to increase ramsey el assal barclays investment bank analyst that s great color thanks for taking my question edward h west chief executive officer and director thank you operator thank you your next question comes from gary prestopino with barrington research your line is open gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst hi good afternoon just wanted to maybe touch on if you give us some statistics in terms of the allpoint network what s been the year over year change in the card base and the year over year change in the financial institution base and the numbers of cards that you re servicing now the number of fis that you have out there now on allpoint edward h west chief executive officer and director i would say if you over the year over year it s not significantly different because obviously you had the roll off from overall volume a year ago with over 7 eleven today we have over 60 million card members that are holders of that and that is growing the number of financial institutions as you know as we ve been reporting out is growing i think what s what we re really focused on and obviously is growing the totals but it s really the engagement of the base the awareness the knowledge what people have in their wallet and the use of the networking which is why we ve talked about this transaction driving initiatives across across the company have helped in bringing up that awareness and the utilization of allpoint gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst so your same store transactions were up 6 in the quarter is that right and 6 for the year edward h west chief executive officer and director total transaction surcharge free were up double digit gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst okay what was that like last year what was the growth last year do you have that ex anything that you lost on edward h west chief executive officer and director you tell that on an ex 7 eleven basis with had to pull that to figure out gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst okay but that s fine but it s growing and i guess the question i want to get to is what are you doing to drive that engagement edward h west chief executive officer and director that gets back into the transaction driving well first of all is selling new relationships like we pointed out this past quarter where we had 21 new financial institutions with a million new card members of that from for this past quarter what we re doing specifically working with them is with in particular the financial institution of awareness whether that s programs with their apps so that their customers are aware of that having locator built into their doing an email campaigns digital campaigns having temporary branding on key retailers around bringing that awareness to the financial institutions putting signage and awareness at branches and also having the programs with the retailers of bringing up the awareness so it s there s no one silver bullet it s multifaceted working with a financial institution and getting the awareness and we re seeing as we ve demonstrated seen the growth here gary prestopino barrington research associates inc analyst thank you operator thank you operators instructions your next question comes from reggie smith with jp morgan your line is open reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst gentlemen thanks for taking my question edward h west chief executive officer and director good afternoon reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst so great good to see the same store transaction growth accelerate in the fourth quarter in the us obviously you noticed that the revenue growth in the us was lower than transaction growth and recognizing that the surcharge free transactions don t generate as much revenue as surcharge transactions if you kind of help us understand how the margin profile of these transactions may vary from a surcharge transaction and if it matters or is the fact that you may own the allpoint atm versus not only does that impact the margin profile of those transactions just trying to figure out how we should think about the profitability of the surcharge free transactions gary w ferrera chief financial officer yeah reggie it s gary yeah it is very hard to get specific on that i mean there are so many different variables the advantage of the surcharge free obviously is volume right i mean we re trying to it s a lower price obviously but there is a significantly higher volume and then when you start looking down obviously it s lower revenue but on that one we haven t given out specific metric on profitability on surcharge free versus surcharge but as i said again it s all about the volume in that situation edward h west chief executive officer and director i would say also it does make a difference to the second part of your question on us owning the terminal and that s actually a differentiator where a comprehensive solution where we can manage that experience for allpoint as well for the customer and the financial institution gary w ferrera chief financial officer yeah where we own the equipment as we have better results obviously reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst got it okay so the way to think about it obviously on a lot of your transactions you have a commission which you split with the retailer on the surcharge free it means that it is safe to assume that there is no commission split and the retailers are just happy that someone is coming into their store is that the way to kind of think about that edward h west chief executive officer and director no i would say it wouldn t be safe to assume that there would be no commission or sharing but it is very important seeing the traffic come into the store as evidence of the growth that we ve experienced with double digit growth going into the retailers and retailers are very aware and value that greatly in these the relationships reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst understood if i could move over to i guess south africa and maybe even germany as well i guess you made a comment that you kind of feel like at some point that will help offset some of the pressure you re seeing in the uk obviously we re very us centric and there is lot of discussion about the us market can you kind of give us a sense of like what what does south africa look like from an atm perspective like what s the where are they in the transition to point of sale of transactions like who owns the atms out there i put it what that market kind of looked like if you can make it a little real or for us here in the us or maybe i m jumping the guidance which you re going to cover at the analyst day in a month or so edward h west chief executive officer and director well we so the last part of that yes we will cover some of that in terms of some of the markets and regions but i would just tell you from an atm penetration is at the lower end of the spectrum where there is lots of opportunity to the need for the cash across the country obviously we re based in cape town but have locations all over the country growing quite rapidly and the great news also have excellent relationships with the largest financial institutions in the country and helping to support their growth and their needs and we feel like there is a long runway ahead of us there in an attractive market but again as far as the lower penetrated markets that we operate in we ll share more with you next month reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst got it and if i can get one last housekeeping question you provide i guess bank branding and i guess allpoint revenues you break it out is that the entire revenue from bank branding or this are there also some allpoint revs that show up in the if interchange bucket like how is that is it fully captured in that figure you re hoping edward h west chief executive officer and director no it s not also it s also an interchange as you pointed out yeah reginald smith jp morgan chase co analyst got it okay perfect thank you edward h west chief executive officer and director all right thank you reggie operator thank you and i m showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to ed west ceo for closing remarks edward h west chief executive officer and director great thank you operator 2018 was an important year for the company by transitioning allpoint and bank branding off of our largest customer in 2017 who previously represented about 30 of our revenues in the us and recapturing a significant percentage of the transactions in traffic on a remaining state we clearly proved the strength durability and value that our network and scale offers to both retailers and fis we had been relentlessly focused on our key priorities and are encouraged about the momentum that we re seeing in the business i would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication this past year to help transform cardtronics and position us for the future thank you very much good day operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for

mass protests and a general strike against growing poverty corruption and demanding the resignation of president jovenel moïse have shut down haiti for the past two weeks this mass movement is a direct continuation of the general strike that erupted last summer against proposed increases to the cost of fuel as well as the mass protests that took place last november in relation to a corruption scandal involving petrocaribe funds petrocaribe corruption the petrocaribe alliance was launched in 2005 by the chavez government and would eventually include 17 countries in central america and the caribbean at a time when oil was selling for over 100 per barrel the petrocaribe programme provided cheap oil and preferential credit terms to member nations these could obtain oil at a fraction of the market price and pay the remainder over 25 years at very low interest haiti joined petrocaribe in 2006 when préval came to power much to the irritation of the imperialists without access to petrocaribe the haitian government would have found itself in a very difficult situation as the high price of fuel would have gutted government coffers following the 2010 earthquake venezuela not only forgave 295 million in debt that haiti had accrued since joining petrocaribe but also provided funds for reconstruction and aid these acts of solidarity on the part of the venezuelan government were deeply appreciated by the people of haiti the petrocaribe fund providing cheap oil from venezuela has been plundered by haiti s elite image medyalokal haiti has accumulated some 2 billion more in debt to venezuela under petrocaribe since then the idea behind petrocaribe was that savings from the programme were supposed to be used for development and infrastructure investment primarily into housing healthcare and education after many years there has been no development and the haitian people saw none of the social benefits expected from petrocaribe people naturally began to wonder where all the money had gone the haitian senate released reports in 2016 and 2017 indicating that nearly 2 billion from the petrocaribe fund had been stolen by haiti s political elite the reports showed that there were some 1 7 billion worth of no bid contracts handed out by the government between 2008 and 2016 these projects were paid for using petrocaribe money but were never completed the senate reports and a january 2019 report from the superior court of auditors highlighted the disastrous management and embezzlement of petrocaribe funds some 15 former ministers and senior officials of former president martelly s government have been implicated including the current president moïse himself a company owned by moïses at the time was paid to construct a road but a contract for the project cannot be found the january report itself was incomplete and was unable to finish the investigation into the theft of petrocaribe funds a follow up report is expected in april predictably despite the flagrant theft of petrocaribe funds no charges have been made and there have been no arrests spurred by a social media campaign called the petrocaribe challenge a series of protests were held last year against the theft of petrocaribe funds and the widespread corruption in the country this movement culminated in mass protests and strikes that shut down port au prince several times late last year with demonstrators demanding the resignation of the government and justice with regard to corruption and the theft of petrocaribe funds the end of petrocaribe haiti s economic situation continues to deteriorate the foreign aid that flowed into the country following the earthquake in 2010 and the hurricanes that followed has essentially dried up it also seems that a lot of this money was also stolen by haiti s elites haiti was already behind on payments to venezuela under the petrocaribe agreement however with us pressure on venezuela growing in the form of sanctions haiti found itself unable to make repayments on its debts and haiti s involvement in petrocaribe effectively ended in october 2017 venezuela now cannot provide subsidised fuel to haiti because of the sanctions the reality is that haiti s fuel subsidy which most haitians rely on to survive could only be maintained because of petrocaribe with the petrocaribe option closed the haitian government turned to the imf which saw an opportunity and tried to force the haitian government to get rid of the fuel subsidy the imf has offered millions in loans in exchange for privatisations and the elimination of the fuel subsidy the imf argued that because of the theft and embezzlement of petrocaribe funds the fuel subsidy had to be cancelled as it was disproportionately benefitting haiti s elites this could only enrage the haitian people not only had the haitian ruling class flagrantly stolen petrocaribe funds intended for social development to benefit the poor now the people were expected to pay for it too the reality of the situation is that most working class and poor haitians cannot survive without these subsidies the proposed cancellation of the subsidy led to an explosion of anger amongst the haitian people resulting in several days of mass protests and strikes in july 2018 and the resignation of the prime minister not only has the haitian ruling class flagrantly stolen petrocaribe funds intended for social development to benefit the poor the people are expected to pay for it image jean nehemy pierre now that venezuela cannot provide subsidised fuel haiti has had to turn to us oil companies and pay us prices for fuel which it cannot afford this has led to a fuel shortage the shortage is such that there are long lines at gas stations and it also means that people cannot afford fuel for cooking or lighting and electricity haitian telecom companies don t have enough fuel to keep their cell phone towers operational and utility companies cannot provide power because electrical output has been slashed to deal with the fuel shortage many areas of the country now have only six hours of power per day while others have none scandalously fuel is in fact being delivered to haiti there are currently tankers loaded with fuel owned by us energy companies sitting in the port au prince harbour but the haitian government is cash strapped and in arrears to these companies who refuse to deliver the fuel until the debts are paid and payment is received in full in us dollars having lost access to cheap oil on credit haiti s budget deficit is spiralling out of control which has devalued the national currency against the us dollar the inflation rate has been around 15 percent over the past couple years increasing the costs of basic goods and putting things such as fuel food and transport out of the reach of most haitian people one man on a demonstration told the press that we can no longer stand this economic stagnation we have no electricity no security and now the sellers of flour and bread have decided to close their doors due to inflation so now we are approaching a situation of hunger riots again a woman explained that when i was little one hundred gourdes allowed us to eat until our stomachs were full now we cannot even buy coal to cook food adding that with martelly it was better with préval before him we had enough food to eat and under aristide my children were going to school capturing the mood of the people another demonstrator explained that it s been two years since promised to fill our plates but i cannot eat lies solidarity with the bolivarian revolution the last straw came on 10 january of this year when at a vote of the organization of american states oas haiti sided with the united states on a motion stating that the government of nicolas maduro was illegitimate there is a direct link and a real bond of solidarity between the bolivarian revolution in venezuela and the developments in the haitian revolution image public domain this was too much for the people of haiti in the eyes of the haitian working class and poor venezuela is the country that has supported and helped haiti the most through the lending of aid provision of funds for infrastructure projects access to cheap oil and the writing off of debts etc the revolutionary solidarity between the people of haiti and venezuela is real and tangible and not easily forgotten by the people the one country that had supported and helped haiti was now being betrayed by the political elites after they had lined their pockets by stealing petrocaribe funds there is a direct link between the bolivarian revolution in venezuela and the developments in the haitian revolution when cancelling haiti s petrocaribe debt after the 2010 earthquake chavez himself explained that haiti had no debt with venezuela explaining that it was in fact the other way around and venezuela owed a historic debt to haiti chavez undoubtedly had in mind the inspiration drawn from the haitian revolution of 1791 and independence of 1804 but also the sanctuary and support provided by the republic of haiti for simon bolivar in 1815 moreover the revolutionary movement in haiti that saw the overthrow of the duvalier regime and the eventual electoral victory of aristide in the early 1990s was an inspiration to chavez and the bolivarian revolution in venezuela the bolivarian revolution in turn became a major inspiration to the people of haiti in their struggle for freedom from capitalism and imperialist occupation venezuela and haiti were definitely linked in the minds of us imperialism fearing the danger of a revolutionary tide sweeping the whole region the imperialists targeted aristide along with chavez for removal from power in fact the tactics used in haiti to remove aristide from power in 2004 are remarkably similar to those attempted in venezuela to remove chavez and now maduro including direct coup d états bosses lockouts electoral boycotts and the fostering of a democratic opposition etc the masses rise after the oas vote on 10 january calls went out for rallies and demonstrations in solidarity with venezuela and the bolivarian revolution as the movement began to grow calls went out for a massive demonstration on 7 february the date of this demonstration was significant as it marks the flight of duvalier from haiti in 1986 and the inauguration of aristide in 1991 on 7 february haiti was shut down by mass protests and strikes centered on three demands 1 the immediate resignation of president jovenel moïse the main ally of the united states in haiti 2 proper criminal proceedings against the haitian political class for the embezzlement of 3 8 billion dollars from the public treasury and 3 support for the government of nicolas maduro and the rejection of north american interference in the affairs of the region the movement continued to grow and gain momentum over the next two weeks schools banks embassies businesses and fuel stations all remained closed roadblocks went up across the country disrupting transit and effectively shutting down airports moïse was silent until 15 february when in a public address he refused to resign and rejected the demands of the opposition he apparently wants to use the national police to drown demonstrations in blood and crush the opposition but there have also been reports that the police forces have been destabilised and that the protests have created massive contradictions in the police there are concerns on the part of the haitian ruling class and the imperialists that the police are in fact unreliable clashes with police have led to multiple injuries and deaths and there have been reports of severe police repression against demonstrators in some areas also including the involvement of un troops but the mass protests and strikes continued unabated until earlier this week with most services shut down for almost two weeks there was a lull in the movement earlier this week as people took time to collect food and water search for fuel and other necessities and clean neighbourhoods there have been no sanitation or garbage removal services for weeks the situation remains very fluid after the lull earlier this week the opposition has called for a continuation of the demonstrations on friday 22 february with one opposition leader saying on friday we will march across the country to get jovenel moïse out of the national palace the time for dialogue has passed and the government has nothing to offer the government s policies are promises that it will never be able to implement the government will come under enormous pressure from the imperialists to resolve the situation the moïse government is incredibly weak with no mandate or popular support now faced with mass protests and general strikes the popular revolt of the haitian masses could very well topple the government haiti haiti s economic lifeline has taken a hit expedia just made it worse pic twitter com uqjiqf9wft haiti now ayiti now corp haitinoworg february 19 2019 with no access to funds or fuel the haitian government has no real means of buying any temporary social peace they have no economic means at their disposal to appease the masses nor do they have any political capital to appease the political demands of the movement with the national police force reportedly wavering the government will find it very difficult to repress the movement with physical force this doesn t mean that the police cannot and will not attack demonstrations and striking workers but given the balance of forces it seems unlikely that the government could defeat the movement with police action alone there has been some talk of us imperialism sending humanitarian aid by which they of course mean an operation and coup similar to what they are now attempting in venezuela with no real means of dealing with the crisis the haitian ruling class will be very dependent on imperialism to solve the crisis this then opens up the possibility of some sort of coup supported by un troops or imperialist forces delivering humanitarian aid by demanding the resignation of the president proper investigation of the petrocaribe theft and punishment for those involved and by challenging the government s foreign policy in relation to the bolivarian revolution the haitian people have directly posed the question of who rules in haitian society it is very likely that the government could fall within the coming days or weeks in that event the question will then be what replaces the fallen government the haitian ruling class is powerless and the haitian people cannot and will not trust in any solution offered by the imperialists a deal brokered with us imperialism or the un would only mean the continued occupation of the country by foreign troops another temporary and ineffective political solution and the continuation of the same policies of humiliation poverty and starvation the movement of the haitian masses must reject any deals with the ruling haitian elite the imperialists and must demand the removal of all un and foreign troops the working and poor masses of haiti can only rely on themselves to resolve the situation and must take power themselves with the movement now entering its third week extended strike committees should be established and linked up in all districts cities and regions to coordinate political activity and strike actions these committees should then also begin to coordinate all the activities the government is no longer able to perform with the economy in ruins the strike committees should begin organising the collection and distribution of basic goods such as food water and fuel and organise transportation education sanitation and healthcare sources of fuel food and water should be expropriated and distribution organised by the strike committees only a government of the workers farmers and poor of haiti will be able to resolve the current crisis only socialism offers a way forward for the people of haiti the only way to permanently stop the economic chaos end the crushing poverty and develop the economy and provide jobs is to remove the rotten haitian elite and the imperialists from power the people of haiti are not alone in their struggle the current movement was sparked by the betrayal of the bolivarian revolution by the haitian ruling elite there is a deep sense of solidarity among the working class and poor across the caribbean and latin america the solidarity demonstrated by the haitian people for the workers and poor of venezuela will in turn not be forgotten they struggle in common against a common enemy by pressing their own revolution forward and striking a decisive blow against imperialism the haitian masses can come to the aid of the venezuelan revolution as in past centuries the haitian revolution today could be the spark and source of inspiration for a mighty wave of revolutionary struggle across the whole of the americas and the world
review and outlook third point s offshore fund lost 11 9 during the fourth quarter bringing returns for 2018 to 11 3 this was the fourth time in 24 years that we sustained a loss of over 1 in a calendar year and our second double digit decline although our performance was disappointing we took the opportunity to learn from our mistakes reflect on where our competitive advantages lie adjust our risk management and generally improve our processes to drive better results excessive exposure to unhedged long cyclical names and a risk arbitrage position in nxpi accounted for much of the year s negative performance we had too much long exposure during the fourth quarter which hurt our results in the october and december market sell offs a domestically concentrated portfolio drove our optimistic positioning while we saw weakness outside of the us we stayed constructive on us growth based on this view we focused too much on the fed s direction as the main market catalyst and missed signs of a potential turn in the business cycle single name shorts and structured credit performed well but these areas were insufficiently sized to offset long equity losses we reduced our net equity exposure during q4 and believe that our moderate positioning is appropriate for this environment despite a sharp rally in these first weeks of 2019 our exposure is consistent with our view that last year was a milestone as a decade of central bank quantitative easing that drove risk assets up after the great financial crisis gfc ended while our positioning means we have not kept up with indices in the first few weeks of the year we expect volatility to re emerge and are well positioned to take advantage of sell offs especially when good stocks are driven down in correlation trades or caught up in an etf or quantitative rout this is essential to generate returns in a volatile market environment it is necessary to be a liquidity provider at times of market stress and euphoria being a liquidity provider is the essence of our investment philosophy we have applied it since our earliest days as investors picking off securities from forced sellers in post reorg equities and demututalizations short selling through the tech bubble or buying during periods of panic over the past decade when we believed a fed put mitigated downside market risk likewise as the qe era ends and a new one begins we are reminded that new markets bring new opportunities asset class allocation and single security selection drove our strong returns over the past decade but so did new areas of opportunity coming out of the gfc we added competencies in investing and risk management deep analysis of global governments regulations and central bank behaviors by hiring outside firms and later bringing this analytical capability in house this effort was designed initially to protect the portfolio from macro risks but we discovered quickly that in a qe driven world government intervention was itself an event and this insight led us to new and profitable opportunities whether starting a structured credit business going long the banks and autos after analyzing the stress tests in april 2009 plowing half a billion dollars into greek government bonds in august 2012 entering japanese markets for the first time in 2013 to capitalize on abenomics investing in argentine bonds in 2014 or quickly getting long energy credit in february 2016 when we determined china was in better shape than the consensus feared an augmented analytical skillset gave us new tools to make money to generate superior risk adjusted returns in 2019 in a world of algorithmic and passively dominated markets classic stock picking is as relevant as ever if applied with new lenses machine driven markets are inherently more volatile machines price everything our advantage is in deeply valuing securities by being more nimble in processing information to exploit the imbalances and excesses in markets event driven catalyst oriented investing across asset classes remains the core of what we do there are four things we can do to create alpha that machines cannot 1 single name short selling 2 activism 3 opportunistic credit and 4 identifying mispriced intrinsic value securities these four areas have been constant profit centers for us with activism generating a 300 return since 2011 and single name shorts delivering profits and alpha in each of the past two years we plan to increase focus on these areas and have developed a new team structure to better support our fundamental research process with increased sector factor governance capital markets and data expertise we have a stable business that we invest in continuously since 2016 we have developed a robust data science and analytics team hired a macroeconomic specialist created a stand alone short selling team and brought on an experienced managing director to focus on refining our investment process by marrying fundamentals systematic inputs risk and positioning these new views combined with our core skill set give us the formula we need to invest successfully in the upcoming cycle 2019 macro investment outlook over the past few weeks investors have frequently asked whether we think the qe bull market can continue or if last year was the end of an era our reduction in exposures is driven by our view that it was the latter and we have gone from a qe green light world to a qt yellow light regime where volatility will drive investment opportunities our long standing view was that the business cycle could continue if the fed was reasonable in its approach to rate normalization to our surprise the fed signaled a continued need for hikes late in 2018 despite increasing evidence that non us growth was weakening and inflationary pressures were muted slowing global growth off a high level a slowdown which described conditions in the first half of 2018 is generally digestible for the equity market however once growth slows to a below trend pace a contraction equity markets tend to drawdown as we saw in the fourth quarter in december a plunge in previously resilient us business surveys exemplified by a drop in the ism new orders index by a magnitude typically associated only with recessions moved growth into a contraction zone coupled with a fed intent on raising rates and letting its balance sheet run off on auto pilot this raised question marks about the us economy s durability and prompted a correction in markets at the low in late december with a drawdown of 20 the s p500 was pricing high odds of a recession one of the major catalysts for the market s rebound was fed chairman powell s about face at the january fomc press conference which was remarkably dovish the fed curtailed the downside tail by effectively shifting to a neutral stance the market s euphoria in january was simply a recognition that fears of an irrational fed driving the us economy into recession were off base the equity market s path from here will be driven primarily by the trajectory of global growth while the data continues to weaken we are watching for signs of a bottom over the next few months the global pmi already has retraced more than 80 of its rally off the 2016 low while chinese policy is hard to read there are signs that the government s myriad policy initiatives e g accelerated local government bond issuance tax cuts rrr cuts innovative monetary policy tools will stabilize growth in the first quarter the sharp tightening of us financial conditions coupled with the effects of the government shutdown mean that us growth should bottom in the first quarter the euro area has been weak but reversal of one offs fiscal stimulus a lower oil price and export improvement due to china stimulus mean the bottom in euro area growth is not far off since the s p500 has now retraced more than half of the decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 seeing evidence of a bottom in global growth will be important to determine whether we are in green or red territory from here snapshot we plan to share some thoughts on market and asset class themes we are spending time analyzing via a snapshot in these quarterly letters our first piece written by head of credit ian wallace is on liquidity and the credit markets liquidity matters the state of the credit markets liquidity is free for those who can afford it very expensive for those that can t another topic we discuss frequently with investors is the state of the credit markets near the ten year anniversary of the nadir of the gfc today the non subprime mortgage market functions smoothly albeit with the gse s still in conservatorship us banks have deleveraged though saddled with regulation employment has increased growth has been slow but relatively steady and equities have delivered a qe filled bonanza credit creation has consistently outstripped gdp growth leading to record corporate debt levels however debt service the measure of the liquidity cushion is well within historical ranges one of the learnings of the gfc was that debt levels don t really matter debt service and liquidity do debt levels were completely irrelevant until liquidity dried up and the market came crashing down liquidity has been ample thanks to years of qe driving low rates but we have shifted to a backdrop of qt debt service measures will naturally be stretched as rates rise or the economy slows and it is possible we see both simultaneously the violent sell off in the fourth quarter driven by fears of this combination emerging was a sneak preview and it hit highly leveraged companies particularly hard while conditions have generally calmed we see unseemly bulges and liquidity issues in two areas of credit bbbs and leveraged loans bbbs the lowest rated investment grade category stand at 2 trillion twice the size of the high yield market we aren t especially worried about the liquidity of these bbb issuers in particular the liquidity risk lies in the market structure of the investment grade credit market widespread downgrades can lead to forced selling by investment grade managers there are several bbb issuers that by themselves would be over 2 of the high yield market which will swamp the buckets of index high yield buyers providing liquidity to these forced sellers has historically been a great business for third point while the bbb bulge has been well flagged investing at the tipping point is what our firm is designed to do leveraged loans feel like a historical analog to one of the villains of the gfc subprime mortgages subprime represented a mutation of the mortgage market and performed very differently from prime mortgages under financial stress ultimately helping to upend the capital markets we have seen the leveraged loan market undergo a similar mutation in 2018 there was strong demand for floating rate debt so we saw issuers shift from high yield bonds to leveraged loans unfortunately these were leveraged loans in name only as the graph below shows first lien leverage excluding add backs has increased over time from 3x to north of 5x today a peak that is no longer a first lien bank loan that is a junk bond hybrid that is likely to experience junk bond style default and recovery rates as their obligors face liquidity issues these mutant leveraged loans have been poured into clo structures and even etfs sold on the assumption of historical leverage loan performance when in fact like subprime mortgages they will behave quite differently this is obviously going to impact returns for the junior portions of clo structures while the clos themselves have term financing so they are a robust holder theoretically with no need for liquidity here the structure incents managers to sell for purely price reasons in fact we saw clos selling even during the relatively quick period of credit weakness in 2016 and we expect to see that again once we have a more sustained period of volatility going back to the gfc it was the methodology used for the supervisory capital assessment program scap that neutralized the worst fears about banks and convinced us to get long early in 2009 the key to scap was that solvency doesn t matter in the short run in fact with enough liquidity solvency never matters a dangerous road to be sure but the key to understanding both what was the trigger and ultimately the solution for the gfc credit analysis is a function of solvency is the sum of assets greater than or less than liabilities and liquidity access to cash to meet current obligations solvency is hard to measure the liability side of the equation is obvious the quantum of dollars owed but the asset side is complex ever changing and even subject to often creative interpretation liquidity by contrast is simple you either have the cash to meet your obligations or you do not those obligations can be ordinary course of business obligations structural needs or even emotional impulses looking out broadly at the credit markets while the quantum of debt is high we don t see the ingredients for another gfc although there is less gas in the tank to address a future crisis there is belief that the fed knows how to handle a crisis and in markets belief is everything we are not furiously preparing for a 100 year flood that may never come that said we see an underlying market structure where more than 50 of credit assets are held by entities that offer daily liquidity and 80 of the underlying assets do not trade on a daily basis this sets up one of the oldest recipes in the book for dislocation an asset liability mismatch while the fourth quarter was painful it again demonstrated the value of being positioned as a liquidity provider structured credit as we discussed in our opening section of this letter market transitions and dislocations have provided us with some of our best opportunities throughout our history by opening our investment universe to adjacent strategies this has been the most evident in our structured credit effort which we launched in q1 2009 we treat this asset class as we do all others focusing on events in areas that we think are mispriced providing liquidity when others will not or cannot and integrating our team approach to develop shared views among the structured credit corporate credit macro and financial sector teams exposure to the strategy peaked in 2016 at 24 of aum like our approach to corporate credit we can vary exposure levels according to the opportunity set and look for fat pitches rather than over allocated markets while our average exposure last year was 7 5 small by historical standards structured credit was a top performer for us generating a roa of 8 1 and beating the hfn mortgages index by 6 in 2018 we focused on short duration assets where we could monetize the strengthening us consumer we also created an active partnership with some investment banks to purchase residential mortgages and consumer loans to create our own securitizations we priced over 25 of these deals in 2018 we also generated profit by minimizing losses primarily by staying away from clos which hurt many of our peers last year we expect to grow our structured credit exposure in 2019 we are excited about the asset class generally as we expect that further deregulation will lead to new product opportunities although we are later in the credit cycle we believe that the next recession will start in corporates before moving to the consumer leaving room to maneuver if markets get trickier we are focused on the credit constrained consumer who did not participate in financial easing over the past ten years and did better on a risk adjusted basis during the crisis we are continuing to find investment opportunities in residential mortgages from primary mortgages to home equity loans partnering with lenders to extend credit to borrowers finally we are expanding into consumer credit opportunities from credit cards to point of sale commerce transactions position updates we expect each of our core active positions to generate profits this year through events that we expect will unlock value or as recent catalysts unfold the results of these positions should have a substantial impact on performance and an update on each position is below baxter international baxter bax financial remains the firm s largest position and third point partner and head of equities munib islam serves on the board of directors in past quarterly letters we detailed our initial investment thesis and highlighted the extraordinary transformation that ceo joe almeida has overseen at the company since joining at the end of 2015 baxter has generated more profits than any investment in our history we have used open windows to maintain the size of the position as it has grown through appreciation the best reason to have to right size an investment today we remain enthusiastic about the direction of baxter and the investment opportunity ahead as a framework we use the three major growth vectors that joe outlined during his first investor presentation in january 2016 1 operational excellence 2 capital allocation and 3 portfolio optimization operational excellence without question baxter has clearly improved operational efficiency over the last three years the company just reported fy 2018 results achieving operating margins of 17 4 and the company expects to extract further efficiencies over the next 5 years targeting 2023 operating margins of 23 24 capital allocation since january 2016 baxter has returned 4 billion back to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and used another 1 billion for business development purposes acquiring the generic injectable pharmaceutical manufacturer claris in 2017 and two approved products from mallinckrodt in 2018 despite this activity baxter remains underlevered versus peers with a net debt to ebitda ratio below 1 0x vs the group at 2 0 2 5x the balance sheet flexibility should allow baxter to continue targeted business development efforts although we fully expect the company to remain disciplined in its efforts portfolio optimization portfolio optimization at baxter can be divided into two areas over the past three years the company exerted more discipline over its existing portfolio voluntarily walking away from low or negative margin contract business further baxter refined its r d efforts to focus on high value strategic projects over the next 12 24 months baxter expects to start reaping the fruits of its labor with several new product launches including spectrum iq and evo iq pumps and new generic injectable drugs the innovation cycle should serve to drive revenue growth acceleration and contribute positively to underlying operating margins we retain high conviction in baxter based on expectations of continued development across the three vectors that should sustain earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years we have confidence that joe and his management team will continue to execute on his strategy driving baxter forward and delivering substantial returns for its investors campbell soup we invested in campbell in the second quarter of 2018 the company was at a crossroads earnings were going the wrong way the balance sheet was over levered and campbell s cpb financial long time ceo had just left with no successor in place it was clear to us that the company s problems were fixable but only with real change at the board and management level we fought a proxy war to help effect that change and agreed to a settlement in november that should set the stage for campbell s turnaround the terms of our settlement included a mix of board representation two directors now and one mutually agreeable director later and formal outside in engagement input on the ceo and regular access to the board and c suite once the proxy contest ended the dynamic between third point and the company changed immediately and we got to work within days two third point director nominees sarah hofstetter and kurt schmidt were added to the board sarah has critical marketing experience and kurt brings a wealth of packaged food operational expertise to the board we also worked cooperatively with campbell to help recruit mark clouse as its new chief executive officer mark is a seasoned packaged food executive and brings the right set of skills to lead the company at this critical time he started at campbell on january 22 and we are excited to work with him and the company s board to repair the balance sheet execute an operational turnaround of the business and explore all options to create long term value for shareholders with mark at the helm and change at the board level following years of underperformance we are confident campbell has a good long term case for value creation nestlé sa we invested in nestlé xswx nesn financial in the second quarter of 2017 at the time we saw a great company that had become complacent after years of success and an opportunity to help its new ceo mark schneider reposition the company for long term success we offered a path forward highlighting opportunities to improve financial performance capital efficiency and portfolio management and nestlé responded by announcing a series of financial targets that incorporated many of our suggestions over the past 18 months we have been encouraged by the progress the organization has made against those targets organic sales growth and operating margins have sequentially improved more than chf 11 billion of capital has been returned to shareholders through buybacks and management has smartly decided to accelerate this program management has also begun divesting non core assets e g u s confectionery gerber life insurance and recycling the proceeds into m a e g starbucks packaged coffee business the recently announced decision to explore strategic alternatives for the company s herta charcuterie businesses after announcing a strategic review of its skin health business in september was another important step forward we believe 2018 was a pivotal year for nestlé one that not only returned the business to robust double digit eps growth but also laid the foundation for similarly strong performance over the next two years and the potential for more than chf 5 00 of eps in 2020 we believe nestlé can sustain this new momentum beyond 2020 as the company continues to sharpen its strategy better align its portfolio around key categories and improve its organization to become more agile changing a company as large and complex as nestlé was always going to take time but it s becoming increasingly clear that real change is underway in vevey we remain confident in mr schneider s leadership and the path to create value over time and remain committed to constructively engaging with the board and management to help nestlé realize even more of its vast potential united technologies corp we are pleased that the board of directors decided to split united technologies corp utx financial utc into three separate focused companies unfortunately the initial announcement caused confusion and created uncertainty about the free cash flow generation of newly acquired rockwell collins we believe management has largely rectified this by shortening the time to separation and providing better disclosure on rockwell collins s free cash flow generation we have urged management to quantify the elimination of stranded costs and explore a highly value creating transaction for carrier and believe they are receptive to these suggestions despite the separation announcement utc s sum of the parts discount has continued to widen and the valuation gap versus utc s closest multi industry peer honeywell international has reached a new 10 year high the coming separation will shine a greater spotlight on the large valuation gap to utc s pure play peers during the separation process we expect the management team to highlight utc s asset quality and to increase transparency around pratt whitney s very significant multi year inflection in free cash flow generation sincerely third point llc _____________________ the information contained herein is being provided to the investors

washington feb 22 new orders for key us made capital goods unexpectedly fell in december amid declining demand for machinery and primary metals pointing to a sustained slowdown in business spending on equipment that could further crimp economic growth advertisement the economy s outlook was also dimmed by other reports yesterday showing a measure of factory activity in the mid atlantic region contracted in february for the first time since may 2016 and home resales plunging to a more than three year low in january the reports together with data last week showing steep declines in retail sales in december and manufacturing output in january strengthen the federal reserve s patient stance toward raising interest rates further this year minutes of the us central bank s january 29 30 policy meeting published on wednesday noted that some risks to the downside had increased with regard to the outlook for the economy the fed left interest rates unchanged at that meeting and discarded promises of further gradual increases in borrowing costs advertisement it appears the bloom is off the economic expansion rose said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the data don t paint a picture of strong growth going forward the commerce department said orders for non defence capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans dropped 0 7 per cent data for november was revised down to show these so called core capital goods orders falling 1 0 per cent instead of declining 0 6 per cent as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0 2 per cent in december core capital goods orders increased 6 1 per cent on a year on year basis advertisement shipments of core capital goods rose 0 5 per cent in december after an unrevised 0 2 per cent drop in the prior month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement while the rebound in core capital goods shipments suggests continued moderate growth in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter the surprise drop in orders points to weakness in the months ahead the december report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on january 25 the commerce department said the processing and data quality were monitored throughout and response and coverage rates were at or above normal levels for this release the dollar trimmed gains versus a basket of currencies on the data and stocks on wall street were trading lower us treasury prices fell darkening clouds the softening business spending outlook was highlighted by a another report yesterday from the philadelphia fed showing its manufacturing activity index dropped to a reading of 4 1 this month from 17 0 in january that was the first negative reading since may 2016 a reading below zero indicates contraction in the region s manufacturing sector however manufacturers in the region that covers eastern pennsylvania southern new jersey and delaware remained generally upbeat about business conditions over the next six months business spending on equipment has been slowing since the second quarter of 2018 despite the white house s us 1 5 trillion rm6 1 trillion tax cut some companies including apple used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale a survey last month showed lower taxes had not caused companies to change hiring or investment plans there was more bad news from the housing market which has lagged other sectors in a third report the national association of realtors said existing home sales dropped 1 2 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 94 million units last month the lowest level since november 2015 but prospects for the housing market are improving with mortgage rates declining to a one year low and house price inflation slowing which could make home buying more appealing for now the weak housing market is more evidence that the economy struggled early in 2019 after hitting a soft patch in the fourth quarter but the bigger picture is that a slowing economy as well as the continued problem of a lack of inventory will keep a lid on sales growth this year said matthew pointon property economist at capital economics in new york a fourth report from the conference board showed a measure of future us economic activity slipped in january after being unchanged in december amid predictions of a considerable deceleration in growth by the end of 2019 jpmorgan trimmed its gdp growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 by one tenth of a percentage point to a 1 4 percent rate the government will publish the fourth quarter gdp report next thursday the economy grew at a 3 4 percent pace in the third quarter the economy s outlook has been clouded by fears of a sharp slowdown in global growth especially in china and europe fading fiscal stimulus trade tensions as well as uncertainty regarding britain s departure from the european union despite the darkening clouds the labour market remains strong though the trend in layoffs has been indicating some weakness in a fifth report on thursday the labor department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23 000 to a seasonally adjusted 216 000 for the week ended feb 16 but the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility rose 4 000 to 235 750 last week the highest level since january 2018 it looks like the labour market has cooled lately and this is not too surprising given that job growth has been robust in recent months despite other signs that the economy has slowed said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york reuters
beware enemies hiding in plain sight the audi in the driveway and that bmw creeping around the corner are threats to national security these days it s not the reds under the bed americans need to worry about it s the mercs on the lurk beware enemies hiding in plain sight the audi in the driveway and that bmw creeping around the corner are threats to national security these days it s not the reds under the bed americans need to worry about it s the mercs on the lurk or so the trump administration appears to have concluded a leaked copy of a commerce department report delivered to president donald trump on feb 17 deems imports of automobiles and auto parts a threat to u s national security that is preposterous especially when they are made in countries such as germany britain and japan that are long standing u s allies this blatant protectionist ploy provides trump with a legal loophole to impose punitive tariffs on u s imports of cars and car parts within 90 days for now he is using that threat as leverage in ongoing trade talks with the european union in which the eu had already offered to abolish its 10 percent tariff on u s car imports for trump a key objective of those talks is to slash the u s trade deficit in goods with the eu cars and car parts accounted for around 45 billion of that 168 billion deficit in the year to the third quarter of 2018 the united states also had a surplus in services of 55 billion if trump decides to follow through with these tariffs it would be an abuse of presidential power as egregious as the bogus national emergency that he has declared on the u s mexican border it would also spark a devastating new trade war at a time when economies and markets are fragile u s relations with europe are at an all time low and tensions with china are growing on trade and other fronts trump has already slapped stiff duties on around 300 billion of u s imports 250 billion from china 41 billion of steel and aluminum and some 10 billion of washing machines and solar panels adding cars to that list would greatly raise the stakes in the year to november 2018 the united states imported 371 billion worth of motor vehicles and parts which account for nearly 15 percent of its total goods imports while the united states already levies a 25 percent tariff on light trucks to protect domestic automakers and therefore imports relatively few its duty on cars and many car parts is only 2 5 percent hiking this to 25 percent as trump has threatened to do would potentially be the single biggest protectionist act by a u s president since richard nixon imposed a short lived 10 percent surcharge on all imports in 1971 it would dwarf the so called voluntary export restraints to which japanese carmakers agreed at the start of ronald reagan s presidency in 1981 which lasted until 1994 one study suggests sustained 25 percent tariffs could nearly halve german car exports to the united states which totaled 21 7 billion in 2017 overall in 2017 the united states imported 62 6 billion of vehicles and parts from the eu which has already announced that it would retaliate with tariffs against 20 billion euros 22 7 billion of politically sensitive u s products if trump targets those eu exports the impact on japan from which the u s imported 56 7 billion of vehicles and parts in 2017 would also be severe and unless canada and mexico were exempted the blow to integrated north american supply chains would be calamitous the united states imported nearly 175 billion in vehicles and parts from its nafta partners in 2017 last year the three governments concluded a new united states mexico canada agreement that will replace nafta but only when it is ratified by the u s congress in which the democrats now control the house of representatives the first hit from an automotive trade war would be to fragile financial markets after tanking late last year stock markets have rebounded this year in part thanks to hopes that trump will soon reach a peaceful resolution of his trade war with china failing which u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese imports are set to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent on march 2 opening up a new global front over cars could dash investor confidence and sap belief in the durability of any deal trump strikes with china since trump seems to view the dow jones industrial average as a barometer of his performance as president this would be a personal blow as well as a financial one more importantly the financial fallout would compound the economic damage to the u s and global economy for most americans a car is their biggest single purchase after housing which is also an investment so a hike in prices would hurt and feed through into inflation toyota estimates that the cost of importing a car from japan would rise by 6 000 while it might absorb some of that cost in lower margins sticker prices would inevitably rise substantially taxing foreign car parts would also harm u s based manufacturers that rely on them costing jobs and crimping exports take general motors chevrolet bolt an ostensibly american car that is assembled in detroit it actually contains only 20 percent u s and canadian content so a 25 percent duty on its many imported parts would push up the cost of the car significantly denting sales and potentially encouraging gm to shift export production overseas a further lurch toward protectionism would also dent economic growth which is already slowing both in the united states and globally a recent citibank report which is not yet publicly available calculates that the combination of 25 percent tariffs on auto and auto parts imports with exemptions for canada and mexico and the eu s likely retaliatory measures would cut global growth by 0 2 percentage points this year and 0 3 points in 2020 that would cost jobs and shrink incomes in the eu but perversely from trump s perspective the united states would be the hardest hit by 0 3 percentage points in each year in part due to the expected impact on business confidence and market sentiment and the damage could be even greater if canada and mexico are also targeted supply chains are disrupted more significantly and broader business confidence takes a hit politically slapping tariffs on european car exports on bogus national security grounds would deal yet another blow to both the battered western alliance and world trade organization rules trump s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on national security grounds has already been challenged at the wto by the eu and others this places the wto in a lose lose conundrum failing to rule against the united states would provide carte blanche for others to use national security as a pretext for protectionism while ruling against washington on such an ostensibly sensitive matter of national sovereignty would invite a furious response from trump and could provide a pretext for him to pull the united states out of the wto as he has previously threatened it is often said that relations between the united states and europe are at their lowest ebb since 2003 in the run up to the iraq war which france and germany opposed but today s trans atlantic rift is actually much worse whereas then president george w bush maintained washington s longstanding support for european integration trump has called the eu a foe in part because the union gives members greater collective clout whereas bush expanded the membership of the north atlantic treaty organization trump has threatened to pull out of the mutual defense club and while bush bridled at international rules that constrained u s autonomy his administration still had much greater consideration for the united nations the wto and u s allies than trump who treats them all with contempt for instance in 2003 bush lifted tariffs he had imposed on steel imports the year before after the wto ruled against them and the eu threatened further retaliation the trans atlantic chasm was in full view at last weekend s munich security conference a sort of davos for defense u s vice president mike pence s regurgitated america first mantras were greeted with stony silence while german chancellor angela merkel s full throated defense of rules based multilateralism was cheered to the rafters trump doubtless doesn t care he thinks the united states can bully weaker powers and force them to comply with its demands but while the united states is still the most powerful country on earth it cannot take on the rest of the world and win alienating traditional allies will also make it much harder to gain their support in challenging a rising china which many in washington increasingly view as a military threat as well as an economic and technological one economically protectionism is unlikely to shrink the u s trade deficit with the eu which has little to do with its generally low trade barriers the overall u s trade deficit widened last year even as trump imposed tariffs left right and center in part because his tax cuts boosted consumer spending including on imports while the federal reserve s rate hikes strengthened the dollar making imports cheaper and u s exports pricier on the european side trump would have more success and more international support if he instead pressed germany and other eurozone countries with large surpluses to boost domestic demand and thus their own imports including ones made in the united states nor is pushing up the cost of producing cars in the united states likely to lead to a revival of its manufacturing heartland let alone the return of factory jobs that are being automated away in fact the biggest potential for the u s car industry lies in electric vehicles in which u s based tesla is a global leader and german manufacturers are laggards if trump wasn t so fixated on the trade battles of the past and in denial about climate change he could be championing increased research and development spending on the electric car industry and a more moderate and market friendly version of the democrats green new deal unlike german cars carbon emissions really are a threat to national security and tackling them could create more jobs and prosperity in the united states and elsewhere

amol agrawal along with the statement on monetary policy the reserve bank of india rbi also releases a statement on developmental and regulatory policies sdrp which lists changes in the banking and market regulations in its october 2018 policy one of the changes in sdrp was related to regulatory oversight of benchmark administrators story continues below advertisement remove ad the central bank recently put out draft guidelines on the regulatory framework for financial benchmarks most people are likely to have ignored these guidelines because they are not sure what it means however these developments are part of global changes in financial markets which are important so what do we mean by financial benchmarks financial benchmark india private ltd fbil explains it as financial benchmarks are indices values or reference rates used for the purpose of pricing settlement and valuation of financial contracts globally huge volumes of financial transactions are referenced to or valued using various such benchmarks thus in equity markets bse sensex or nifty serve as benchmarks in debt bond markets there are inter bank interest rates in forex markets there are reference exchange rates therefore one can say reference rates market is the soft infrastructure required for the functioning of financial markets the most important such benchmark for interest rates is the london inter bank offered rate libor which was developed by the british bankers association bba in 1986 first the bba polls 18 select banks on their view on the cost of funds in the inter bank market second using the trimmed mean approach bba rejects the highest and lowest four rates third it calculates the average of the middle 10 banks to arrive at the libor after the 2008 global financial crisis inquiries revealed that these select banks were colluding and underreporting libor this in turn led to overall lower interest rates in inter bank markets allowing the same banks to profit this disrupted the soft infrastructure the colluding banks were fined heavily for their misconduct but this could not prevent erosion of trust in financial markets in order to restore trust and design new benchmarks regulators decided to stop using polled rates and instead use market based interest rates on actual transactions the mighty libor is now going to be phased out by 2021 uk s financial conduct authority is working out a mechanism to help facilitate this transition in london s financial markets story continues below advertisement remove ad as a result most countries are instituting changes to market driven benchmarks in 2014 the federal reserve convened the alternative reference rates committee arrc which opted for secured overnight financing rate or sofr as the alternative to libor new york fed administers and publishes sofr similarly uk is moving to sterling overnight index average sonia canada is moving to the canadian dollar offered rate australia to bank bill swap rate or bbsw and the eurosystem to euro short term rate ester both the international organisation of securities commissions iosco and financial stability board fsb are coordinating these efforts at the global level india is also addressing these challenges in june 2013 rbi instituted a committee to review the existing financial benchmarks which noted that the calculation of benchmarks in india was satisfactory but the governance framework needs redressal they suggested that fixed income money markets and derivatives association fimmda and foreign exchange dealers association of india fedai may be designated as administrators for all rupee interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks respectively with rbi playing the role of an overseer in order to avoid conflicts the committee recommended establishing a separate independent structure either jointly or separately for administration of the benchmarks on the lines of singapore fbil is an outcome of this recommendation it started with administering the mumbai inter bank offer rate mibor rate which was earlier managed by the national stock exchange and is now computed on previous transactions and not polls as was the case earlier fibil is gradually taking up responsibilities for managing other benchmarks such as reference rates for the foreign exchange rate as announced in july 2018 the recent rbi guidelines noted above are to regulate these benchmark organisations which will gradually assume an important status in financial markets to sum up the global financial crisis shook the very foundations of financial markets with financial benchmarks being one of them global authorities particularly central banks are now working on alternate benchmarks given their importance in running financial markets indian policymakers have done well to show alacrity to these ongoing global developments and instituting changes looking at both domestic context and global practices this is welcome and should be followed in other domains of economic policy as well amol agrawal is faculty at ahmedabad university the views expressed here are his own
mass protests and a general strike against growing poverty corruption and demanding the resignation of president jovenel moïse have shut down haiti for the past two weeks this mass movement is a direct continuation of the general strike that erupted last summer against proposed increases to the cost of fuel as well as the mass protests that took place last november in relation to a corruption scandal involving petrocaribe funds petrocaribe corruption the petrocaribe alliance was launched in 2005 by the chavez government and would eventually include 17 countries in central america and the caribbean at a time when oil was selling for over 100 per barrel the petrocaribe programme provided cheap oil and preferential credit terms to member nations these could obtain oil at a fraction of the market price and pay the remainder over 25 years at very low interest haiti joined petrocaribe in 2006 when préval came to power much to the irritation of the imperialists without access to petrocaribe the haitian government would have found itself in a very difficult situation as the high price of fuel would have gutted government coffers following the 2010 earthquake venezuela not only forgave 295 million in debt that haiti had accrued since joining petrocaribe but also provided funds for reconstruction and aid these acts of solidarity on the part of the venezuelan government were deeply appreciated by the people of haiti the petrocaribe fund providing cheap oil from venezuela has been plundered by haiti s elite image medyalokal haiti has accumulated some 2 billion more in debt to venezuela under petrocaribe since then the idea behind petrocaribe was that savings from the programme were supposed to be used for development and infrastructure investment primarily into housing healthcare and education after many years there has been no development and the haitian people saw none of the social benefits expected from petrocaribe people naturally began to wonder where all the money had gone the haitian senate released reports in 2016 and 2017 indicating that nearly 2 billion from the petrocaribe fund had been stolen by haiti s political elite the reports showed that there were some 1 7 billion worth of no bid contracts handed out by the government between 2008 and 2016 these projects were paid for using petrocaribe money but were never completed the senate reports and a january 2019 report from the superior court of auditors highlighted the disastrous management and embezzlement of petrocaribe funds some 15 former ministers and senior officials of former president martelly s government have been implicated including the current president moïse himself a company owned by moïses at the time was paid to construct a road but a contract for the project cannot be found the january report itself was incomplete and was unable to finish the investigation into the theft of petrocaribe funds a follow up report is expected in april predictably despite the flagrant theft of petrocaribe funds no charges have been made and there have been no arrests spurred by a social media campaign called the petrocaribe challenge a series of protests were held last year against the theft of petrocaribe funds and the widespread corruption in the country this movement culminated in mass protests and strikes that shut down port au prince several times late last year with demonstrators demanding the resignation of the government and justice with regard to corruption and the theft of petrocaribe funds the end of petrocaribe haiti s economic situation continues to deteriorate the foreign aid that flowed into the country following the earthquake in 2010 and the hurricanes that followed has essentially dried up it also seems that a lot of this money was also stolen by haiti s elites haiti was already behind on payments to venezuela under the petrocaribe agreement however with us pressure on venezuela growing in the form of sanctions haiti found itself unable to make repayments on its debts and haiti s involvement in petrocaribe effectively ended in october 2017 venezuela now cannot provide subsidised fuel to haiti because of the sanctions the reality is that haiti s fuel subsidy which most haitians rely on to survive could only be maintained because of petrocaribe with the petrocaribe option closed the haitian government turned to the imf which saw an opportunity and tried to force the haitian government to get rid of the fuel subsidy the imf has offered millions in loans in exchange for privatisations and the elimination of the fuel subsidy the imf argued that because of the theft and embezzlement of petrocaribe funds the fuel subsidy had to be cancelled as it was disproportionately benefitting haiti s elites this could only enrage the haitian people not only had the haitian ruling class flagrantly stolen petrocaribe funds intended for social development to benefit the poor now the people were expected to pay for it too the reality of the situation is that most working class and poor haitians cannot survive without these subsidies the proposed cancellation of the subsidy led to an explosion of anger amongst the haitian people resulting in several days of mass protests and strikes in july 2018 and the resignation of the prime minister not only has the haitian ruling class flagrantly stolen petrocaribe funds intended for social development to benefit the poor the people are expected to pay for it image jean nehemy pierre now that venezuela cannot provide subsidised fuel haiti has had to turn to us oil companies and pay us prices for fuel which it cannot afford this has led to a fuel shortage the shortage is such that there are long lines at gas stations and it also means that people cannot afford fuel for cooking or lighting and electricity haitian telecom companies don t have enough fuel to keep their cell phone towers operational and utility companies cannot provide power because electrical output has been slashed to deal with the fuel shortage many areas of the country now have only six hours of power per day while others have none scandalously fuel is in fact being delivered to haiti there are currently tankers loaded with fuel owned by us energy companies sitting in the port au prince harbour but the haitian government is cash strapped and in arrears to these companies who refuse to deliver the fuel until the debts are paid and payment is received in full in us dollars having lost access to cheap oil on credit haiti s budget deficit is spiralling out of control which has devalued the national currency against the us dollar the inflation rate has been around 15 percent over the past couple years increasing the costs of basic goods and putting things such as fuel food and transport out of the reach of most haitian people one man on a demonstration told the press that we can no longer stand this economic stagnation we have no electricity no security and now the sellers of flour and bread have decided to close their doors due to inflation so now we are approaching a situation of hunger riots again a woman explained that when i was little one hundred gourdes allowed us to eat until our stomachs were full now we cannot even buy coal to cook food adding that with martelly it was better with préval before him we had enough food to eat and under aristide my children were going to school capturing the mood of the people another demonstrator explained that it s been two years since promised to fill our plates but i cannot eat lies solidarity with the bolivarian revolution the last straw came on 10 january of this year when at a vote of the organization of american states oas haiti sided with the united states on a motion stating that the government of nicolas maduro was illegitimate there is a direct link and a real bond of solidarity between the bolivarian revolution in venezuela and the developments in the haitian revolution image public domain this was too much for the people of haiti in the eyes of the haitian working class and poor venezuela is the country that has supported and helped haiti the most through the lending of aid provision of funds for infrastructure projects access to cheap oil and the writing off of debts etc the revolutionary solidarity between the people of haiti and venezuela is real and tangible and not easily forgotten by the people the one country that had supported and helped haiti was now being betrayed by the political elites after they had lined their pockets by stealing petrocaribe funds there is a direct link between the bolivarian revolution in venezuela and the developments in the haitian revolution when cancelling haiti s petrocaribe debt after the 2010 earthquake chavez himself explained that haiti had no debt with venezuela explaining that it was in fact the other way around and venezuela owed a historic debt to haiti chavez undoubtedly had in mind the inspiration drawn from the haitian revolution of 1791 and independence of 1804 but also the sanctuary and support provided by the republic of haiti for simon bolivar in 1815 moreover the revolutionary movement in haiti that saw the overthrow of the duvalier regime and the eventual electoral victory of aristide in the early 1990s was an inspiration to chavez and the bolivarian revolution in venezuela the bolivarian revolution in turn became a major inspiration to the people of haiti in their struggle for freedom from capitalism and imperialist occupation venezuela and haiti were definitely linked in the minds of us imperialism fearing the danger of a revolutionary tide sweeping the whole region the imperialists targeted aristide along with chavez for removal from power in fact the tactics used in haiti to remove aristide from power in 2004 are remarkably similar to those attempted in venezuela to remove chavez and now maduro including direct coup d états bosses lockouts electoral boycotts and the fostering of a democratic opposition etc the masses rise after the oas vote on 10 january calls went out for rallies and demonstrations in solidarity with venezuela and the bolivarian revolution as the movement began to grow calls went out for a massive demonstration on 7 february the date of this demonstration was significant as it marks the flight of duvalier from haiti in 1986 and the inauguration of aristide in 1991 on 7 february haiti was shut down by mass protests and strikes centered on three demands 1 the immediate resignation of president jovenel moïse the main ally of the united states in haiti 2 proper criminal proceedings against the haitian political class for the embezzlement of 3 8 billion dollars from the public treasury and 3 support for the government of nicolas maduro and the rejection of north american interference in the affairs of the region the movement continued to grow and gain momentum over the next two weeks schools banks embassies businesses and fuel stations all remained closed roadblocks went up across the country disrupting transit and effectively shutting down airports moïse was silent until 15 february when in a public address he refused to resign and rejected the demands of the opposition he apparently wants to use the national police to drown demonstrations in blood and crush the opposition but there have also been reports that the police forces have been destabilised and that the protests have created massive contradictions in the police there are concerns on the part of the haitian ruling class and the imperialists that the police are in fact unreliable clashes with police have led to multiple injuries and deaths and there have been reports of severe police repression against demonstrators in some areas also including the involvement of un troops but the mass protests and strikes continued unabated until earlier this week with most services shut down for almost two weeks there was a lull in the movement earlier this week as people took time to collect food and water search for fuel and other necessities and clean neighbourhoods there have been no sanitation or garbage removal services for weeks the situation remains very fluid after the lull earlier this week the opposition has called for a continuation of the demonstrations on friday 22 february with one opposition leader saying on friday we will march across the country to get jovenel moïse out of the national palace the time for dialogue has passed and the government has nothing to offer the government s policies are promises that it will never be able to implement the government will come under enormous pressure from the imperialists to resolve the situation the moïse government is incredibly weak with no mandate or popular support now faced with mass protests and general strikes the popular revolt of the haitian masses could very well topple the government haiti haiti s economic lifeline has taken a hit expedia just made it worse pic twitter com uqjiqf9wft haiti now ayiti now corp haitinoworg february 19 2019 with no access to funds or fuel the haitian government has no real means of buying any temporary social peace they have no economic means at their disposal to appease the masses nor do they have any political capital to appease the political demands of the movement with the national police force reportedly wavering the government will find it very difficult to repress the movement with physical force this doesn t mean that the police cannot and will not attack demonstrations and striking workers but given the balance of forces it seems unlikely that the government could defeat the movement with police action alone there has been some talk of us imperialism sending humanitarian aid by which they of course mean an operation and coup similar to what they are now attempting in venezuela with no real means of dealing with the crisis the haitian ruling class will be very dependent on imperialism to solve the crisis this then opens up the possibility of some sort of coup supported by un troops or imperialist forces delivering humanitarian aid by demanding the resignation of the president proper investigation of the petrocaribe theft and punishment for those involved and by challenging the government s foreign policy in relation to the bolivarian revolution the haitian people have directly posed the question of who rules in haitian society it is very likely that the government could fall within the coming days or weeks in that event the question will then be what replaces the fallen government the haitian ruling class is powerless and the haitian people cannot and will not trust in any solution offered by the imperialists a deal brokered with us imperialism or the un would only mean the continued occupation of the country by foreign troops another temporary and ineffective political solution and the continuation of the same policies of humiliation poverty and starvation the movement of the haitian masses must reject any deals with the ruling haitian elite the imperialists and must demand the removal of all un and foreign troops the working and poor masses of haiti can only rely on themselves to resolve the situation and must take power themselves with the movement now entering its third week extended strike committees should be established and linked up in all districts cities and regions to coordinate political activity and strike actions these committees should then also begin to coordinate all the activities the government is no longer able to perform with the economy in ruins the strike committees should begin organising the collection and distribution of basic goods such as food water and fuel and organise transportation education sanitation and healthcare sources of fuel food and water should be expropriated and distribution organised by the strike committees only a government of the workers farmers and poor of haiti will be able to resolve the current crisis only socialism offers a way forward for the people of haiti the only way to permanently stop the economic chaos end the crushing poverty and develop the economy and provide jobs is to remove the rotten haitian elite and the imperialists from power the people of haiti are not alone in their struggle the current movement was sparked by the betrayal of the bolivarian revolution by the haitian ruling elite there is a deep sense of solidarity among the working class and poor across the caribbean and latin america the solidarity demonstrated by the haitian people for the workers and poor of venezuela will in turn not be forgotten they struggle in common against a common enemy by pressing their own revolution forward and striking a decisive blow against imperialism the haitian masses can come to the aid of the venezuelan revolution as in past centuries the haitian revolution today could be the spark and source of inspiration for a mighty wave of revolutionary struggle across the whole of the americas and the world

the liberalisation of the united states dollar exchange rate against real time gross settlement rtgs balances bond notes and all currencies in the multi currency basket will not only formalise trade in foreign currency but kill the black market trade in forex while stabilising the economy in the long term having listened to cries from industry and other stakeholders in the economy the reserve bank of zimbabwe has obliged by bringing sanity to the foreign currency market which was causing massive distortions in the economy through promoting inflation and wanton price hikes the eagerly awaited 2019 monetary policy statement delivered by rbz governor dr john mangudya on wednesday was a masterstroke in that it ring fenced rtgs balances while promoting exports boosting diaspora remittances and investments and eliminating multi tier pricing it also denominated existing rtgs balances bond notes and coins in circulation as rtgs dollars to establish an exchange between current monetary balances and foreign currency by establishing an interbank market the rbz has dealt a body blow to the parallel market as forex trade will now be conducted through banks and registered bureau de change on a willing buyer willing seller basis crucially the interbank market unshackles manufacturers particularly those on the rbz priority list to source foreign currency on the formal market and boost production the cost of production will also come down as industry will now be accessing forex from a stable reliable and legal source this has the effect of reducing imports and lowering prices of goods on the local market the interbank market will provide a platform for holders of foreign currency to trade legally with those who need it in industry increasing production capacity utilisation and creating employment it will also choke the black market whose rates will gradually decline until it eventually collapses over time given the lack of foreign currency on the market the rbz should be applauded for committing to kick start the interbank market by providing foreign currency to banks as seed capital so that they manage and stabilise the foreign exchange rate what is critical is that imports of electricity medicine and fuel will still be done through the rbz meaning that the prices will remain at current levels hence there will be no volatility in the economy zimbabweans will be relieved that the rbz has denominated the existing rtgs balances other electronic money bond notes and coins in circulation as rtgs dollars to establish an exchange rate between current balances and foreign currencies this means that the value of their money has been preserved and will not be hostage to the whims of the parallel market which was largely volatile by eliminating the multi pricing system and pricing of goods in foreign currency the rbz is protecting ordinary zimbabweans who were being ripped off by greedy businesses which were now profiteering on a grand scale taking advantage of the chaos in the market the rtgs dollar will bring calm and order to the market with prices of goods and services expected to decline or stabilise in the short to medium term to get the us dollar equivalent of current rtgs balances dr mangudya said the prevailing determined exchange rate will apply the us bond rate currently hovers around 1 3 5 4 this will bring fairness and transparency in the distribution of foreign currency dr mangudya said adding that the policy measures were intended to formalise what was already happening on the parallel market which the bank had no control over to anchor exchange rate stability dr mangudya said the rbz would aggressively intervene in the market to sterilise liquidity so as to help contain inflationary and exchange rate pressures zimbabwe has 1 8 billion usable rtgs balances out of a total of about 10 billion the remainder is tied up in treasury bills rbz savings bonds and loans to public sector and private borrowers we welcome the interventions by the rbz and are confident that they will stabilise the economy and assist in ensuring the successful implementation of the transitional stabilisation programme it was critical that the monetary policy statement augmented measures enunciated by the minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube when he presented the 2019 budget which are anchored on austerity cost cutting and allocation of resources to critical productive sectors of the economy foreign investors and multi lateral financial institutions will also have been charmed by the deference to market forces in management of the exchange rate this inspires confidence in the markets and shows zimbabwe s determination to implement far reaching reforms to turnaround the economy it was prudent that zimbabwe moves away from the current monetary arrangements as they were pushing the country towards re dollarisation a disaster for a small economy as that might spell a recession exporters who bring in most of the country s foreign currency and whose incentives were being eroded by forex premiums induced inflationary pressures will also be happy with the increased foreign currency retention thresholds

implemented the reverse split and our shares began trading on each of nasdaq and the tsx on a post split basis under our existing trade symbol ipci at the market open on september 14 2018 the reverse split reduced the number of outstanding common shares from approximately 43 5 million to approximately 4 35 million at that time in september 2018 we announced that we issued in a private placement

respect of our nda filing for oxycodone er the parties to the case mutually agreed to and did have dismissed without prejudice the infringement claims related to the grünenthal 060 patent which is one

approximately 1 6 million we also issued to the placement agents warrants to purchase 15 000 common shares at an exercise price of 7 50 per share in february 2018 we met with the fda to discuss a previously announced complete response letter crl for oxycodone er including issues related to the blue dye in the product candidate based on those discussions the product candidate will no longer include the blue dye the blue dye was intended to act as an additional deterrent if oxycodone er is abused and serve as an early warning mechanism to flag potential misuse or abuse the fda confirmed that the removal of the blue dye is unlikely to have any impact on formulation quality and performance as a result we will not be required to repeat in vivo bioequivalence studies and pharmacokinetic studies submitted in the oxycodone er new drug applications ndas the fda also indicated that from an abuse liability perspective category 1 studies will not have to be repeated on oxycodone er with the blue dye removed results of operations the company recorded net loss for the year ended november 30 2018 of 13 8 million or 2 89 per common share compared with a net loss of 8 9 million or 2 86 per common share for the year ended november 30 2017 in the year ended november 30 2018 the higher net loss is attributed to the lower licensing revenues from commercial sales of generic focalin xr and lower licensing revenues from quetiapine er our generic seroquel xr quetiapine fumarate extended release combined with increased third party r d expenses primarily related to clinical trials for the company s oxycodone er product legal and other administrative expenses in the year ended november 30 2017 the net loss was attributed to the ongoing r d and selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by licensing revenues from commercial sales of generic focalin xr and to a lesser extent sales of generic seroquel xr shipped to mallinckrodt the company recorded revenues of 1 7 million for the year ended november 30 2018 versus 5 5 million for the year ended november 30 2017 such revenues consisted primarily of licensing revenues from commercial sales of the 15 25 30 and 35 mg strengths of our generic focalin xr under the par agreement the decrease in revenues in the year ended november 30 2018 compared to year ended november 30 2017 is primarily due to considerably lower profit share payments from sales of generic focalin xr capsules in the u s beginning in early 2018 we began to see significant impact from aggressive pricing by competitors resulting in a marked increase in gross to net deductions such as wholesaler rebates chargebacks and pricing adjustments while the gross to net deductions fluctuate on a quarter over quarter basis profit share payments for the last several quarters have shown decline over the same period in the prior year revenues from generic seroquel xr are still well below levels expected at the launch of the product in 2017 primarily due to the company s commercial partner entering the market later than planned several initiatives to gain market share have shown some improved returns however it is expected to take some time to determine if the product can achieve meaningful market penetration management is continuing to evaluate strategic options to improve returns from this product expenditures for r d for the year ended november 30 2018 were higher by 1 6 million compared to the year ended november 30 2017 the increase is primarily due to higher third party consulting fees and higher patent litigation expenses after adjusting for the stock based compensation expenses expenditures for r d for the year ended november 30 2018 were higher by 2 3 million compared to the year ended november 30 2017 the increase was primarily due to an increase in third party r d expenditures as a result of clinical trials for oxycodone er and higher patent litigation expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 3 5 million for the year ended november 30 2018 in comparison to 3 3 million for the year ended november 30 2017 an increase of 0 2 the increase is due to higher expenses related to administrative costs partially offset by a decrease in wages and marketing cost the company had cash of 6 6 million as at november 30 2018 compared to 1 9 million as at november 30 2017 the increase in cash was mainly due to the cash receipts provided from financing activities derived from the company s two registered direct offering in march 2018 the 2018 debenture financing in september 2018 and an underwritten public offering in october 2018 offset by ongoing expenditures in r d and selling general and administrative expenses as of february 22 2019 our cash balance was 3 0 million we currently expect to satisfy our operating cash requirements until may 2019 from cash on hand and quarterly profit share payments from par and mallinckrodt the company will need to obtain additional funding as we further the development of our product candidates potential sources of capital may include payments from licensing agreements cost savings associated with managing operating expense levels equity and or debt financings and or new strategic partnership agreements which fund some or all costs of product development we intend to utilize the equity markets to bridge any funding shortfall and to provide capital to continue to advance our most promising product candidates our future operations are highly dependent upon our ability to source additional capital to support advancing our product

the vietnam war fought over 20 years to 1975 devastated the country leaving 4 million vietnamese dead it has taken the country decades to rebuild itself with plenty of bumps along the way hard lessons were learnt from the overheating of vietnam s economy in the late 2000s says brook tellwright manager of the waverton southeast asian fund since then though the macro economic and monetary policy management have been much better managed vietnam s economy today is one of the fastest growing and most vibrant in the world gdp grew at 7 in 2018 with similar growth forecast for 2019 some investors question the accuracy of this data but sat duhra co manager of henderson far east income hfel says most of the companies he meets are growing at around 30 40 you can therefore believe that unlike india this economy is genuinely growing at about 7 he says demographics are extremely favourable too around two thirds of vietnamese are under the age of 35 a product of the baby boomer generation that were born in the aftermath of the war around half the population is of working age wages are on a steep upward curve but are still low enough labour costs are around a third that of china to tempt foreign institutions to the country once they come to vietnam they get addicted to the drug and the drug s called cheap labour says andy ho chief investment officer at vinacapital the next emerging market vietnam gets foreign direct investment fdi disbursements of around 15 million per year samsung for example makes most of its smartphones in vietnam while intel s largest factory outside the us is in vietnam as trade tariffs continue to bite chinese firms are increasingly looking to re locate to their closest neighbour too it s not reliant on china though which is positive the three biggest contributors to fdi are korea japan and singapore emily fletcher co manager of blackrock frontiers brfi argues that it is this fdi and the export growth it brings with it that is driving vietnam s economy as long as fdi continues to grow she adds so will vietnam s economy its geography is very good as well says robert horrocks chief investment officer at matthews asia the coastline has lots of deep water ports that can link it up by sea to the global financial system by rail and expressways to the rest of se asia and into china and obviously by air the reforms the communist government has overseen in vietnam are impressive as opposed to most world regions its politics are incredibly stable inflation is low at around 3 and the currency is stable as well that s a product of the country s vast trade surplus particularly with the us further while it borrows 65 of gdp it mainly borrows from local investors rather than the us as a result the vietnamese dong depreciated just 2 in 2018 the economy is just in great shape says bill stoops chief investment officer at dragon capital if you compare it with most of its emerging market peers you d have to say it s almost the best economy out there despite that final comment vietnam is still categorised by msci as a frontier market true it should be the next country to step up to emerging status but the ascension won t start until mid 2019 at the earliest once that process has begun it will take a couple of years to finalise the changes seen in vietnam s economy can be summed up in its food production evolution not much more than a decade ago explains ho vietnam imported almost all the food its citizens consumed today vietnam is in the top two exporters of rice and coffee and exports a lot of seafood worldwide mainly to china and hong kong synergies gained for consumers through businesses meanwhile can be exampled in travel the london listed vinacapital vietnam opportunity fund vof invests in vietjet the leading airline in vietnam previously it took two days and cost 150 to get from the north of the country to the south now a vietjet flight still costs 150 but takes just two hours to me they re not selling a ticket they re selling time says ho they re not undercutting anyone but they re giving you 34 hours of your life back hurdles to overcome before emerging status the stock market is growing fast too it has an extremely high market cap to gdp ratio and good daily trading volume says stoops duhra meanwhile notes that billions of dollars were raised through rights issues ipos and other capital market activity in 2018 further in the next two years the government wants to privatise 400 state owned enterprises this should make it a more liquid market inclusion in the msci emerging markets index would lead to significant inflows from etfs into the market also given these positive sentiments allocating a portion of an investors portfolio towards vietnam must be a no brainer there are worries though a potential slowdown in global exports is one the challenge for vietnam is what the outside world is going to throw at it says stoops we don t yet know how these complications of trade wars is going to affect the economy indeed vietnam has the fourth largest trade deficit with the united states although most think it s too small a fish to bother us president donald trump if he tried to place tariffs on vietnamese exports he would likely have a very angry ceo of intel for instance banging on the white house door notes horrocks another hurdle it needs to overcome especially before it can even be considered for an emerging market upgrade is its limits on foreign ownership many of the more investible companies in vietnam are currently at their limits with regards foreign ownership this is one of the few structural problems that exit in vietnam explains tellwright adding that even registering as a foreign investor in vietnam is a laborious process while these limits can be lifted at any point fletcher thinks the country feels as though doing so would amount to giving up their sovereignty it think that makes it a politically difficult one to overcome as a result of this foreigners looking to invest in many of the larger companies have to purchase stock from fellow foreigners notes duhra this tends to come at a meaty premium as a result his fund which is co run by mike kerley invests in vinacapital vietnam opportunity a s a foreigner buying some of these individual shares you can pay up to a 20 premium for it yet you can buy the closed end investment trust at a 20 discount and with a 3 yield kerley explains investment opportunities the vn index was one of the strongest performers in 2017 with its 48 rise more than double that of the msci world last year was tougher and its near 10 decline was worse than the broader index though less than msci em at almost 15 that s left a lot of stocks that we re interested in and that are on our watchlist looking very attractively valued says tellwright the market adds stoops is currently trading on around 12 times earnings for 10 6 earnings growth this year a price earnings to growth ratio of 1 1 times makes it very cheap versus its peers the vinacapital fund is differentiated due to its focus on private unlisted companies it invests in hospitals schools banks and food firms with the target of helping them grow and ultimately listing them on the stock market or exiting through an acquisition from an investment perspective the same themes crop up with its favourable demographics and rising wages comes an emerging middle class which are now moving from their rural homes to big cities once they get there they need to buy things says ho you need to buy food and beverages a home clothes a motorbike you need to have healthcare banking services all these are basic needs and we like to invest in sectors that provide those needs stoops agrees and one of the largest holdings in his vietnam enterprise investments veil fund is mobile world one of the biggest retailers in the country it mainly sells electronic equipment but is looking to branch out onto supermarkets he also has a big weighting in banks with asia commercial bank and military bank top 10 holdings they both have great earnings growth of 20 this year a return on equity of 25 and trade on 1 4 times price book if they

blue dye was intended to act as an additional deterrent if oxycodone er is abused and serve as an early warning mechanism to flag potential misuse or abuse the fda confirmed that the removal of the blue dye is unlikely to have any impact on formulation quality and performance as a result we will not be required to repeat in vivo bioequivalence studies and pharmacokinetic studies submitted in the oxycodone er new drug applications ndas the fda also indicated that from an abuse liability perspective category 1 studies will not have to be repeated on oxycodone er with the blue dye removed results of operations the company recorded net loss for the year ended november 30 2018 of 13 8 million or 2 89 per common share compared with a net loss of 8 9 million or 2 86 per common share for the year ended november 30 2017 in the year ended november 30 2018 the higher net loss is attributed to the lower licensing revenues from commercial sales of generic focalin xr and lower licensing revenues from quetiapine er our generic seroquel xr quetiapine fumarate extended release combined with increased third party r d expenses primarily related to clinical trials for the company s oxycodone er product legal and other administrative expenses in the year ended november 30 2017 the net loss was attributed to the ongoing r d and selling general and administrative expenses partially offset by licensing revenues from commercial sales of generic focalin xr and to a lesser extent sales of generic seroquel xr shipped to mallinckrodt the company recorded revenues of 1 7 million for the year ended november 30 2018 versus 5 5 million for the year ended november 30 2017 such revenues consisted primarily of licensing revenues from commercial sales of the 15 25 30 and 35 mg strengths of our generic focalin xr under the par agreement the decrease in revenues in the year ended november 30 2018 compared to year ended november 30 2017 is primarily due to considerably lower profit share payments from sales of generic focalin xr capsules in the u s beginning in early 2018 we began to see significant impact from aggressive pricing by competitors resulting in a marked increase in gross to net deductions such as wholesaler rebates chargebacks and pricing adjustments while the gross to net deductions fluctuate on a quarter over quarter basis profit share payments for the last several quarters have shown decline over the same period in the prior year revenues from generic seroquel xr are still well below levels expected at the launch of the product in 2017 primarily due to the company s commercial partner entering the market later than planned several initiatives to gain market share have shown some improved returns however it is expected to take some time to determine if the product can achieve meaningful market penetration management is continuing to evaluate strategic options to improve returns from this product expenditures for r d for the year ended november 30 2018 were higher by 1 6 million compared to the year ended november 30 2017 the increase is primarily due to higher third party consulting fees and higher patent litigation expenses after adjusting for the stock based compensation expenses expenditures for r d for the year ended november 30 2018 were higher by 2 3 million compared to the year ended november 30 2017 the increase was primarily due to an increase in third party r d expenditures as a result of clinical trials for oxycodone er and higher patent litigation expenses selling general and administrative expenses were 3 5 million for the year ended november 30 2018 in comparison to 3 3 million for the year ended november 30 2017 an increase of 0 2 the increase is due to higher expenses related to administrative costs partially offset by a decrease in wages and marketing cost the company had cash of 6 6 million as at november 30 2018 compared to 1 9 million as at november 30 2017 the increase in cash was mainly due to the cash receipts provided from financing activities derived from the company s two registered direct offering in march 2018 the 2018 debenture financing in september 2018 and an underwritten public offering in october 2018 offset by ongoing expenditures in r d and selling general and administrative expenses as of february 22 2019 our cash balance was 3 0 million we currently expect to satisfy our operating cash requirements until may 2019 from cash on hand and quarterly profit share payments from par and mallinckrodt the company will need to obtain additional funding as we further the development of our product candidates potential sources of capital may include payments from licensing agreements cost savings associated with managing operating expense levels equity and or debt financings and or new strategic partnership agreements which fund some or all costs of product development we intend to utilize the equity markets to bridge any funding shortfall and to provide capital to continue to advance our most promising product candidates our future operations are highly dependent upon our ability to source additional capital to support advancing our product pipeline

jeffrey eckel the company s president and ceo and brendan herron our cfo with that i ll turn the call over to jeff who ll begin on slide 3 jeff jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thanks amanda and good afternoon today we are announcing that we grew gaap earnings 32 year over year to 0 75 core earnings are up 9 year over year to 1 38 above the high end of our 2018 guidance given our accretive additions to the balance sheet and a strong pipeline we reiterate our guidance for 2019 and 2020 of 2 to 6 growth in core earnings from the 2017 base we also announced a 2 increase in the quarterly dividend to an annualized 1 34 per share as previously discussed we intend to grow the dividend but slower than the core earnings growth rate we closed a record 1 2 billion of transactions for the year with balance sheet transactions around the same level as 2017 and securitizations up compared to 2017 the combination of higher portfolio yields from the balance sheet investments and higher securitizations in 2018 allowed us to increase our core return on equity above 11 our pipeline remained strong at more than 2 5 billion especially in behind the meter assets in q4 we renegotiated our primary credit facility at lower rates and extended the maturity both good things 0 5 million metric tons of co2 will be reduced annually from our 2018 investments a carboncount score of 0 42 the business is in great shape and as our business has grown our need for talent has grown this is the perfect time to be making a transition brendan has done an outstanding job as our chief financial officer including coming up with the idea and strategy for taking the company public in 2013 effective march 1 brendan will assume a new leadership role focusing on strategy and our growth initiatives this is not an exit for brendan but a new role to use his considerable business skills and acumen to help us capture the very large climate finance opportunity in front of us we are seeing increasing ways to partner with leading companies to meet their growth objectives such as the previously announced sunstrong and hannon armstrong sustainable real estate collaborations brendan will have a leadership role in making sure these and our other initiatives are successful we welcome jeff lipson a 30 year corporate finance and banking veteran who joined us last month and will become cfo effective march 1 jeff will take over leadership of our finance and accounting teams as we look to continue to grow the business you ll be hearing from jeff later in the presentation and i look forward to introducing him in person when we hit the road for investor meetings turning to slide 4 we d like to address some of the key questions that are top of mind for our investors the market opportunity continues to grow and evolve in the 10 or so niche markets we invest in we are continuing to see better risk adjusted returns in assets that are behind the meter as opposed to grid connected assets this further reinforces the overarching themes we ve discussed before the three ds of the future electric power system decentralization digitalization and decarbonization this evolution is happening faster than we expected the competitive landscape remains largely the same in our various niche markets and we continue to believe if we stay committed to long term programmatic client relationships these relationships will continue to work as they did in 2018 on the pg e question we do not see any significant exposure to the pg e bankruptcy we own land under number of grid connected solar projects selling power to pg e where our rents are current we enjoy substantial asset and rent coverages and are well collateralized by assets and cash flow even if the ppas are rejected in bankruptcy and the project is selling to the merchant market as we have said for several quarters we like our position in the capital stack in these utility scale solar plants senior to all other capital providers while we like being senior in grid connected transactions given the relatively low equity returns and higher perceived risks we have increased our equity and mezzanine exposures in behind the meter assets including residential solar we ve always said we would make equity investments if we thought we were getting paid for the risk and we believe we are with our increased exposure to resi solar we ve managed about one third of the assets for almost five years giving us an informed view of the relative risk and believe we are getting paid appropriately for this diversified portfolio the yield curve continues to flatten and although we might prefer a normal upward sloping yield curve and correspondingly higher long term rates we ve demonstrated our business model is profitable in all interest rate environments including this flat yield curve environment we had limited impact from the recent government shutdown there were some payment delays inaudible approximately 30 of the agency shutdown but we ve always collected and expect a 100 collections this time as well to conclude on this page the green new deal has gotten people talking more about climate change which is a very good thing in our view while our business model will continue to prosper in virtually any public policy setting we continue to believe the carbon tax and dividend plan is the most impactful and economically efficient public policy approach turning to slide 5 we ve laid out our pipeline portfolio and credit profile the continued growth in the behind the meter portfolio is driving portfolio additions in earnings of the more than 2 5 billion pipeline about 75 is behind the meter efficiency solar and storage whether it s in a government building commercial business or residential property the 2 billion portfolio yield is up this quarter to 6 8 because of some of the balance sheet additions which i will review in a minute as well as the disposition of some lower yielding assets the assets remain diversified with respect to asset vendor and obligor concentrations finally on portfolio credit quality we have rated the increased exposure to some of these newer assets like resi solar and environmental restoration as non investment grade which increases the non investment grade category to 15 from 6 last quarter we will discuss this increase in more detail on the next slide in summary we continue to have less than 1 of the portfolio on non accrual status turning to page 6 we profile the three types of investments we made in non investment grade or equity transactions in the portfolio in q3 and q4 on the left side of the page our residential solar portfolio is approximately 300 million at year end with three of the top sponsors in the industry approximately 270 million of the investments are in a mezzanine structure with a balance of 30 million classified as equity as i mentioned at the outset we ve managed about a third of these assets for almost five years the transactions we completed shift this deeper in the capital stack and we believe improve our relative risk adjusted returns as a note the portfolio consist of 90 000 homeowners with attractive average fico scores of 750 the center of the page profiles an equity investment we made with one of the leading commercial and industrial solar sponsors this investment gives us a programmatic platform to expand this business more rapidly than we ve been able to do in the past finally the right hand side of the page profiles a four state wetlands mitigation and stream restoration investment we made in q4 similar to our q3 stormwater remediation investment we do expect more investments like these in the future all of these transactions were added to our balance sheet thus positioning us well at the start of 2019 for recurring revenues turning to slide 7 we d like to walk through how our record investment activity improves both 2018 roe and future year portfolio returns top left we show our growing programmatic client base that in part generated the 1 2 billion of investment activity while some of these assets are a great fit for our balance sheet as we just discussed others are not and are best securitized either way from our clients perspective we are providing a reliable capital solution in 2018 we securitized about 60 and put 40 on the balance sheet this higher level of securitizations of approximately 700 million allowed us to generate fees from the growth in the 5 3 billion of managed assets these additional fees contributed to our 11 1 core return on equity which has continued an upward trend although we would remind you that our target with a normalized level of securitizations remains 10 and with 40 or approximately 5 billion going on the balance sheet with improved yields largely in the last third of 2018 we ve improved our ability to generate recurring revenues for 2019 and beyond and reduce the importance of securitizations to achieve our earnings growth i will now turn it over to brendan to detail our financial performance j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thanks jeff turning to slide 8 for the year total revenue grew by approximately 32 million or 31 as compared to 2017 the increase was the result of higher gain on sale and fee income of 15 million due to the increased securitization volume and higher yields on our portfolio in the fourth quarter approximately 300 million of residential solar assets and our related 250 million of debt was prepaid both revenues and interest expense were impacted by this transaction we recorded approximately 13 million of interest income related to this prepayment this was offset by approximately 9 million of expense recorded in interest expense related to the debt repayment total revenue grew by approximately 12 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year as a result of the 15th sorry total revenue for the year grew by approximately 12 million as compared to same period last year as a result of the 15 million increase in investments due to higher yields and the prepayment described above excuse me total revenue by the grew by approximately 12 million for the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year as a result of the 15 million increase in investment revenue due to the higher yields and the prepayment described above increased investment revenue was offset by 3 million lower gain on sale and fee income for the quarter interest expense grew to 77 million from 65 million last year as a result of the higher fixed rate debt and the prepayment described earlier we completed a series of transactions in the second half of the year which lowered our interest cost such as refinancing our primary credit facility reducing the level of our interest rate swaps and the 250 million debt repayment which reduced our leverage interest expense for the quarter increased by approximately 1 million as these changes offset a large portion of the debt prepayment cost comp and general administrative expenses increased by approximately 5 million for the quarter and approximately 9 million for the full year primarily due to an increase in the size of the company as well as an additional bonus accrual in the fourth quarter to reflect the performance of the company for the quarter and the full year income from equity method investments was largely consistent with the same period in 2017 the non cash income tax expense rose by approximately 1 million for the year and was largely flat for the quarter in total we have 42 million or 0 75 per share of gaap income for the year compared to 31 million or 0 57 per share in 2017 as a reminder the gaap income does not include the full effect of the cash we receive from our equity investments in 2018 we collected 115 million in cash from these equity investments as compared to gaap income on these investments of approximately 22 million since we have based since we ve based our investment on future cash flows discounted back to a present value we believe the cash we receive reflects both a return of capital and a return on the investment thus we make a core adjustment of approximately 19 million to recognize the return on our investment which year to date when added to our gaap 22 million income gives a total core return of 41 million and thus the other 74 million represents a return of capital it is important to note that the interest expense associated with the leverage on these investments is shown in the interest expense line above as required under gaap stock comp and other adjustments were largely consistent for the quarter and the year as compared to last year in total core earnings were 76 million for the year a 9 increase for the quarter core earnings were 21 million an increase of 0 06 per share just to know for modeling purposes we would expect comp and g a on a core basis to be consistent with the first three quarters of the year in 2019 turning to slide 9 i will provide more comments on how our balance sheet has changed this year as we position for further growth in the fourth quarter we redeployed the 50 million of equity from the approximately 300 million of residential solar asset and our related 250 million of debt that was prepaid we also deployed the approximately 105 million primary equity raise and approximately 65 million from the atm into new projects jeff described earlier as we have demonstrated we raise equity to take advantage of good investment opportunities we successfully refinanced our primary credit facility extending the maturity to 2023 the new credit facility has increased flexibility and should lower annual interest cost by approximately 1 million we also diversified our credit facility lending group from one lender to a total of six lenders we lowered the fixed rate debt to 74 or approximately the midpoint of our range as a result of the debt repayment increased use of the floating rate facility and a reduction in the level of interest rate swaps this lower level of fixed debt reflects the change in the fed s outlook for interest rates finally the repayment of the 250 million of debt plus the approximately 170 million in equity raises lowers leverage to 1 5 to 1 0 while we would expect some releveraging given our current and historic leverage we are clarifying our leverage target to be more of a cap by inserting up to before the 2 5 to 1 0 as compared to the old fixed target of 2 5 to 1 0 these changes are expected to reduce interest expense by approximately 2 million a quarter in 2019 and when combined with a higher yield on assets is expected to allow us to achieve our guidance targets with lower gain on sale fees our stock remains largely institutional owned with employees owning approximately 5 before i turn it over to jeff lipson i would like to say that i m looking forward to working with jeff and in turning my attention to growing the business throughout my career i ve been fortunate enough to help businesses grow in several emerging industries the market and the need to address climate change is enormous i m excited to be in my new role in focusing on how we can better address the opportunity i will now turn it over to jeff lipson to talk about what he will be focusing on jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thank you brendan allow me to begin by expressing my enthusiasm for joining hannon armstrong and i look forward to working with all of our analysts and investors i joined the company at a perfect time jeff eckel s leadership has resulted in a strong financial performance and pipeline and brendan s leadership has optimized the capital and liquidity structure of the company my focus will be on expanding upon these successes and working with my colleagues to build a scalable platform to facilitate further growth in earning assets and eps moving to slide 10 of the presentation we maintain a debt structure that is limited refinance risk as most of our managed assets are either securitized or funded with amortizing non recourse debt the 2019 non recourse maturities are being addressed as we are currently negotiating extensions and term takeout financing as previously disclosed we are also currently evaluating corporate unsecured debt as part of our liquidity platform we also anticipate continuing to utilize regular way and the at the market equity offering programs to address liquidity needs and we will be refreshing our shelf and the current atm up to 250 million around the filing of our 10 k the graph at the bottom of page 10 further reinforces the limited maturities over the next few years now i ll turn the call back over to jeff eckel jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president welcome aboard jeff lipson jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thank you jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president turning to slide 11 we want to highlight some of our environmental social and governance metrics and the progress we ve made in the year as we ve discussed our investment thesis is that in a world increasingly defined by carbon we will earn superior risk adjusted returns investing on the right side of the climate change line we have long operationalized the thesis by using carbon count which calculates the carbon reduce per 1 000 of investment this is under the theory that if carbon counts and capital is scarce we should seek to make the most impactful investments as part of our commitment to transparently reporting the e in esg we published an annual sustainability report card disclosing the carboncount of every investment we made in the year and which will show a 0 42 carboncount in 2018 representing avoided carbon emissions we have continued our industry leadership in tcfd disclosures by integrating much of the disclosure into the 10 k we will be filing in the next few days our corporate culture is reflective of our commitment to esg which will be detailed in our forthcoming esg report coming out in q2 one example of this culture was the initiative of one of our young people to organize a team to install solar panels on low income housing in d c our employees commitment to advancing these types of initiatives is inspiring and i am honored to work alongside them turning to slide 12 in closing we couldn t be more optimistic about our business we re investing in a large and growing market over the long term estimates indicate our addressable market is a multi trillion dollar one that s true however we estimate the current addressable opportunity for the next five years with assets we like possessing attractive risk adjusted returns and sponsored by a top tier client in a programmatic effort to be closer to 100 billion still substantial this lower addressable market estimate indicates that we are carefully navigating the large opportunity set to ensure we are getting the best risk adjusted returns in these complex markets our client base is dominated by top tier firms growing to capture the decentralized digitalized and decarbonized future of energy these firms are the key to any of our success in combating climate change and we are grateful for the opportunity to support them by sticking with our programmatic focus we will also benefit from additional operating leverage our assets are well diversified relatively granular yet similar in structure giving us an excellent portfolio to manage we continued to have one of the most experienced teams in the industry and with our staff additions in 2018 and 2019 including jeff lipson of course we have deepened and broadened our skill thank you for joining us today we ll now open the call up for a few questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instruction we ll go first to julien dumoulin smith of bank of america anny liang bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi this is anny ph actually filling in for julien so i guess my first question is just wanted to get a sense of your strategy for the business model looking forward how much in on balance sheet assets are you looking to hold onto versus securitizations specifically what s a good estimate for the targeted split for 2019 and then going forward after that more long term j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so this year we did about 60 of securitizations and about 40 on balance sheet we would expect that that would continue at that level or probably depending on the assets we see we may increase putting on balance sheet as we ve talked about in the past our model longer term and in normal rate environment would be to be at 70 30 on balance sheet but given the flat yield curve a lot of the assets we originate our best we best realize the value in those by securitizing them so given the environment we would expect to continue to have a fairly high level of securitization comparable to this year or maybe slightly inside of that anny liang bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks and second what s your growth strategy in terms of resi solar market and specifically on that how much of that 75 of behind the meter pipeline over the next year would you expect to include resi solar maybe any information on what market you re looking to get into there and then what kind of return profiles are you aiming for resi solar jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well you ve got quite a few questions into your second question the 75 behind the meter is dominated by energy efficiency our legacy market resi solar is relatively new it s growing you julien covers most of the companies that are out there and some of whom are our clients now we expect it to be an interesting pipeline we would say that we re not going to become a residential solar finance company we re going to continue to build a diversified portfolio on balance sheet we like the assets we ve got we like the pipeline we ve got but really the efficiency market is growing just as fast as the resi solar market i m not trying to answer all of your questions but we haven t we have disclosed some of the returns on the resi solar portfolio so i won t repeat those and we haven t disclosed it we can t talk about them anny liang bank of america merrill lynch analyst alright sounds good thank you jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll go next to mark strouse with jpmorgan mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst yes good afternoon thanks for taking our questions so just starting off brendan thank you very much for your help getting us up to speed and congrats on the new role and jeff we look forward to working with you so our first question j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thanks mark mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst i mean it sounds like the pipeline is still very well diversified but just in particular looking at the 4q strength and the beat versus your guidance on the eps level is there any particular in markets that led to that outperformance that you can call out jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well i think it was last quarter we used the phrase that we re hitting on all cylinders and it s like a 10 cylinder engine we ve got 10 niche markets it really does continue whether it s q3 q4 or q1 we don t have that we have no control over which some of them fires but in general one half of them are hitting things go well when it s closer to all 10 it s pretty good business beyond that it s a good time to have the position we have in behind the meter assets with the behind the meter clients that we have i think this is where the the market is going and frankly it s coming right toward us mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst okay that s helpful and then just a quick follow up so your originations in 2018 were a bit above your long term targets of about 1 billion or so but just how should we think about that in 2019 i know it s kind of hard to predict but at this point are you expecting kind of similar levels to 18 or should we be modeling closer to your longer term targets jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well yes as you ve hinted at the business model still stands at 1 billion i think it s reasonable to think that if we re hitting on all 10 cylinders there s a good chance it s more than that at the same this is not a point in the business cycle where we want to reach for marginal assets and we re going to continue to be careful about which ones we go forward so the market is good we would prefer to optimize on picking the best risk adjusted returns rather than going for growth sake mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst yes makes sense keep up the good work thank you very much jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thanks operator we ll now take a question from noah kaye with oppenheimer co noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst thanks very much good afternoon i ll echo the congratulations to brendan on the evolution of your role and welcome aboard jeff i guess we re going to have to start this ambiguating ph by specifying which jeff we re talking to jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thanks noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst eckel i guess given the focus on behind the meter actually i wanted to ask you about activity around microgrids you talked about some of the signature projects like parris island microgrid we ve seen hawaii begin the preceding to actually create a microgrids tariff it looks like california could follow we understand these are typically long cycle development projects but just wondering if you re seeing uptick in activity there yes just comment if you could comment on the market jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well the white house was in the news this morning for their new task force that s looking at resiliency issues with dod and certainly we continue to see dod continue to invest through espcs and effectively micro grids for resiliency and cost reductions i think all large campuses whether they are dod or not are probably thinking that way the best thing about these emerging trends is with our client base our clients are out there talking to the folks in hawaii and the us government and any of the other campuses and we may not hear about them but we have complete confidence that when those jobs go to execution time we re going to be in the mix for financing that so i think the kind of the conclusion on micro grids is if you have increasing increasingly violent storms having onsite generation is the only way you can ensure reliability so i guess the bad news is we re going to have worst storms the good news for hannon armstrong is that probably is positive for our future business noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst understood and then i guess just a question around your comments on capping your leverage really kind of seeing that 2 5 to 1 0 as a cap can you just elaborate on that a little bit in the context of how the portfolio is evolving you called out the increase in non investment grade exposure and how we kind of square this with the efforts of the company is making to look at the possibility of corporate debt j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president sure so couple of comments on that noah so first of all we ve never really hit the 2 5 to 1 0 we got the 2 4 to 1 0 but we never really hit the 2 5 to 1 0 so that was one comment the other comment and especially as you start to think about things like corporate debt and i ll take the transaction that was paid off this quarter we had 300 million of assets we had 250 million of debt so net equity was only 50 million so that when you look at that on a leverage basis that s pretty highly levered and if you just we re reporting the net equity number you d have a much lower leverage and enjoy the same if not a higher return so especially when you start to think about rating agencies and things it makes sense to kind of look at where you re levered and are you levered in the appropriate way and do the assets be kind of put on the balance sheet at a gross versus the net level noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst make sense thanks operator we ll now take a question from philip shen with roth capital partners philip shen roth capital partners analyst brendan congratulations as well and jeff looking forward to working with you back to resi solar jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thanks likewise philip shen roth capital partners analyst for a bit a follow up to anny s ph question earlier jeff eckel i know you had mentioned you guys do not want to become a resi solar finance company but when you look at these originators sunpower vivint sunrun et cetera they are installing meaningful megawatts every year can you maybe give us a little bit more color on what that line might be i think sunpower might be 300 megawatts this year vivint close to 200 megawatts and i think you mentioned that you are doing business with three resi solar companies but i believe you may have only announced two vivint and sunpower is it possible to talk about who that third one might be thanks jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thanks phil on your last point we always let our clients lead so whenever that third company chooses to disclose that that s when it will be public let me clarify one of your question when you said line what do you mean can you give us a view on the line you talked about sunpower and vivint but i m not sure what you re looking for philip shen roth capital partners analyst yes so there is a line between being not being a resi solar finance company and being one so how what is there a metric that you guys like at what point do you guys become too resi solar heavy and so how do you think about where that line might be on whatever metric you guys might use internally jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president that s a good question we clearly do not have a line that is quantitative i think we re very comfortable with where we are now we would probably be has ph to add significantly more at the same time a lot of these transactions ended up in the last third of the year we don t expect similar volumes in the first third of 2019 instead we ll see volumes in other markets we talked about wetlands and mitigation stream restoration those are coming on balance sheet we believe in the first third of the year c i solar so we kind of had a lump of resi solar at the end of the year and now it s time for us to add some other asset classes as we always expect to including pace assets philip shen roth capital partners analyst great thanks jeff one quick follow up on resi solar and forgive me but i m travelling two different earnings calls and i may have missed this in your prepared remarks but i recall the sunrun initial deal was a 100 plus million for mezzanine debt and then 10 million for equity and then now you guys are at inaudible mezzanine debt so incrementally is there 170 million more of the mezzanine debt and 20 million more of equity and can you just talk about who this might be with and apologies if you guys have already addressed this j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president yes so phil in the call we talked about 300 million we talked about we ve three other top sponsors and 270 million of it is classified as debt and 30 million is classified as equity we didn t give more detail but the fact that the transaction you re referring to is one of the three sponsors you can imagine that we did two other transactions that gave us the additional volume philip shen roth capital partners analyst okay thanks brendan and then lastly jeff you just mentioned c pace can you give us an update on how things stand there historically it s been it s still on the horizon is there some development to think that maybe in 2019 we could see some degree of acceleration in that end market jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president i would say it is still on the horizon but we are obviously talking about it we do think 2019 should be a pretty good year for c pace and we re very much we ve been investing in this platform those investments we think are starting to turn the corner and pay off so again we ll announce things when they re closed not before but we continue to think that s a sound market for us to invest in philip shen roth capital partners analyst great thanks jeff i ll pass it on operator we ll now take a question from christopher souther from cowen and company christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst hi welcome jeff and congrats on the new role brendan jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thanks chris christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst first question you just said that 60 40 split between securitization and balance sheet transactions given the industry environment inaudible kind of think of going forward as well but you also said you expected to hit the midpoint of guidance without kind of an elevated gain on sale are those gain on sale return thing pretty consistent just kind of curious that if you are keeping the 2020 range for eps despite kind of the strong 2018 when we get a sense of this is conservatism potential lumpiness or some other factor j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so i think to clarify that question a little bit chris we said the comment i made was we re going thought interest rate expense would decrease by about 8 million which would allow us to bring down gain on sale somewhat so i don t think we re talking that gain on sale as disappearing or anything but it s was 30 some million last year so it s going to go down from that number as we put more assets on the balance sheet and recognize more net interest income or net investment income off of those assets so i think it s a shifting or a sliding of the gain on sale versus a wholesale change the other point that you made is yes certain transactions are like anything else certain transactions the margins move around a little bit in total they are relative they ve been relatively consistent but they do move around a little bit depending on the transaction that we re securitizing jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president but we don t see any particular trend in securitization margins it s more of the mix in a quarter or in a year but if you take a much longer view it s pretty pretty much the same christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst okay that s helpful and then just kind of a to put the 300 million residential solar in context do you guys know how much of that was kind of new leases type thing as opposed to ones that were on the balance sheet of kind of these residential partners just to kind of get an idea of what the run rate is here i think might be helpful j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so i think the sunpower assets were disclosed they were the third of assets that we have had for roughly a third of the assets we ve had for five years that were refinanced and we just entered at a difference point in the capital stack i don t know that we re prepared to talk about it for the other two providers jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president but it fair to say two thirds are relatively new assets christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate you guys taking the questions jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll now take questions from carter driscoll with b riley fbr carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst mr herron who is going to explain hlbv to me anymore i m going to have j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president i m still around carter i can still do that service for you carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst thank you terrified me there for a moment no seriously so maybe could you explain maybe with little more color your role are you looking at exploring new types of financing alternatives as kind of the composition of your portfolio slightly ships and would that be with some newer partners just trying to get a little bit of additional detail on how your role what your role really is moving into jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president so carter a couple of things i mentioned that we ve got sunstrong and hannon armstrong sustainable real estate these are platforms that are an evolution of our origination strategy we ve always talked about johnson controls having a master purchase agreement that s 20 years old and we just add new pages to it each year what we re doing with sunstrong hasire ph and a few other efforts are significantly more complex they are effectively joint ventures that are not as simple as adding another addendum to a master purchase agreement so in looking at how the business is evolving it s fantastic to have a great business person on staff who can really step into these ventures as a business person not not just a transact or not that we don t cherish our transactors but there is an experience that we need to bring to bear in these joint ventures because our clients are big companies and they have a load of staff we don t so it s good to have brendan now able to be our load of staff to match up with our clients and as you know his intellective is more than one persons so we ll just delighted to have him available now with lipson coming on board with that brendan do you want to expand on that j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president go ahead carter carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst i was going to say so i mean is it it s a deepening of relationships in a different form is that the right characterization or j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president i think it s part of that and i think the other two things that we ve talked about is as kind of goals is how do we capture more of this emerging market opportunity what is it and how do you capture it and then how do you do it in a more profitable way so i think those are kind of the three things i m going to be primarily focused on how can we continue to grow and capture and develop new niches either through partnerships or otherwise and how do we do it more profitably and enhance the business further carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst if you re successful is it reasonable to assume a higher level of roe over time j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president yes i think so jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president i hope so carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst just a quick follow up so in terms of like rate normalization do you have like a monitor that we could ourselves whether it s a inaudible commercial paper and some other long yielding instrument where you get some level of spread for some duration that would kind of tip the balance more toward on balance sheet versus securitization i mean are there effect of number of different metrics you utilize jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president yes we do the first thing we do on every management meeting on monday is look at interest rates spreads trends so on and so forth and so we look one of the things we look at is the inaudible so if you look at the curve now and we compare it against last week and against last year and you obviously see it s very flat and in some places it s actually inverted so we look at we look at that obviously we would like to see steepening we pay attention to what the fed says because they re the ones that determine things but also look at other sources so we look at a variety of things but from a curve flattened standpoint it s basically a inaudible carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst perfect thank you welcome aboard jeff and appreciate taking all my questions thanks guys jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you appreciate that operator we ll now take a question from david cater ph with baird david cater robert w baird co analyst hi guys thank you for taking the question quickly looking on guidance for next year and i don t want to get too ahead of ourselves after a strong quarter but can you talk about what happens to get you to the low end of guidance and the high end is that all volatility in gain on sale income and then maybe speaking more long term what can jump start eps growth rates in your view does it require a steepening in the yield curve or do you have what other levers do you have to kind of accelerate growth j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president you want to jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president yes so i think this is our last question brendan and this is your last inaudible j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so good question david i didn t give you a blank look so i think yes gain on sale obviously has a big impact because that s variable and i think as we ve always talked we don t control closing so it s something slips to the right especially in a gain on sale has a much bigger impact on eps than if a one balance sheet transaction slips i think we can think we re continuing to do the right things in the business to set the business up for the future and to grow more we think that we re in this for the long haul as jeff said it s late cycle so we don t necessarily don t want to be in a situation where feel like we re reaching for things so it s a matter of being disciplined in how we approach it but we do think that there s lots of exciting opportunities so we re going to continue that discipline but also look for places where we can either grow origination or add more assets to the balance sheet or lower our cost of debt so i think those three things we ve always talked about how we grow earnings and growing earnings is new additional assets it s increasing the net interest income it s the continuing to work on our operating leverage and we still have i think a lot of ability to increase our finance leverage also so we continue to think and focus about those things and that s how we ll be able to continue to grow earnings above kind of what we said david cater robert w baird co analyst that s great thank you guys j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thank you jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator and it appears there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the conference back to mr jeff eckel for any additional or closing remarks jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you once again you asked good questions we look forward to

in an american economy driven by silicon valley where americans pay more than half of their bills online and millennials have taken to online social platforms like venmo to split the bill for dinner cash continues to represent nearly a third of transactions in the united states in fact though you wouldn t know it from the ubiquitous swiveling ipads at your local coffee shop cash is the most frequent method of payment in the us more frequent than electronic credit debit or check payments while the expansion of mobile payment platforms ever increasing internet retail sales and cashless innovations worldwide may seem to herald the end of cash even top executives at venmo and paypal do not believe in its imminent demise i would never predict the death of cash over the next decade or two paypal ceo dan schulman recently forecast recently proposed legislation across the united states supports mr schulman s prediction as a number of state and city legislators are seeking to mandate that retailers continue to accept cash going cashless though cash has retained its preeminent status in the united states and remains dominant across much of the developing world a coalition of good governance tech and payment industry advocates continues to push for its demise in favor of a cashless economy though their advocacy touches on arguments ranging from public health to curbing illegal immigration these proponents of going cashless tend to focus on the vast potential for increased security and economic efficiency perhaps the most visceral of their arguments is the idea that the absence of cash on hand would greatly reduce the risk of thefts and robberies of retail stores and individuals in addition many retailers have noted the economic inefficiencies inherent to cash businesses including hiring armored truck pickups paying banking fees compensating employees for the physically accounting for large amounts of cash and dealing with human error other advocates claim additional benefits many anti corruption and good governance groups have expressed optimism that a reduction in cash transactions may help to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering or tax evasion kenneth s rogoff former chief economist of the imf and author of 2016 s the curse of cash believes that in addition to reducing corruption both in the united states and in countries where the u s dollar serves as an unofficial currency there are a number of ancillary public policy benefits for example the phasing out of cash might serve as an effective deterrent to illegal immigration since the wages of undocumented workers are generally paid in cash additionally mr rogoff argues the removal of cash would allow for more proactive and experimental government responses during economic crises such as negative interest rates still other experts have pointed to the health benefits cash is a prime bacterial conduit and disease carrier there is of course also an element of self interest for many advocates of a cashless society bills mandating cash acceptance have faced intensive lobbying from the credit card industry as well as more tech focused retailers the passage of the new jersey legislation exemplifies such forces at work the bill s sponsor specifically criticized a recent visa initiative that rewarded 50 businesses with 10 000 each for making their operations cashless the legislation s passage was also threatened by several large retailers experimenting with cashless stores whose influence forced the shelving of the bill last summer consumer advocates have argued that any decline in the use of cash is a step toward growing monopoly power for credit card companies who could charge increased swipe fees out of proportion to actual costs detractors of cashless societies as well as consumer advocacy groups have made a range of practical and moral arguments in opposition to phasing out cash transactions on the practical end of the spectrum they have contended that corruption has done just fine in the digital age digital finance has created new concerns related to corruption including data privacy cybersecurity the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions and more privacy advocates warn about handing over our financial lives not to mention the global economy to corporations and governments they argue that the recent furor over corporate america s handling of data privacy issues is evidence of the risks of sharing important personal and financial information meanwhile the chinese government s extensive monitoring of its citizens purchases and debts in order to dole out social credit scores exemplifies the risks involved in trusting governments to regulate such systems in both cases there is a high degree of concern that going cashless would expose the financial system to capture by some variant of the surveillance state on the moral end of the spectrum there is concern for the unbanked and underbanked thirty percent of united states households fall within this category inclusive of over 14 million unbanked adults and 48 9 million underbanked adults a category that includes those who have a checking or savings account but used at least one of money orders check cashing international remittances payday loans refund anticipation loans rent to own services pawn shop loans or auto title loans in the past 12 months councilmember ritchie j torres the sponsor of a proposed ban on cashless retailers in new york city to declare cashless policies both classist and racist cashless business model will have the effect of excluding lower income communities of color from what should be an open and free market although arguments over going cashless in the united states remain largely hypothetical countries around the world are rapidly approaching such an outcome sweden in particular has become the prime example of this drive only about 10 percent of swedish consumers paid for something in cash in 2018 with bills and coins representing only 1 percent of the swedish economy in the developing world kenya too has been anointed a cashless success story kenya s mobile payment company m pesa counts a majority of kenya s population among its customer base and sees a quarter of kenya s gdp running through its systems in sweden financial institutions have realized revenue gains from the transition to a more fintech based economy while in kenya estimates indicate that m pesa has lifted 2 percent of the population out of extreme poverty despite these successes each country offers cautionary tales in sweden going cashless has had an adverse impact on elderly and rural populations transitioning to online and mobile payment systems requires a degree of tech savvy and tech accessibility often lacking in these demographics in addition the swedish government continues to be concerned about the risk to the financial system from a cyberattack or attack on the nation s power grid kenya faces similar concerns as well as wariness over the outsized impact that one corporation now has on the nation s economy arguments also persist over the potential classist impacts of the new financial environment and the trade offs related to data privacy legislation in the united states in recent weeks legislators across the united states have taken their own steps to forestall cash s obsolescence in early february 2019 the new jersey legislature passed a bill requiring that retailers must accept cash from customers violators will face penalties of 2 500 for the first offense and 5 000 for the second offense with any further violations falling under the state s consumer fraud act the legislation specifically excludes from the cash acceptance requirement those transactions made online by telephone or by mail in addition retailers inside airports are not required to accept cash assuming that the bill which passed with near unanimous support in the state house and senate is signed by governor phil murphy new jersey will become the second state after massachusetts to enshrine the acceptance of cash in state law the massachusetts law although rarely enforced has been on the books since 1978 and prevents retailers from discriminat against a cash buyer by requiring the use of credit the cities of new york philadelphia washington d c and even san francisco are all considering mandatory cash acceptance legislation of their own a similar proposal was introduced last year in chicago albeit unsuccessfully the sponsors of these proposals when introducing their bills to the public have tended to focus on the need for an accessible and inclusive financial community if you haven t gone cashless you might look at a dollar bill in your pocket and consider the preemptive effect of the statement this note is legal tender for all debts public and private case law has indicated however that prior to the completion of a transaction no debt has been incurred limiting the impact of this pronouncement printed on all greenbacks and reproduced in u s code in addition treasury department guidance states that refusing cash may be allowable on a reasonable basis such as when doing so increases efficiency prevents incompatibility problems with the equipment employed to accept or count the money or improves security as such state and city legislation has been cropping up in the absence of specific federal regulations in this area though cash is far from buried in the united states it is also now far from king it remains to be seen whether legislation like that passed in new jersey earlier this month and currently under discussion in new york philadelphia washington and san francisco is a harbinger of the renewed importance of cash transactions to the american economy or the final gasps of a gradually fading economic model dwt will continue to monitor developments in this space with regard to ongoing legislative activities and industry trends more broadly

for the big interview this week i caught up with jim pearce jim is the chief investment strategist of our flagship publication personal finance he began his career as a stockbroker in 1983 and over the years has managed client investment portfolios for major banks brokerage firms and investment advisors jim is a veteran observer of the markets you ll find his answers a useful backdrop for your investment decisions q the current recovery is getting long in the tooth most analysts predict an economic downturn will occur in 2019 or at the latest 2020 what s your view do we face a full blown recession or a softer landing how should investors prepare a for a variety of reasons i believe a soft landing is the most likely outcome despite persistently strong employment data inflation has stubbornly remained near 2 that has caused the federal reserve to back away from the hawkish stance it took last summer towards raising rates lower interest rates means more money is spent on goods and services and less spent on servicing debt also helping is low oil prices pricey energy is a net drag on the overall economy higher transportation storage and production costs get passed on to the consumer keeping those costs low encourages more consumer spending finally we have an incumbent in the white house as we head into the next election cycle president trump will do everything he can to keep the economy from going off the rails before november 2020 q the u s is enjoying the lowest unemployment rate since richard nixon occupied the white house where do you see the jobless rate heading in 2019 a the economy is very close to full employment so the unemployment rate isn t likely to improve from where it is now the unemployment rate bottomed out at 3 7 in november but rose to 4 by january most economists agree that an unemployment rate of 4 is optimal for the economy in terms of maximizing employment while leaving enough slack to prevent wages from going up too fast the windfall benefits of last year s tax cut enacted in december 2017 have run their course so i expect big companies won t be hiring as many people going forward as they have been recently i believe the unemployment rate will rise to 4 5 during the second half of 2019 q the stock market suffered a nasty decline in december 2018 do you foresee further sharp sell offs in the coming months which sectors seem especially vulnerable now a i don t expect another 20 correction but i wouldn t be surprised to see one or more quick dips in the 5 10 range in 2019 in particular the real estate industry is vulnerable to rising interest rates if the fed resumes its hawkish stance towards containing inflation i d expect real estate investment trusts to take a pretty big hit the utility sector would also suffer if rates rise too fast higher bond yields would siphon money out of traditional equity income stocks such as utilities into investment grade debt despite the tech sector s sell off at the end of last year i m still leery of high multiple tech stocks since most of them recovered so quickly over the past two months as the economy slows many of them will end up coming up short of analysts overly optimistic expectations for sales and profits q we re witnessing a transition from momentum stocks to value which sectors currently present the best value a the energy sector has sold off in response to falling oil prices so now is a good time to increase exposure to high quality oil producers many of them pay dividend yields that are higher than bond yields and their share prices should appreciate when oil prices inevitably cycle higher financial stocks are trading at very low multiples so i d expect to see many of them do well this year the average forward price to earnings ratio fpe of the financial sector is 20 below its long term average while the average dividend yield is 10 higher than average a simple reversion to the mean could push many financial stocks up 10 20 in 2019 q what are the greatest risks confronting the stock market in 2019 how should investors hedge against these risks a the single greatest known risks are rising inflation and economic weakness in europe and asia for those reasons i suggest the following three pronged approach to managing portfolio risk concentrate equities in low multiple high dividend stocks primarily in the u s exchange fixed rate bonds for preferred stocks and convertible bonds and hedge against rising inflation by owning commodity stocks q as inflation rises and geopolitical risk worsens do you see favorable tailwinds for gold this year a yes very much so in fact i recently predicted that the price of gold would rise above 1 500 an ounce by the end of 2019 which would be a 15 gain from where it started the year as you mention all three of the major macroeconomic factors that cause gold to appreciate are in play this year rising inflation a cheaper dollar and heightened geopolitical risks for that reason i recently added a gold mining company to the personal finance growth portfolio got any questions for our experts email john persinos at mailbag investingdaily com john and jim just discussed

guidance range constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry jim will discuss the financial results my comments will focus on our 2018 highlights and the year ahead our fleet performed well in 2018 palo verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon free electricity production generating 31 1 million megawatt hours of energy it is also notable that the team at palo verde completed the scheduled 2018 spring refueling and maintenance outage in 28 days and 13 hours the shortest in palo verde history turning to our generation needs in 2018 we issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 megawatts of battery storage to be located on up to five of our az sun sites based upon our evaluation of the rfp responses we expanded the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 megawatts by adding a sixth az sun site which is expected to be in service by mid 2020 this investment will allow customers to use energy from our existing az sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets increases fuel savings for customers and further advances our clean energy portfolio goals in addition we have entered into purchase power agreements for over 600 megawatts of peaking capacity resources beginning in 2021 these contracts are the result of our 2018 peaking capacity rfp and include 150 megawatts of battery storage and a 463 megawatt summer seasonal natural gas power purchase agreement looking forward we will continue our efforts to meet future customer needs with clean technologies to accomplish this we plan to install at least 660 megawatts of aps owned solar plus battery storage and stand alone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025 we expect to procure the first 260 megawatts in 2019 when added to our current commitments we expect to invest in a total of 950 megawatts of clean technology by 2025 in addition to our investment in generation resources needed to support customer growth i d like to highlight two other examples of capital investments benefiting customers first we installed an additional transformer near four corners increasing our ability to meet rising demand for wheeling services the total project cost was 25 million invested from 2016 through 2018 we received 12 million in additional transmission revenue after placing the transformer in service in 2018 customers will benefit from lower rates going forward as a result of our increased ability to offer these services the second investment is located in the west valley we continue to see new companies building out on the west side of phoenix to support this growth we plan to invest 100 million to construct a new west valley service center that is expected to be completed in 2022 turning to the regulatory front in january the arizona corporation commission voted to conduct a review of aps 2018 books and records to determine whether the 2017 rate review order was implemented properly and whether aps has earned more than its allowed rate of return in our opinion reviewing aps 2018 books and records is a constructive way for the commission to complete its due diligence and gain confidence in the outcome of our last rate review we appreciate the commission s commitment to understanding the facts and we ll be providing the commission staff with the information they need to complete the review by the may 3rd deadline we re confident the rate increase was implemented appropriately consistent with the rate review order as jim will discuss our 2018 arizona jurisdictional return on equity was 9 5 which is less than the authorized 10 return on equity the commission has also opened a docket to evaluate retail competition in arizona there are numerous legal challenges consumer issues and logistical challenges with implementing retail competition for example implementation would require an amendment to the arizona constitution given the challenges we believe it would be very difficult to implement retail competition in arizona as things stand today however there is always value in exploring different options and understanding the spectrum of possible opportunities we appreciate the commission s interest in understanding the negative impacts retail competition has had on residential customers in other states two other important items in front of the commission are the four corners scr step increase request and a request to return an additional 86 5 million in tax savings to customers on november 27th of 2018 the administrative law judge issued a recommended opinion and order consistent with the commission staff s proposed 58 47 million revenue increase we expect a decision on the scr step increase request and the tax refund request in early 2019 for our company we believe 2019 will be a productive year with our strategic priorities centered around clean energy affordability and reliability we recognize that achieving success in our corporate strategic initiatives will only happen through our people putting our people first and prioritizing development has been at the forefront i m pleased to highlight the recent promotion of jeff guldner previously our executive vice president of public policy to his new position as president of aps jeff is a strong and thoughtful leader with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing our industry i know that under his leadership the company will be well positioned to meet the challenges presented by a growing arizona and i look forward to working closely with jeff to lead our company forward in summary we delivered on our commitments in 2018 and are well positioned for 2019 and the long term we have clear priorities and a strong leadership team in place to achieve our goals we remain focused on creating value in our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments i ll now turn the call over to jim james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you don and thank you again everyone for joining us today this morning we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 as you can see on slide 3 of the materials we had a successful year before i review the details of our 2018 results let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter which can be found on slide 4 for the fourth quarter of 2018 we earned 0 23 per share compared to 0 19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted gross margin was down 0 15 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 higher sales related revenue and the change in residential rate design and seasonal rates were more than offset by the unfavorable weather and the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform as a reminder the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers the new rates shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non summer months better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve offsetting the decrease in adjusted gross margin were lower operating and maintenance expenses higher pension and other post retirement benefits non service credits other income and lower adjusted income tax expense for the full year of 2018 we delivered solid results with earnings at the upper end of our guidance range earning 4 54 per share compared to 4 35 per share in 2017 reflected in these results is an acc jurisdictional roe of 9 5 when we calculated the acc jurisdictional roe we excluded revenue related to ferc jurisdiction ferc represents approximately 17 of rate base and has an authorized roe of 10 75 turning your attention to slide 5 i ll review some highlights of our full year results gross margin was a key driver during the year with a few core components the rate increase that went into effect on august 19th 2017 contributed 0 69 per share however increases in operating expenses offset a portion of the benefit to gross margin transmission revenue added 0 18 per share due in part to the addition of new long term wheeling agreements the lfcr added incremental growth to our gross margin of 0 02 per share higher sales related revenue added 0 16 per share to gross margin in 2018 driven by customer growth and higher average effective prices offsetting drivers included the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform and unfavorable weather looking next to operating expense operations and maintenance expense was up in 2018 compared to 2017 decreasing earnings by 0 50 per share primarily due to higher cost at aps for planned outages transmission and distribution and customer service costs information technology and the parent level higher public outreach costs higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings 0 33 per share in 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase was primarily related to plant additions and the 61 million annual increase in d a rates approved in the 2017 rate order other taxes were higher in 2018 relative to 2017 reflecting higher property values and the impact related to the amortization of our property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate order pension and other post retirement benefits non service credits increased pre tax income by approximately 25 million or 0 17 per share in 2018 compared to 2017 the increase was primarily related to higher market returns in 2017 and the adoption of new pension and opeb accounting guidance in 2018 lastly the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was offset by a lower effective tax rate as illustrated in more detail on slide 13 the net effect of adjusted net income including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts offset by non deductible costs and other items decreased earnings 0 08 per share as you know arizona s economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis i ll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy now looking to slide 6 metro phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average in 2018 employment in metro phoenix increased 3 3 compared to 1 6 for the entire us job growth remained strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors a sign of strength in the regional economy construction employment increased by 11 5 in 2018 and manufacturing employment increased by 5 9 we expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development the metro phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post recession trend in 2018 we expect a total of 30 000 housing permits an increase of about 4 200 compared to 2017 driven by single family permits in 2019 we expect a total of 34 000 permits continuing the upward trend we have seen since the end of the recession we believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the metro phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions aps retail customer base grew 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 7 for the entire year we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends i just discussed importantly the long term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in arizona appear to be in place and we believe phoenix should remain one of the country s fastest growing large metropolitan areas switching to our financing activity on december 21st pinnacle west entered into a 150 million term loan facility that matures in december 2020 the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes in 2019 we expect to issue up to 950 million of long term debt at aps overall liquidity remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter pinnacle west had 76 million in short term debt outstanding and aps had no short term borrowings outstanding a quick note on pension the funded status of our pension remains healthy at 90 as of year end 2018 this was largely due to the continued success of our liability driven investment strategy which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook as shown on slide 7 we expect pinnacle west consolidated earnings for 2019 to be in the range of 4 75 to 4 95 per share a complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides we have extended our capital expenditures and rate base forecast through 2021 on slides 8 and 9 we anticipate aps capital investment to be around 1 5 billion in 2021 driven by investments in clean energy infrastructure to support our customer growth and grid modernization in closing 2018 was another great year for pinnacle west we delivered earnings at the top of our guidance range and increased our dividend for the seventh straight year 2019 is off to a great start with the announcement of the 950 megawatts of additional clean technologies and growth in the west valley our growth in clean energy investments are just a couple of examples supporting our long term rate base growth outlook of 6 to 7 this concludes our prepared remarks i ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions at this time we ll go first to ali agha with suntrust your line is open and ali your line is open please go ahead ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes hello good morning donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning ali ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst can you hear me first question on the four corner step increase i thought originally that was to have happened by the beginning of the year any reason for the delay in that and does that in any way impact your 19 guidance depending on when that does actually take place jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company yes ali this is jeff so the recommended opinion in order is out on the scr increase it has not gone to the commission yet it s possible that that could push out to when they re further into the rate audit and so that is just under way right now and it doesn t have an impact on guidance donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no we re very comfortable with the guidance ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst so assuming this happens around may time period that should still be fine with the guidance jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company yes ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay secondly on the rate base cagr so if i just took the 17 through 21 numbers that you re showing us that cagr is closer to 8 so just wanted to reconcile that with the 6 to 7 that you have on the same chart fair to say that at least for the next three four years we are running at a faster pace on that i see and then lastly just on the funding note there s obviously a pretty big step up in capex in 21 19 and 20 are pretty robust as well so can you just remind us where the equity needs show in and when external equity would be required to fund that and roughly how much how should we be thinking about that for modeling purposes james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer so any equity we issue would not necessarily be for 21 capex but it would be more related to the capital structure at aps and we will need to top that off at some point this year and if it isn t in the form of equity it would be a modest amount ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i see so think about that sometime later this year james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer if we did anything it would be later this year ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it thank you operator we ll move next to julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning can you hear me donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst so perhaps on a little bit on ali s questions first let me start where he left off on the capex front can you just elaborate a little bit 21 is obviously the first year of higher capex you talk about this 2019 rfp of 260 megawatts is that the full amount reflected in 21 and i just want to understand a little bit and i acknowledge we re early on how the cadence of that rfp could play out into subsequent years and again under the assumption that you own this and the other little piece if you could address is we haven t seen too many storage projects in utility ownership yet how are you thinking about the dollar per kilowatt capital cost here right i e the number of hours etcetera the parameters if you will donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so i think in terms of what we have announced to date the accommodation of ppa and ownership as we move forward we re more inclined to ownership but the rfps will dictate what we do as well as cost moving forward julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay fair enough but the 260 megawatts is that fully baked into 2021 itself i mean is there some that leads into bleeds into 22 and then separately i presume that you re assuming that you ve got you ve got the 260 megawatts in your outlook or is there some hair cutting of that donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer we have in the outlook what is to expected to incur by 2021 yes julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay excellent and just to come back to the four corners side of the equation real quickly obviously sales are oriented toward the summer is there anything further in terms of the timeline here that would give the acc some need or requirement to kind of vote on that thing james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer no not a requirement julien but yes it s the rate audit right now is scheduled to go through may 3rd julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it but is there any reason to link one versus the other obviously i mean they are separate and distinct in efforts here there s no reason to think they re going to wait for that james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer they are separate right but one of the things they are looking at is whether there was overearning in 2018 donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer and we feel that once the commissioners have the information in their hand they ll make an informed decision julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it all right excellent i ll leave it there thank you very much operator we ll move next to insoo kim with goldman sachs insoo kim goldman sachs analyst thank you regarding the upsized weather normalized load growth assumption from 19 to 21 i think my understanding is that that s the impact of the distributor generation impact coming off and maybe some less of the energy efficiency investments that should more align customer growth with load growth especially on the ee side have you seen have you been seeing the effects of customer education to use more power at the off peak hours it seems like the upside growth kind of depends on the changes in customer behavior on usage jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company i would say that s an impact on really prices realized and not inaudible consumed i think what we saw was a very strong fourth quarter with 0 3 growth and we re beginning to see the economic activity in the west valley which is what we ve been talking about for a couple years begin to come to fruition i will say meter sets which are a leading indicator exceeded budget in january for the first time in a long time so we re seeing now the realization of this economic activity happening insoo kim goldman sachs analyst so that when you look at the changes in customer growth outlook that moderated down about 0 5 on average annually but the load growth went up so that would assume that the usage per customer whether it s retail or residential or commercial that is expected to pick up donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s correct insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it and then in regards to the clean energy investments including storage would that be need to go through a rate case for recovery or are there contemplations on potential mechanisms to cover the costs and earn a return during the construction donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so the ppa construct would go through a procedure to get it into the psa the rate base will be recovered in normal course over time insoo kim goldman sachs analyst inaudible rate case right donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes insoo kim goldman sachs analyst understood thank you very much james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you insoo operator we ll go next to charles fishman with morningstar research charles fishman morningstar research analyst the questions i have are concerning slide 8 the capital expenditure and specifically the new bar 2021 is the increase in coal generation is that a little less than 200 million between 21 and 20 is that the expansion of the battery program james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that would be battery and as well as utility scale solar charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay and then that new distribution center in west phoenix that you mentioned where does enter in on the bars what year we re at james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer the activity for it is occurred some in 18 and will occur in 19 in 20 and 21 the infrastructure for the west valley will be ongoing charles fishman morningstar research analyst roughly how much i envision that as a facility for your distribution trucks and people and things is that am i picturing that correctly daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company yes charles this is daniel froetscher yes that is facility to be used for predominantly our transmission and distribution teams it s located in the west valley sits on about an 88 acre parcel it s a multi year build that will total roughly 85 million to 90 million charles fishman morningstar research analyst got it okay that s all i had thank you operator we ll move next to michael weinstein with credit suisse michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey so the irp that filing that s coming up in the spring is book how much more of the how much more capex can we expect to see or how much of an early indication is the 2021 bump in capex as to how this irp is going to be shaping up and how many more years of view ph do you think we ll get out of that at that point daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company michael this is daniel froetscher i wouldn t correlate necessarily our preliminary irp which is due a little later this year to 2021 and beyond we obviously haven t forecast the capex beyond 2021 i think the irp will foundationally serve as a forward look shaping mechanism relative to our resource requirements and our desired resource choices for additional capacity in energy michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you and are you getting any kind of indication from commissioner kennedy as to her desire for renewables at this point is she i m just curious about what kind of talks you ve had with the new commissioners jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company michael this is jeff so commissioner kennedy when she came on the bench indicated that she was going to propose or was talking about a 50 renewable energy standard by 2028 and so that s what we ve heard from her commissioner tobin as you can recall has a proposal for 80 clean standard and so we expect there will be some dialog at the commission around those various proposals michael weinstein credit suisse analyst do you think that will be entering into the draft irp jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company well the irp so the irp is going to certainly intersect that at some point so it s a little hard to tell how exactly all that s going to ultimately unfold but obviously if you file an irp and they re having some discussion around those potential standards they re going to intersect michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you okay thank you operator we ll go next to paul patterson with glenrock associates paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so was wondering with this increase in retail sales and i apologize if i missed this when is the next time you guys expect to go into for a rate case ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst right now our expectation is to file june 1 of 2020 paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then with respect to the discussion around competition what do you think is driving that i mean i hear you guys arguments on how it doesn t really work for most rate payers but what do you think is driving the sort of i m old enough to remember when this first came up what do you think is causing this new interest jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company paul i think that as certainly you saw in nevada there was a push there there is still discussions that i think occur around the country periodically it has been a topic in arizona kind of off and on for a while we continue to see the challenges as don mentioned in his comments the legal framework here in arizona is constitutionally grounded and so that makes it more challenging to implement something here but again the conversations in terms of what our customer is realizing in her states what are the challenges being confronted in other states those are all good conversations to have and we will share our viewpoints on that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay with respect to the battery and solar combination how should we think about sort of what that how that compares in terms of cost and flexibility to a gas plant if such a comparison can be made or what kind of capacity value can we sort of should we think about with the combination of these things do you follow me if there is any quantitative sort of number that you have around this daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company paul this is daniel excuse me this is daniel i would simply say that coming off of our 2018 request for proposals we were pleasantly surprised by the cost competitiveness of batteries in general obviously we have made some decisions then that as an alternative to gas as a peaking capacity for the late afternoon early evening ramp that we experience from a systems standpoint that battery storage charged by day time solar generation for three to four hour ramp windows in that late afternoon early evening timeframe is a viable solution for our customers and our system paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and by viable i mean without the environmental benefits and what have you would you say it s higher than what we d see if you had a gas plant sort of thing working with solar or i mean is there any do you follow what i m saying i m just trying to get sort of a picture as to how that what that kind of means if you follow me daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company yes i would simply say we found it to be quite cost competitive paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay impressive and then just finally back on the question about customer sales which really seem to your forecast is really bumped out without customer growth really changing is that the size of the customer that you mentioned economic growth could you just elaborate just a little bit further on that in terms of what exactly how that actually is that just because they are larger customers that are coming on board or that the customers that you have are going to be using a lot more electricity just sort of how should we think about that donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think what you re seeing in the west valley is a lot of large commercial warehousing distribution data center so you re getting a different mix of customer in that customer growth as well paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay awesome thanks so much guys have a great weekend donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator with no other questions i ll turn the conference back to the speakers for closing remarks stefanie layton investor relations contact

on retail electric and gas sales alliant energy s retail electric and gas sales increased in 2018 and decreased in 2017 largely due to impacts of temperatures on customer demand wpl s retail electric and gas rate settlement includes an earnings sharing mechanism whereby wpl must defer a portion of its earnings and return this amount to its retail electric and gas customers if its annual regulatory return on common equity exceeds 10 25 during 2018 as a result a majority of the higher margins recognized at wpl as a result of the temperature impact on retail electric and gas sales in 2018 is currently expected to be returned to customers in the future a portion of alliant energy s performance pay is based on earnings as a result a portion of the higher earnings resulting from the

sharing mechanism and the portion of performance pay associated with temperature impacts on earnings is estimated to be a 0 06 per share increase in 2018 earnings by comparison the impact of temperatures in 2017 was estimated to be a 0 06 per share loss tax adjustments due to federal tax reform the enactment of federal tax reform had a material impact on the 2017 financial statements the

2017 during the third quarter of 2018 additional rules were issued including clarifications of the treatment of bonus depreciation deductions as a result of these clarifying rules the impact of

top globalists are coming out of the closet thousands of leading globalists communists islamists and others from around the world converged on the arabian peninsula this month for the world government summit their goal promote technocratic globalism and plot the future of what they often call their new world order senior officials from the united nations the world bank the international monetary fund the european union communist china central banks and even the trump administration showed up to mingle with heads of state and advocates of islamic sharia law from across the region even pope francis delivered a message as usual despite top u s media outlets partnering with the summit the establishment press in the united states largely failed to inform americans about it news releases promoting the world government summit yes it is really called the world government summit boasted that the event is setting the agenda for the next generation of governments and one of the key goals of the summit was advancing the implementation of the un sustainable development goals sdgs often referred to as un agenda 2030 un deputy secretary general amina mohammed opened the summit by demanding that the radical un scheme be implemented to avoid life threatening consequences for billions of people un high commissioner for the 2030 agenda cristina gallach echoed the hysteria and throughout the summit more than a few speakers touted the controversial un agenda as if it were the key to saving humanity from every problem under the sun the un goals as this magazine has documented include national and global wealth redistribution government control over the economy globalist indoctrination of all children surrendering more sovereignty to global institutions and much more they are essentially a master plan for humanity as un bosses put it to build a global technocratic government that would dominate every facet of human existence unsurprisingly the mass murdering communist dictatorship enslaving china boasted that it played a crucial role in developing the un agenda and dictators from around the world celebrated the plan as well the world government summit formally launched its sdg s in action wgs platform in 2016 in partnership with the un the world bank and other outfits and the line up of speakers was universally supportive of the agenda in an address delivered to the world government summit after signing a controversial agreement with a top sunni muslim imam pope francis a fervent advocate of un agenda 2030 offered his best wishes for the work of summit attendees urging cooperation to address the problems of each person in the global village the pope called for more environmentalism while using leftist rhetoric to drive a wedge between people and capital and economic interests pope francis also specifically promoted sustainable development which is the ideology underpinning the un agenda 2030 sustainable development goals that seeks to limit the human population and fundamentally transform civilization under the guise of saving the planet we cannot really speak of sustainable development without solidarity he said using a buzzword that along with fraternity has become a staple for the pope and has raised alarm even among catholic scholars we could even say that the good if it is not the common good is not actually good i hope that your efforts at the service of the common good may bear fruit the pope s blessing of the world government summit was especially bizarre considering that in 2017 the event took place under the shadow of a replica of the roman arch in front of the pagan temple of ba al the monument to the demonic idol who is frequently referenced in the bible originally stood in palmyra syria a city known in the bible as tadmore among other concerns this false pagan god demanded child sacrifices and other horrors that outraged the god of the bible while a number of replicas were planned the very first was prominently displayed at the 2017 world government summit attracting fierce criticism and deep concern among religious scholars especially in light of the world government motif as in previous years some celebrities showed up to lecture humanity about the alleged need to submit to global governance and sustainable development to supposedly save the planet from humanity actor harrison ford shown for instance went on a tirade against nationalism and isolationism after a bizarre segment in which he pretended to speak for nature i could give a damn with or without humans i m the ocean ford said pretending to be nature while speaking in a strange voice i covered this entire planet once and i can always cover it again it was not clear whether he intended to refer to the biblical flood of noah s time or some other period during which he believes the oceans may have covered the entire planet ford a lifelong democrat also slammed president donald trump for allegedly denying science on climate change around the world elements of leadership including in my own country to preserve their state and the status quo deny or denigrate science ford said as whistleblowers and scientists from the un continued to expose the un s lies and pseudo science they are on the wrong side of history according to un intergovernmental panel on climate change sea level reviewer dr nils axel morner however who resigned in disgust when the un ipcc refused to correct its false information the lies underpinning the man made global warming hypothesis will inevitably be exposed globalists were everywhere at the event imf boss christine lagarde who suggested the imf might be moved from washington to beijing was a key speaker other leading globalist managers speaking at the summit included the scandal plagued chief of un wipo francis gurry who has come under fire for retaliating against whistleblowers and trying to have a reporter prosecuted un educational scientific and cultural organization unesco chief audrey azoulay a socialist working to standardize the indoctrination of children worldwide spoke as well un development program undp boss achim steiner unicef boss henrietta fore un general assembly president maria espinoza world food programme chief david beasley totalitarian minded un sdg peddler jeffery sachs world economic forum wef boss klaus schwab and numerous other globalist leaders spoke there too among the prominent media partners of the world government summit listed on the website were the new york times the financial times bloomberg cnbc the fake news kingpins at cnn sky news owned by the owner of fox news and many others it was not clear how they were expected to maintain impartiality about the agenda while also sponsoring the summit arianna huffington of the fringe left wing website huffington post and cnn international anchor becky anderson even spoke there along with other media personalities but as usual there was very little coverage of the event in american media perhaps because top globalists tend to openly promote globalism in a way that would alarm the u s public and jeopardize the agenda consider for instance the speech delivered by rwandan president paul kagame who spent much of his time promoting the subversion of sovereignty via regional and continental integration as he put it to create a united african continent we will only realize our full promise by joining together our historically fragmented markets and making it easier for people goods and services to move across our continent he said boasting of efforts by the globalist african union au to smash nation states that is why the african union adopted the african continental free trade area which is due to enter into force later this year we have also adopted a protocol on the free movement of people of course as leading globalist luminaries such as former u s secretary of state henry kissinger have explained regional governments such as the eu the au and more are a critical component of the globalist vision for the new world order that is why the eu the u s government and the communist chinese government have been pouring money into the au and other emerging regional governments even russian strongman vladimir putin is in the process of building a eurasian union as globalists in the united states pursue deeper integration of north america via nafta and the usmca also attending the world government summit was pakistani prime minister imran khan who urged investors to invest in pakistan even while boasting about the glories of a welfare state i am really against this neo liberal economics where you have 62 people owning as much wealth as 3 billion people on this earth he told the audience arguing that governments must take responsibility for taking care of poor people former colombian president juan santos who tried to hand his country over the marxist terrorists with help from key globalists spoke as well aside from the major media outlets big business partnered with the world government summit were mastercard kpmg deloitte mckinsey company and many other big business affiliates a broad array of global governance institutions partnered with the world government peddlers too including the un the imf the world health organization the world bank the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the world trade organization the un world intellectual property organization wipo and more among the more than 4 000 participants from 140 countries were a number of high profile americans among those who spoke on stage was u s energy secretary rick perry a bilderberg attendee who announced a robotics competition from the stage daniel kaniewski the deputy administrator of the federal emergency management agency fema was also there disgraced epa boss lisa jackson from the obama administration who still serves on the disgraced clinton foundation board was at the globalist summit as well and former trump secretary of state rex tillerson s chief of staff margaret peterlin spoke too while the establishment media keep americans divided and distracted with deception and frivolity ignoring real news such as the world government summit globalists are dropping the mask and coming out of the closet for all to see it seems everyone is welcome in the emerging new world order globalists communists islamists technocrats big business and more except patriotic americans and christian conservatives liberty loving americans must expose the subversive globalist agenda before it snuffs out liberty prosperity

amanda and good afternoon today we are announcing that we grew gaap earnings 32 year over year to 0 75 core earnings are up 9 year over year to 1 38 above the high end of our 2018 guidance given our accretive additions to the balance sheet and a strong pipeline we reiterate our guidance for 2019 and 2020 of 2 to 6 growth in core earnings from the 2017 base we also announced a 2 increase in the quarterly dividend to an annualized 1 34 per share as previously discussed we intend to grow the dividend but slower than the core earnings growth rate we closed a record 1 2 billion of transactions for the year with balance sheet transactions around the same level as 2017 and securitizations up compared to 2017 the combination of higher portfolio yields from the balance sheet investments and higher securitizations in 2018 allowed us to increase our core return on equity above 11 our pipeline remained strong at more than 2 5 billion especially in behind the meter assets in q4 we renegotiated our primary credit facility at lower rates and extended the maturity both good things 0 5 million metric tons of co2 will be reduced annually from our 2018 investments a carboncount score of 0 42 the business is in great shape and as our business has grown our need for talent has grown this is the perfect time to be making a transition brendan has done an outstanding job as our chief financial officer including coming up with the idea and strategy for taking the company public in 2013 effective march 1 brendan will assume a new leadership role focusing on strategy and our growth initiatives this is not an exit for brendan but a new role to use his considerable business skills and acumen to help us capture the very large climate finance opportunity in front of us we are seeing increasing ways to partner with leading companies to meet their growth objectives such as the previously announced sunstrong and hannon armstrong sustainable real estate collaborations brendan will have a leadership role in making sure these and our other initiatives are successful we welcome jeff lipson a 30 year corporate finance and banking veteran who joined us last month and will become cfo effective march 1 jeff will take over leadership of our finance and accounting teams as we look to continue to grow the business you ll be hearing from jeff later in the presentation and i look forward to introducing him in person when we hit the road for investor meetings turning to slide 4 we d like to address some of the key questions that are top of mind for our investors the market opportunity continues to grow and evolve in the 10 or so niche markets we invest in we are continuing to see better risk adjusted returns in assets that are behind the meter as opposed to grid connected assets this further reinforces the overarching themes we ve discussed before the three ds of the future electric power system decentralization digitalization and decarbonization this evolution is happening faster than we expected the competitive landscape remains largely the same in our various niche markets and we continue to believe if we stay committed to long term programmatic client relationships these relationships will continue to work as they did in 2018 on the pg e question we do not see any significant exposure to the pg e bankruptcy we own land under number of grid connected solar projects selling power to pg e where our rents are current we enjoy substantial asset and rent coverages and are well collateralized by assets and cash flow even if the ppas are rejected in bankruptcy and the project is selling to the merchant market as we have said for several quarters we like our position in the capital stack in these utility scale solar plants senior to all other capital providers while we like being senior in grid connected transactions given the relatively low equity returns and higher perceived risks we have increased our equity and mezzanine exposures in behind the meter assets including residential solar we ve always said we would make equity investments if we thought we were getting paid for the risk and we believe we are with our increased exposure to resi solar we ve managed about one third of the assets for almost five years giving us an informed view of the relative risk and believe we are getting paid appropriately for this diversified portfolio the yield curve continues to flatten and although we might prefer a normal upward sloping yield curve and correspondingly higher long term rates we ve demonstrated our business model is profitable in all interest rate environments including this flat yield curve environment we had limited impact from the recent government shutdown there were some payment delays inaudible approximately 30 of the agency shutdown but we ve always collected and expect a 100 collections this time as well to conclude on this page the green new deal has gotten people talking more about climate change which is a very good thing in our view while our business model will continue to prosper in virtually any public policy setting we continue to believe the carbon tax and dividend plan is the most impactful and economically efficient public policy approach turning to slide 5 we ve laid out our pipeline portfolio and credit profile the continued growth in the behind the meter portfolio is driving portfolio additions in earnings of the more than 2 5 billion pipeline about 75 is behind the meter efficiency solar and storage whether it s in a government building commercial business or residential property the 2 billion portfolio yield is up this quarter to 6 8 because of some of the balance sheet additions which i will review in a minute as well as the disposition of some lower yielding assets the assets remain diversified with respect to asset vendor and obligor concentrations finally on portfolio credit quality we have rated the increased exposure to some of these newer assets like resi solar and environmental restoration as non investment grade which increases the non investment grade category to 15 from 6 last quarter we will discuss this increase in more detail on the next slide in summary we continue to have less than 1 of the portfolio on non accrual status turning to page 6 we profile the three types of investments we made in non investment grade or equity transactions in the portfolio in q3 and q4 on the left side of the page our residential solar portfolio is approximately 300 million at year end with three of the top sponsors in the industry approximately 270 million of the investments are in a mezzanine structure with a balance of 30 million classified as equity as i mentioned at the outset we ve managed about a third of these assets for almost five years the transactions we completed shift this deeper in the capital stack and we believe improve our relative risk adjusted returns as a note the portfolio consist of 90 000 homeowners with attractive average fico scores of 750 the center of the page profiles an equity investment we made with one of the leading commercial and industrial solar sponsors this investment gives us a programmatic platform to expand this business more rapidly than we ve been able to do in the past finally the right hand side of the page profiles a four state wetlands mitigation and stream restoration investment we made in q4 similar to our q3 stormwater remediation investment we do expect more investments like these in the future all of these transactions were added to our balance sheet thus positioning us well at the start of 2019 for recurring revenues turning to slide 7 we d like to walk through how our record investment activity improves both 2018 roe and future year portfolio returns top left we show our growing programmatic client base that in part generated the 1 2 billion of investment activity while some of these assets are a great fit for our balance sheet as we just discussed others are not and are best securitized either way from our clients perspective we are providing a reliable capital solution in 2018 we securitized about 60 and put 40 on the balance sheet this higher level of securitizations of approximately 700 million allowed us to generate fees from the growth in the 5 3 billion of managed assets these additional fees contributed to our 11 1 core return on equity which has continued an upward trend although we would remind you that our target with a normalized level of securitizations remains 10 and with 40 or approximately 5 billion going on the balance sheet with improved yields largely in the last third of 2018 we ve improved our ability to generate recurring revenues for 2019 and beyond and reduce the importance of securitizations to achieve our earnings growth i will now turn it over to brendan to detail our financial performance j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thanks jeff turning to slide 8 for the year total revenue grew by approximately 32 million or 31 as compared to 2017 the increase was the result of higher gain on sale and fee income of 15 million due to the increased securitization volume and higher yields on our portfolio in the fourth quarter approximately 300 million of residential solar assets and our related 250 million of debt was prepaid both revenues and interest expense were impacted by this transaction we recorded approximately 13 million of interest income related to this prepayment this was offset by approximately 9 million of expense recorded in interest expense related to the debt repayment total revenue grew by approximately 12 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year as a result of the 15th sorry total revenue for the year grew by approximately 12 million as compared to same period last year as a result of the 15 million increase in investments due to higher yields and the prepayment described above excuse me total revenue by the grew by approximately 12 million for the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year as a result of the 15 million increase in investment revenue due to the higher yields and the prepayment described above increased investment revenue was offset by 3 million lower gain on sale and fee income for the quarter interest expense grew to 77 million from 65 million last year as a result of the higher fixed rate debt and the prepayment described earlier we completed a series of transactions in the second half of the year which lowered our interest cost such as refinancing our primary credit facility reducing the level of our interest rate swaps and the 250 million debt repayment which reduced our leverage interest expense for the quarter increased by approximately 1 million as these changes offset a large portion of the debt prepayment cost comp and general administrative expenses increased by approximately 5 million for the quarter and approximately 9 million for the full year primarily due to an increase in the size of the company as well as an additional bonus accrual in the fourth quarter to reflect the performance of the company for the quarter and the full year income from equity method investments was largely consistent with the same period in 2017 the non cash income tax expense rose by approximately 1 million for the year and was largely flat for the quarter in total we have 42 million or 0 75 per share of gaap income for the year compared to 31 million or 0 57 per share in 2017 as a reminder the gaap income does not include the full effect of the cash we receive from our equity investments in 2018 we collected 115 million in cash from these equity investments as compared to gaap income on these investments of approximately 22 million since we have based since we ve based our investment on future cash flows discounted back to a present value we believe the cash we receive reflects both a return of capital and a return on the investment thus we make a core adjustment of approximately 19 million to recognize the return on our investment which year to date when added to our gaap 22 million income gives a total core return of 41 million and thus the other 74 million represents a return of capital it is important to note that the interest expense associated with the leverage on these investments is shown in the interest expense line above as required under gaap stock comp and other adjustments were largely consistent for the quarter and the year as compared to last year in total core earnings were 76 million for the year a 9 increase for the quarter core earnings were 21 million an increase of 0 06 per share just to know for modeling purposes we would expect comp and g a on a core basis to be consistent with the first three quarters of the year in 2019 turning to slide 9 i will provide more comments on how our balance sheet has changed this year as we position for further growth in the fourth quarter we redeployed the 50 million of equity from the approximately 300 million of residential solar asset and our related 250 million of debt that was prepaid we also deployed the approximately 105 million primary equity raise and approximately 65 million from the atm into new projects jeff described earlier as we have demonstrated we raise equity to take advantage of good investment opportunities we successfully refinanced our primary credit facility extending the maturity to 2023 the new credit facility has increased flexibility and should lower annual interest cost by approximately 1 million we also diversified our credit facility lending group from one lender to a total of six lenders we lowered the fixed rate debt to 74 or approximately the midpoint of our range as a result of the debt repayment increased use of the floating rate facility and a reduction in the level of interest rate swaps this lower level of fixed debt reflects the change in the fed s outlook for interest rates finally the repayment of the 250 million of debt plus the approximately 170 million in equity raises lowers leverage to 1 5 to 1 0 while we would expect some releveraging given our current and historic leverage we are clarifying our leverage target to be more of a cap by inserting up to before the 2 5 to 1 0 as compared to the old fixed target of 2 5 to 1 0 these changes are expected to reduce interest expense by approximately 2 million a quarter in 2019 and when combined with a higher yield on assets is expected to allow us to achieve our guidance targets with lower gain on sale fees our stock remains largely institutional owned with employees owning approximately 5 before i turn it over to jeff lipson i would like to say that i m looking forward to working with jeff and in turning my attention to growing the business throughout my career i ve been fortunate enough to help businesses grow in several emerging industries the market and the need to address climate change is enormous i m excited to be in my new role in focusing on how we can better address the opportunity i will now turn it over to jeff lipson to talk about what he will be focusing on jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thank you brendan allow me to begin by expressing my enthusiasm for joining hannon armstrong and i look forward to working with all of our analysts and investors i joined the company at a perfect time jeff eckel s leadership has resulted in a strong financial performance and pipeline and brendan s leadership has optimized the capital and liquidity structure of the company my focus will be on expanding upon these successes and working with my colleagues to build a scalable platform to facilitate further growth in earning assets and eps moving to slide 10 of the presentation we maintain a debt structure that is limited refinance risk as most of our managed assets are either securitized or funded with amortizing non recourse debt the 2019 non recourse maturities are being addressed as we are currently negotiating extensions and term takeout financing as previously disclosed we are also currently evaluating corporate unsecured debt as part of our liquidity platform we also anticipate continuing to utilize regular way and the at the market equity offering programs to address liquidity needs and we will be refreshing our shelf and the current atm up to 250 million around the filing of our 10 k the graph at the bottom of page 10 further reinforces the limited maturities over the next few years now i ll turn the call back over to jeff eckel jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president welcome aboard jeff lipson jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thank you jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president turning to slide 11 we want to highlight some of our environmental social and governance metrics and the progress we ve made in the year as we ve discussed our investment thesis is that in a world increasingly defined by carbon we will earn superior risk adjusted returns investing on the right side of the climate change line we have long operationalized the thesis by using carbon count which calculates the carbon reduce per 1 000 of investment this is under the theory that if carbon counts and capital is scarce we should seek to make the most impactful investments as part of our commitment to transparently reporting the e in esg we published an annual sustainability report card disclosing the carboncount of every investment we made in the year and which will show a 0 42 carboncount in 2018 representing avoided carbon emissions we have continued our industry leadership in tcfd disclosures by integrating much of the disclosure into the 10 k we will be filing in the next few days our corporate culture is reflective of our commitment to esg which will be detailed in our forthcoming esg report coming out in q2 one example of this culture was the initiative of one of our young people to organize a team to install solar panels on low income housing in d c our employees commitment to advancing these types of initiatives is inspiring and i am honored to work alongside them turning to slide 12 in closing we couldn t be more optimistic about our business we re investing in a large and growing market over the long term estimates indicate our addressable market is a multi trillion dollar one that s true however we estimate the current addressable opportunity for the next five years with assets we like possessing attractive risk adjusted returns and sponsored by a top tier client in a programmatic effort to be closer to 100 billion still substantial this lower addressable market estimate indicates that we are carefully navigating the large opportunity set to ensure we are getting the best risk adjusted returns in these complex markets our client base is dominated by top tier firms growing to capture the decentralized digitalized and decarbonized future of energy these firms are the key to any of our success in combating climate change and we are grateful for the opportunity to support them by sticking with our programmatic focus we will also benefit from additional operating leverage our assets are well diversified relatively granular yet similar in structure giving us an excellent portfolio to manage we continued to have one of the most experienced teams in the industry and with our staff additions in 2018 and 2019 including jeff lipson of course we have deepened and broadened our skill thank you for joining us today we ll now open the call up for a few questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instruction we ll go first to julien dumoulin smith of bank of america anny liang bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi this is anny ph actually filling in for julien so i guess my first question is just wanted to get a sense of your strategy for the business model looking forward how much in on balance sheet assets are you looking to hold onto versus securitizations specifically what s a good estimate for the targeted split for 2019 and then going forward after that more long term j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so this year we did about 60 of securitizations and about 40 on balance sheet we would expect that that would continue at that level or probably depending on the assets we see we may increase putting on balance sheet as we ve talked about in the past our model longer term and in normal rate environment would be to be at 70 30 on balance sheet but given the flat yield curve a lot of the assets we originate our best we best realize the value in those by securitizing them so given the environment we would expect to continue to have a fairly high level of securitization comparable to this year or maybe slightly inside of that anny liang bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks and second what s your growth strategy in terms of resi solar market and specifically on that how much of that 75 of behind the meter pipeline over the next year would you expect to include resi solar maybe any information on what market you re looking to get into there and then what kind of return profiles are you aiming for resi solar jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well you ve got quite a few questions into your second question the 75 behind the meter is dominated by energy efficiency our legacy market resi solar is relatively new it s growing you julien covers most of the companies that are out there and some of whom are our clients now we expect it to be an interesting pipeline we would say that we re not going to become a residential solar finance company we re going to continue to build a diversified portfolio on balance sheet we like the assets we ve got we like the pipeline we ve got but really the efficiency market is growing just as fast as the resi solar market i m not trying to answer all of your questions but we haven t we have disclosed some of the returns on the resi solar portfolio so i won t repeat those and we haven t disclosed it we can t talk about them anny liang bank of america merrill lynch analyst alright sounds good thank you jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll go next to mark strouse with jpmorgan mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst yes good afternoon thanks for taking our questions so just starting off brendan thank you very much for your help getting us up to speed and congrats on the new role and jeff we look forward to working with you so our first question j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thanks mark mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst i mean it sounds like the pipeline is still very well diversified but just in particular looking at the 4q strength and the beat versus your guidance on the eps level is there any particular in markets that led to that outperformance that you can call out jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well i think it was last quarter we used the phrase that we re hitting on all cylinders and it s like a 10 cylinder engine we ve got 10 niche markets it really does continue whether it s q3 q4 or q1 we don t have that we have no control over which some of them fires but in general one half of them are hitting things go well when it s closer to all 10 it s pretty good business beyond that it s a good time to have the position we have in behind the meter assets with the behind the meter clients that we have i think this is where the the market is going and frankly it s coming right toward us mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst okay that s helpful and then just a quick follow up so your originations in 2018 were a bit above your long term targets of about 1 billion or so but just how should we think about that in 2019 i know it s kind of hard to predict but at this point are you expecting kind of similar levels to 18 or should we be modeling closer to your longer term targets jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well yes as you ve hinted at the business model still stands at 1 billion i think it s reasonable to think that if we re hitting on all 10 cylinders there s a good chance it s more than that at the same this is not a point in the business cycle where we want to reach for marginal assets and we re going to continue to be careful about which ones we go forward so the market is good we would prefer to optimize on picking the best risk adjusted returns rather than going for growth sake mark strouse j p morgan securities llc analyst yes makes sense keep up the good work thank you very much jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thanks operator we ll now take a question from noah kaye with oppenheimer co noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst thanks very much good afternoon i ll echo the congratulations to brendan on the evolution of your role and welcome aboard jeff i guess we re going to have to start this ambiguating ph by specifying which jeff we re talking to jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thanks noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst eckel i guess given the focus on behind the meter actually i wanted to ask you about activity around microgrids you talked about some of the signature projects like parris island microgrid we ve seen hawaii begin the preceding to actually create a microgrids tariff it looks like california could follow we understand these are typically long cycle development projects but just wondering if you re seeing uptick in activity there yes just comment if you could comment on the market jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president well the white house was in the news this morning for their new task force that s looking at resiliency issues with dod and certainly we continue to see dod continue to invest through espcs and effectively micro grids for resiliency and cost reductions i think all large campuses whether they are dod or not are probably thinking that way the best thing about these emerging trends is with our client base our clients are out there talking to the folks in hawaii and the us government and any of the other campuses and we may not hear about them but we have complete confidence that when those jobs go to execution time we re going to be in the mix for financing that so i think the kind of the conclusion on micro grids is if you have increasing increasingly violent storms having onsite generation is the only way you can ensure reliability so i guess the bad news is we re going to have worst storms the good news for hannon armstrong is that probably is positive for our future business noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst understood and then i guess just a question around your comments on capping your leverage really kind of seeing that 2 5 to 1 0 as a cap can you just elaborate on that a little bit in the context of how the portfolio is evolving you called out the increase in non investment grade exposure and how we kind of square this with the efforts of the company is making to look at the possibility of corporate debt j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president sure so couple of comments on that noah so first of all we ve never really hit the 2 5 to 1 0 we got the 2 4 to 1 0 but we never really hit the 2 5 to 1 0 so that was one comment the other comment and especially as you start to think about things like corporate debt and i ll take the transaction that was paid off this quarter we had 300 million of assets we had 250 million of debt so net equity was only 50 million so that when you look at that on a leverage basis that s pretty highly levered and if you just we re reporting the net equity number you d have a much lower leverage and enjoy the same if not a higher return so especially when you start to think about rating agencies and things it makes sense to kind of look at where you re levered and are you levered in the appropriate way and do the assets be kind of put on the balance sheet at a gross versus the net level noah kaye oppenheimer co analyst make sense thanks operator we ll now take a question from philip shen with roth capital partners philip shen roth capital partners analyst brendan congratulations as well and jeff looking forward to working with you back to resi solar jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thanks likewise philip shen roth capital partners analyst for a bit a follow up to anny s ph question earlier jeff eckel i know you had mentioned you guys do not want to become a resi solar finance company but when you look at these originators sunpower vivint sunrun et cetera they are installing meaningful megawatts every year can you maybe give us a little bit more color on what that line might be i think sunpower might be 300 megawatts this year vivint close to 200 megawatts and i think you mentioned that you are doing business with three resi solar companies but i believe you may have only announced two vivint and sunpower is it possible to talk about who that third one might be thanks jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thanks phil on your last point we always let our clients lead so whenever that third company chooses to disclose that that s when it will be public let me clarify one of your question when you said line what do you mean can you give us a view on the line you talked about sunpower and vivint but i m not sure what you re looking for philip shen roth capital partners analyst yes so there is a line between being not being a resi solar finance company and being one so how what is there a metric that you guys like at what point do you guys become too resi solar heavy and so how do you think about where that line might be on whatever metric you guys might use internally jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president that s a good question we clearly do not have a line that is quantitative i think we re very comfortable with where we are now we would probably be has ph to add significantly more at the same time a lot of these transactions ended up in the last third of the year we don t expect similar volumes in the first third of 2019 instead we ll see volumes in other markets we talked about wetlands and mitigation stream restoration those are coming on balance sheet we believe in the first third of the year c i solar so we kind of had a lump of resi solar at the end of the year and now it s time for us to add some other asset classes as we always expect to including pace assets philip shen roth capital partners analyst great thanks jeff one quick follow up on resi solar and forgive me but i m travelling two different earnings calls and i may have missed this in your prepared remarks but i recall the sunrun initial deal was a 100 plus million for mezzanine debt and then 10 million for equity and then now you guys are at inaudible mezzanine debt so incrementally is there 170 million more of the mezzanine debt and 20 million more of equity and can you just talk about who this might be with and apologies if you guys have already addressed this j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president yes so phil in the call we talked about 300 million we talked about we ve three other top sponsors and 270 million of it is classified as debt and 30 million is classified as equity we didn t give more detail but the fact that the transaction you re referring to is one of the three sponsors you can imagine that we did two other transactions that gave us the additional volume philip shen roth capital partners analyst okay thanks brendan and then lastly jeff you just mentioned c pace can you give us an update on how things stand there historically it s been it s still on the horizon is there some development to think that maybe in 2019 we could see some degree of acceleration in that end market jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president i would say it is still on the horizon but we are obviously talking about it we do think 2019 should be a pretty good year for c pace and we re very much we ve been investing in this platform those investments we think are starting to turn the corner and pay off so again we ll announce things when they re closed not before but we continue to think that s a sound market for us to invest in philip shen roth capital partners analyst great thanks jeff i ll pass it on operator we ll now take a question from christopher souther from cowen and company christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst hi welcome jeff and congrats on the new role brendan jeffrey a lipson new chief financial officer thanks chris christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst first question you just said that 60 40 split between securitization and balance sheet transactions given the industry environment inaudible kind of think of going forward as well but you also said you expected to hit the midpoint of guidance without kind of an elevated gain on sale are those gain on sale return thing pretty consistent just kind of curious that if you are keeping the 2020 range for eps despite kind of the strong 2018 when we get a sense of this is conservatism potential lumpiness or some other factor j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so i think to clarify that question a little bit chris we said the comment i made was we re going thought interest rate expense would decrease by about 8 million which would allow us to bring down gain on sale somewhat so i don t think we re talking that gain on sale as disappearing or anything but it s was 30 some million last year so it s going to go down from that number as we put more assets on the balance sheet and recognize more net interest income or net investment income off of those assets so i think it s a shifting or a sliding of the gain on sale versus a wholesale change the other point that you made is yes certain transactions are like anything else certain transactions the margins move around a little bit in total they are relative they ve been relatively consistent but they do move around a little bit depending on the transaction that we re securitizing jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president but we don t see any particular trend in securitization margins it s more of the mix in a quarter or in a year but if you take a much longer view it s pretty pretty much the same christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst okay that s helpful and then just kind of a to put the 300 million residential solar in context do you guys know how much of that was kind of new leases type thing as opposed to ones that were on the balance sheet of kind of these residential partners just to kind of get an idea of what the run rate is here i think might be helpful j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so i think the sunpower assets were disclosed they were the third of assets that we have had for roughly a third of the assets we ve had for five years that were refinanced and we just entered at a difference point in the capital stack i don t know that we re prepared to talk about it for the other two providers jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president but it fair to say two thirds are relatively new assets christopher curran souther cowen and company analyst okay that s helpful i appreciate you guys taking the questions jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator we ll now take questions from carter driscoll with b riley fbr carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst mr herron who is going to explain hlbv to me anymore i m going to have j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president i m still around carter i can still do that service for you carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst thank you terrified me there for a moment no seriously so maybe could you explain maybe with little more color your role are you looking at exploring new types of financing alternatives as kind of the composition of your portfolio slightly ships and would that be with some newer partners just trying to get a little bit of additional detail on how your role what your role really is moving into jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president so carter a couple of things i mentioned that we ve got sunstrong and hannon armstrong sustainable real estate these are platforms that are an evolution of our origination strategy we ve always talked about johnson controls having a master purchase agreement that s 20 years old and we just add new pages to it each year what we re doing with sunstrong hasire ph and a few other efforts are significantly more complex they are effectively joint ventures that are not as simple as adding another addendum to a master purchase agreement so in looking at how the business is evolving it s fantastic to have a great business person on staff who can really step into these ventures as a business person not not just a transact or not that we don t cherish our transactors but there is an experience that we need to bring to bear in these joint ventures because our clients are big companies and they have a load of staff we don t so it s good to have brendan now able to be our load of staff to match up with our clients and as you know his intellective is more than one persons so we ll just delighted to have him available now with lipson coming on board with that brendan do you want to expand on that j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president go ahead carter carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst i was going to say so i mean is it it s a deepening of relationships in a different form is that the right characterization or j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president i think it s part of that and i think the other two things that we ve talked about is as kind of goals is how do we capture more of this emerging market opportunity what is it and how do you capture it and then how do you do it in a more profitable way so i think those are kind of the three things i m going to be primarily focused on how can we continue to grow and capture and develop new niches either through partnerships or otherwise and how do we do it more profitably and enhance the business further carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst if you re successful is it reasonable to assume a higher level of roe over time j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president yes i think so jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president i hope so carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst just a quick follow up so in terms of like rate normalization do you have like a monitor that we could ourselves whether it s a inaudible commercial paper and some other long yielding instrument where you get some level of spread for some duration that would kind of tip the balance more toward on balance sheet versus securitization i mean are there effect of number of different metrics you utilize jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president yes we do the first thing we do on every management meeting on monday is look at interest rates spreads trends so on and so forth and so we look one of the things we look at is the inaudible so if you look at the curve now and we compare it against last week and against last year and you obviously see it s very flat and in some places it s actually inverted so we look at we look at that obviously we would like to see steepening we pay attention to what the fed says because they re the ones that determine things but also look at other sources so we look at a variety of things but from a curve flattened standpoint it s basically a inaudible carter driscoll b riley fbr inc analyst perfect thank you welcome aboard jeff and appreciate taking all my questions thanks guys jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you appreciate that operator we ll now take a question from david cater ph with baird david cater robert w baird co analyst hi guys thank you for taking the question quickly looking on guidance for next year and i don t want to get too ahead of ourselves after a strong quarter but can you talk about what happens to get you to the low end of guidance and the high end is that all volatility in gain on sale income and then maybe speaking more long term what can jump start eps growth rates in your view does it require a steepening in the yield curve or do you have what other levers do you have to kind of accelerate growth j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president you want to jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president yes so i think this is our last question brendan and this is your last inaudible j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president so good question david i didn t give you a blank look so i think yes gain on sale obviously has a big impact because that s variable and i think as we ve always talked we don t control closing so it s something slips to the right especially in a gain on sale has a much bigger impact on eps than if a one balance sheet transaction slips i think we can think we re continuing to do the right things in the business to set the business up for the future and to grow more we think that we re in this for the long haul as jeff said it s late cycle so we don t necessarily don t want to be in a situation where feel like we re reaching for things so it s a matter of being disciplined in how we approach it but we do think that there s lots of exciting opportunities so we re going to continue that discipline but also look for places where we can either grow origination or add more assets to the balance sheet or lower our cost of debt so i think those three things we ve always talked about how we grow earnings and growing earnings is new additional assets it s increasing the net interest income it s the continuing to work on our operating leverage and we still have i think a lot of ability to increase our finance leverage also so we continue to think and focus about those things and that s how we ll be able to continue to grow earnings above kind of what we said david cater robert w baird co analyst that s great thank you guys j brendan herron jr chief financial officer and executive vice president thank you jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you operator and it appears there are no further questions at this time i d like to turn the conference back to mr jeff eckel for any additional or closing remarks jeffrey w eckel chairman chief executive officer and president thank you once again you asked good questions we look forward to

conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area with the assistance of external legal and accounting advisors and found we should have recorded 25 million in prior periods which we booked in q4 2018 to be clear we do not expect this to be material to our current period or any prior period financial statements now let s turn to slide 2 and i will hand it over to bernardo bernardo hees chief executive officer thank you chris and good afternoon everyone with the closing of one year and the start of a new one i think it s best to begin our update today similar to how we do things internally with a scorecard to better understand where we delivered where we did not and why at this time last year we set plans to drive profitable sales and consumption growth by investing in deployment of new capabilities and a strong pipeline of innovation and white space initiatives and while we expected this to translate into near term margin pressure in united states and rest of the world segment we anticipated a stronger net savings to deliver constant currency ebitda growth for the year overall we successfully drove profitable sales and consumption growth accelerated but we fell short in delivering the net savings we expected from a commercial perspective we firmly restarted organic growth in united states our second half performance came back to offset the self inflicted losses from the first half of the year we became one of the few within our industry posting real volume driven growth growing volume mix nearly 4 in canada similar to united states we ended the year with positive consumption growth from improvements in coffee and cheese our emea business built momentum on the back of white space gains in condiments and encouraging share trends across our u k base in rest of the world we are gaining traction in driving real growth with the start up of our new inaudible plant in brazil and our cerebos acquisition in australia and new zealand and our foodservice business on a global basis is approaching 4 billion in sales and gaining momentum from white space initiatives in all markets and this leads to the second aspect of our scorecard the significant progress we made developing deploying a strategically advanced capabilities we have strong returns on investment in marketing category management and e store sales we continue to expand in e commerce and reach driving 79 channel growth in united states alone and a 1 10 ph market share index versus traditional retail and we setup springboard and evolv ventures as platforms to accelerate our innovation to consumers to customers and find new ways to disrupt ourselves so when you think about the sustainability of our growth breakthrough innovation a strong in store activity distribution gain and white space expansion are all coming together in fact our consumption turnaround in the united states had been driven by brand building initiatives across the portfolio not just a few categories we are sustaining momentum in brands where we ve been successful like heinz philadelphia oscar mayer bacon classico inaudible in our frozen snack category at large all growing mid single digits in 2018 turning around other key brands like kraft mac cheese oscar mayer hot dogs and a1 to low single digit growth after several years of decline stabilizing historically challenged brands like kraft salad dressing mayo and our kids single serve beverage business after years of mid single digit declines and building new brands into meaningful platforms of growth like inaudible which now 120 million platform devour a 7 million brand in less than three years and just crack an egg at 50 million after only 12 months while some of this was supported by incremental promotion and price investments to improve consumption and distribution trends we saw strong lois and created a solid base of support and commercial momentum for 2019 where we fell short in 2018 was operations specifically our entire ebitda miss was driven by net savings versus expectations within our united states supply chain to be fair we must first recognize that our team operate at industry leading levels globally in quality with top tier performance in the industry in safety with our best results ever and in customer service achieving industry leading case fill rates and on time in full delivery rates as we saw volumes ramp up the core cause of our shortfall in 2018 was forecasting the pace and magnitude of our savings curve in 2018 not merger related synergies and not an increase in ddb cost in fact ddb delivered savings across all of fixed cost packets outside of our commercial investments and helped to fund our initiatives to put our performance in context we started 2018 expecting approximately 3 growth inflation excluding key commodity costs with savings programs expected to offset gross inflation we ended the year with approximately 3 inflation net of savings specifically driven by higher supply chain costs and low operational savings in the united states there is no question we are disappointed that profitability did not ramp up with consumption gains as anticipated we are overly optimistic on delivering savings that did not materialize by year end for that we take full responsibility and we have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again by touching planning process procedures and organizational structure in the end we see three takeaways from 2018 one we re successfully driving sustainable consumption growth two we have the ability to deliver top tier organic growth at industry leading margins and three we need to better plan and execute our operational net savings initiatives before we outline the 2019 plans david will provide more details on our 2018 financials david knopf chief financial officer thank you bernardo and hello everyone as we show on slide 3 while our overall performance fell short of our expectations the year on year drivers are straightforward consumption driven growth negatively impacted by cost inflation net of savings in the u s with tax savings offsetting lower ebitda higher depreciation and interest expense from a trend perspective there are a few important details to highlight on the top line consumption driven growth momentum continued to build through q4 for total kraft heinz q4 volume mix growth was 4 with growth in every reporting segment driven by innovation marketing white space and go to market investments and led by improved consumption in a vast majority of u s categories total company q4 pricing was down 160 basis points including 80 basis points from key commodity pass through in the u s also note that the sequential decline in pricing versus q3 was accentuated by a deceleration in contribution from price in our rest of world segment and regarding u s pricing trends as bernardo mentioned we were happy with the returns and results on this front to provide more context and adjust for program timing it s useful to understand the key drivers of u s pricing from a second half perspective u s pricing in the second half of 2018 was down 2 4 percentage points with 1 point from passing through lower key commodity costs so u s pricing net of key commodity impacts was down 1 4 in the second half out of this 40 basis points of the decline was primarily related to defending our natural cheese business by closing freight debts to private label the remaining 1 point was a combination of opportunistic price investments in support of our innovation pipeline to stimulate incremental consumption with good lift and solid returns looking forward and excluding the impact of key commodity pass through we do not expect pricing to be down in 2019 either in the u s or globally moving to ebitda we said on our last call that we expected our ebitda growth rate to improve beginning in q4 while this turned out directionally accurate q4 constant currency adjusted ebitda was significantly below the expectations we previously outlined as bernardo mentioned this was driven by shortfalls in the united states to be more specific while the one off factors we outlined in q3 by and large fell away as expected anticipated savings did not materialize particularly in our procurement area and to a lesser extent we had higher than anticipated costs in both manufacturing and logistics taken together top line trends and bottom line results lead us to the key factors we considered over the past few months in finalizing our 2019 plans outlined on slide 4 and i ll hand it back to bernardo to start it off bernardo hees chief executive officer now it s time for us to focus on the year ahead what we see in front of us and how best to grow our business for the long term our industry has been and is likely to remain challenged on the forefront continued fragmentation of consumer demand a general lack of affordability to reinvesting brands retail competition where assortment is likely to grow in importance and finally in the short term ongoing cost inflation given our savings shortfall and the high inflation we re seeing we could focus on maintain or expanding margins but risk forfeiting commercial growth and market share by slowing our pace of innovation and channel development focusing on marketing efficiency versus incremental marketing presence and compromising talent development at a critical time we have not and we will not we are choosing to focus on improving our long term growth trajectory and returns by driving consumption and market share leveraging next generation capabilities for brand and categories advantage and importantly securing the right talent in areas critical to grow in fact in light of the industry backdrop we have concluded that there is no better time for kraft heinz to improve our growth profile and looking forward we have set three objectives for 2019 first leverage our industry leading margins to sustain our commercial momentum second more actively manage our portfolio and third expand ph our balance sheet as we continue to position kraft heinz for industry consolidation i will cover our commercial growth initiative and david will outline our portfolio capital restructure and financial expectations by far the biggest and the best thing you can do to build the long term value of our portfolio is to capture sustainable commercial growth by building on the sales momentum from 2018 and we have the stronger global pipeline we ever had to go after incremental consumer demand in the united states we ll be launching a record level of innovation improving base consumption velocities and leveraging brands and go to market investments in canada the priority is inaudible consumption in inaudible as well as sauces and condiments in europe and rest of the world markets white space initiatives will focus on driving incremental sauces consumption and opening new geographies and in foodservice all regions have significant opportunities to gain distribution and white space we will support these initiatives with fully funded brand programs taking advantage of our superior inaudible efficiency or cost per impression and increasing our immediate effectiveness or sales lift per impression by deploying new creative tools in digital marketing in a nutshell we plan to go to market in 2019 with a stronger innovation pipeline than we ever had backed by more marketing dollars while leveraging advantaged category managed and go to market initiatives to win assortment and improve distribution across all channels including e commerce and we plan to do this while we maintain industry leading margins now let me turn back to david as the remaining objectives are a big part of his 2019 goals david knopf chief financial officer i ll start with our financial expectations going forward on slide 6 regarding top line we are now well positioned to continue organic net sales growth driven by incremental consumption gains this will reflect volume mix growth from innovation distribution and white space initiatives and pricing actions that balance cost inflation and our market share objectives on pricing note that we exited 2018 at strong levels of merchandising support and distribution and price gaps are currently in a better place so we do not expect pricing to be a drag year on year for 2019 as a whole in fact our u s business recently announced list price increases that are scheduled to take effect late in q1 from an organic growth perspective in the very near term q1 is likely to decline versus the prior year due to unfavorable trade timing and a shift in easter related shipments to q2 this year from q1 last year trade timing in canada comparisons with a very strong winter soup season in the u k and destocking in asia pacific for the year we are targeting positive organic net sales growth with commercial gains partially offset by price elasticity and on a nominal basis a combination of currency headwinds and divestitures is likely to result in a 3 percentage points to 4 percentage point headwind to net sales regarding profitability we fully expect to maintain industry leading margins at the same time we think it s prudent to begin the year by properly level setting expectations to do so as a one off for 2019 we are breaking with our established guidance practices and setting a range for expected adjusted ebitda of 6 3 billion to 6 5 billion for this year this includes commercial gains offset by stepped up support of marketing innovation e commerce and people another year of low to mid single digit percentage non key commodity inflation net of cost savings as well as foreign exchange rates and the two divestitures already announced in addition we currently expect to begin 2019 with the first quarter that is likely to see a high teens decline in adjusted ebitda in percentage terms we will be up against our toughest ebitda comparisons for the year particularly in light of our expected net inflation curve stepped up commercial spending levels and with pricing not taking effect until late q1 finally at the eps line while we continue to believe that we can deliver top tier growth it will take hold from 2020 onwards this is because in addition to our ebitda outlook 2019 will see approximately 0 25 of non operating headwinds versus 2018 this will come from a combination of several factors 80 million of incremental depreciation expense a roughly 120 million reduction in the other income line mainly due to rising interest rates increasing pension interest costs and less favorable market returns on planned assets assumed versus 2018 approximately 40 million of additional interest expense and a full year effective tax rate between 20 and 22 taken together top line ebitda and eps drivers while we expect to take a step backwards in 2019 we remain confident in delivering consistent profit growth from 2020 onwards driven by fully leveraging our advantage brands cost structures and capabilities the rest of our plan is focused on how we can take additional steps to improve our portfolio s growth trajectory strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves against inorganic opportunities it starts with the potential for more active portfolio management specifically through divestitures as a way to further improve our growth and returns as well as accelerate our deleveraging the recent transactions we have announced india beverages and canada natural cheese provide a good template of precedent for additional actions to exit areas with no clear path to competitive advantage and sell assets with strong valuations with some earnings dilution we have now dedicated more resources adding experience with carlos piani fully focused on our portfolio management efforts and as we re able to execute such actions we will look to deleverage with the proceeds which leads to our next objective further strengthening our balance sheet i think it s important to first recognize that we have the capacity to drive industry leading cash generation along with industry leading margins and expect to hold existing working capital and capex levels even as we drive the growth agenda we ve outlined in addition given the industry backdrop and opportunities in front of us we now see even greater strategic advantage in accelerating or deleveraging toward our ongoing 3 times leverage target and strengthening the term structure of our debt to do this we re undertaking two specific actions first we intend to dedicate the divestiture proceeds from the sale of our india beverage and canada natural cheese businesses to debt reduction we also intend to do the same with proceeds from additional divestitures we are currently considering second today we re announcing a reduction in our quarterly dividend to 0 40 per share or 1 60 per year down from a rate of 2 50 per year this will not only provide us greater balance sheet flexibility it will also establish a base dividend that we can grow consistent with ebitda growth over time and we are comfortable that this level of dividend can accommodate the two divestitures we have already announced as well as those we are currently considering these initiatives will accelerate the strengthening of an already solid balance sheet with a fully funded pension plan and continue to position kraft heinz for industry consolidation now i ll turn it back to bernardo to close bernardo hees chief executive officer thank you david before we take your questions i think it s useful to put our progress to date our plans and priorities as well as our expectations beyond 2019 into context when we put kraft heinz together in mid 2015 our focus through 2017 was inaudible necessary product renovation and supply chain integration taking out cost that drops no benefit to our consumers establishing retool and routines and testing and learning new tools to adapt to a rapidly changing environment beginning 2018 and into 2019 we ll focus on leveraging our industry leading margins to establish key growth pillars through innovation and white space expansion accelerate the global deployment of advantage capabilities across all channels and geographies and now more actively managing our portfolio for better growth and returns from 2020 we expect to see growth on both the top and bottom lines at the full leverage of our advantage brands cost structure and investments close to the p l so to summarize we have continued to invest and focus on building our highly scalable operational model to position ourselves for sustainable organic growth and returns and doing so at a time when the need for industry to modernize and consolidate is more evident than it was five or even three years ago now we will be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question will come from the line of andrew lazar with barclays your line is open andrew lazar barclays analyst good afternoon everybody bernardo hees chief executive officer good afternoon andrew lazar barclays analyst i guess i ll kick it off with you mentioned i think david that you thought that there was an opportunity for greater strategic advantage i think were the words you used for greater divestiture activity today than previously i was hoping to get a little more clarity on what you meant by that is it a matter of just simply strengthening the balance sheet because you see more opportunities for more transformational deals now than you did before is it that valuation opportunities on those potential assets for sale are greater than maybe what you would have expected previously i m trying to get a better handle on that thank you bernardo hees chief executive officer hi andrew it s bernardo let me take this part of the question i think we re seeing a large technical difficulty in the industry and we are going through commercially a good momentum right with acceleration in consumption in share gains in volumes right also too that you re coming out of the integration we know more about the categories and the competitive advantage of each one of our brands than ever before so with that in mind our decision here was to execute the strategy on deleveraging faster so we can better position the company for future consolidation right as usual we inaudible than we are actually doing but as we did in the second half of last year we did divestiture of india beverage and the canadian natural cheese business i think it s a good framework for the things we are looking today and that s exactly the point there right now operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan spillane with bank of america your line is open bryan spillane bank of america analyst hi good afternoon everyone david knopf chief financial officer good afternoon bryan spillane bank of america analyst i guess two questions or two points i guess related to the i guess the build from through from the end of 18 through getting back to growth in 2020 one is just how much incremental investment is contemplated in your 2019 plan so how much more are you spending in addition of in terms of what you stepped up in 2018 and then second the visibility in your business has not been very good i think we ve experienced that here in the second half so i think it would be really helpful if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of sort of how you see a bridge to actually getting to some growth in 2020 thank you david knopf chief financial officer hi bryan thanks for the question this is david so let me step back for a second and i can break down our 2019 outlook a bit more and get a sense for our ebitda expectations year over year so overall we expect gains from consumption growth to be in line with the stepped up spending behind our initiatives so really the main drivers for the expected ebitda decline year over year are a few factors first the net inflation that we talked about that we expect to see again in 2019 the divestitures i talked about fx and to a lesser extent variable compensation so to be more specific if you assume the midpoint of our range or roughly 700 million decline year over year let me elaborate on the four main drivers behind that so first off on the commercial side again we should be neutral on the bottom line as we expect the positive contribution from further consumption gains to be in line with the stepped up investments as we accelerate the pace of our innovation base business performance and channel development second beyond that roughly half of the total ebitda decline or roughly 300 million to 400 million is driven by continued inflation net of cost savings in the low to mid single digit range consistent with what we saw in 2018 so this will be driven by another year of mid single digit growth low to mid single digit growth inflation excluding key commodities and given the recent experience actions we ve taken to replan the savings and pushing out the savings curve third we expect the combination of foreign exchange headwinds and the divestitures we ve already announced that should drive another 250 million headwind to adjusted ebitda versus 2018 and then finally we have an impact from variable compensation which is another roughly 80 million year over year so taking together this will put us where we saw the highest margin in the industry and we believe that is the right base to build from so to elaborate more on why we re confident even with the miss in expectations that we saw in q4 and the decline in ebitda that we re seeing in 2019 let me elaborate a little bit on why we re so confident in 2020 first on the top line we should be very well positioned for solid organic growth globally ok we re already seeing real consumption driven growth in the u s and globally today that we re able to create in the second half of 2018 and in 2019 we expect to further improve our consumption rate behind the largest innovation pipeline that we ve ever had and more support on the core business and we have a rapidly growing international business with significant exposure to emerging markets and white space opportunities to accelerate that growth globally at ebitda in 2019 we are spending ahead to support an even larger innovation pipeline than i mentioned and accelerating channel development particularly in e commerce so the right spending in commercial support levels capabilities and marketing will have been established this year in 2019 and then on the cost side the extraordinary inflation that we re seeing in 2018 and that we re now seeing in 2019 from things like tariffs and transportation should mitigate over time as we re starting to see in the spot markets today and we re also confident that we will be able to we ll be in a much stronger position to manage those costs through pricing in our savings curve going forward in 2020 and finally at eps our non operating below the line cost that i talked about should be at run rate levels so that we can leverage the organic growth into both ebitda and eps growth 2020 going forward bernardo hees chief executive officer bryan just to add to what david just said to the numbers we are seeing a strong consumption driven growth in our business today that we plan to accelerate and the base we re assessing for 2019 get us to the right metrics and kpis in all our key investments marketing innovation supply chain channels digital so with that base we are very confident as we grow the business in 2019 and 20 that eps and ebitda grows together with that perspective operator our next question comes from the line of ken zaslow with bmo your line is open ken zaslow bmo analyst hi good evening everybody bernardo hees chief executive officer hi ken ken zaslow bmo analyst i have one question what are the key changes that will take place to change the planning and execution of the savings so we can become more so they can become more reliable and kind of put it into a better action are they going to be management changes is it going to be a change to the methodology oversight can you talk about that david knopf chief financial officer hi ken thanks for the question this is david so again let me step back for a second and kind of walk through our q4 performance versus our original expectations provide a little more context and then i ll hand it over to bernardo to provide a little more color on what we re doing differently to make sure this doesn t happen on the q3 call we did expect q4 ebitda growth to improve sequentially as i talked about versus the 14 year over year inaudible saw in q3 ok and that assumption was based on the fact that we expected transitory headwinds and one offs in q3 that would fall away which would effectively bring our run rate growth to more of a high single digit decline year over year and then on top of that we expected savings to accelerate leading to a significant sequential improvement from q3 to q4 obviously in the end the transitory one off factors did fall away as expected but we have three negative impacts in the quarter that we didn t expect first we had roughly a 3 5 percentage point impact of unanticipated cost headwinds which i can explain further second we did we didn t have any anticipated savings curve that we expected to materialize in the quarter to partially offset the inflation we re seeing and then finally we did have an incremental fx drag of about 1 5 percentage points in q4 versus q3 so given all these factors the year on year decline in q4 is much closer than q3 and we didn t see the sequential improvement with that i ll hand it over to bernardo to answer your other question bernardo hees chief executive officer ken i think it s a very fair point and even though we re disappointed with the miss that s pretty much focused like david said in the supply chain operations in united states we did took ph several actions to not allow this to happen again right actions in the planning process in organizational structure and position ourselves to make sure our savings curve really match right the timing and the effectiveness for the year so inaudible we understand the reasons of the miss and we saw in the q4 higher cost and more volumes coming to the pipe and we could not offset to timing of our savings curve we did took ph actions process planning and structure to not repeat that again ken zaslow bmo analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dara mohsenian with morgan stanley your line is open dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon guys bernardo hees chief executive officer good afternoon dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst could you first just for clarification can you provide a bit more detail on the circumstances behind the sec subpoena on the procurement side it sounds like it originated externally as opposed to finding something internally so just curious for the circumstances there and then on the pricing front you mentioned increases in the u s by the end of q1 can you give us a rough idea of what percentage of your business that represents and given we ve seen the price gap move up versus private label in a lot of your key product categories in the u s over the last few years do you think there might need to be a broader reset of price gaps at some point particularly with the market share momentum we re seeing at private label thanks david knopf chief financial officer hi this is david thanks for the question so i ll answer the first part of your question and then hand it over to paulo to u s pricing in the u s so the company was notified by the sec regarding an investigation into the company s procurement area following this we conducted a very thorough internal investigation with the support of an independent law firm and accounting firm and we determined that we should have recorded 25 million in prior periods which we booked in q4 2018 and to put it into context that compares to our overall procurement spend of over 11 billion which excludes big four commodity spend so this misstatement was not material for our current or prior year financial statements and finally we did implement several improvements internal controls and took remedial measures to mitigate the likelihood that this happens again so with that i ll hand it over to paulo to address pricing paulo luiz basilio unit president thanks dave let me start from the answering the private label question and then we can we move to the 2019 pricing while we re seeing the private label expanding and it s doing so at a more we are seeing this happening in a more restrained pace around 0 2 points of share in q4 it was a material step down from previous quarters that we re seeing and we are seeing the most pressure is mainly in areas where low commodities excess capacity and with competition come together mostly in our in some subsegments of our cheese portfolio in natural cheese we see also the retailers have used price matching to drive traffic and we re being able to invest back that was part of our price investment we d had in the second half to narrow the price gaps and after that we saw branded and private label share starting to stabilize so again we re always monitoring the value proposition of the market and where inaudible innovate and differentiate our brands and products on that matter when you think about 2019 pricing we already have announced our pricing we did an analysis in terms of to define the right part of the portfolio that we are pricing being very cautious about the balance between sales and cost to provide the best value equation and helping to drive category growth and we are seeing already announced we this thing is going to take effect in q1 and we expect overall our overall pricing to turn positive over the course of 19 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with jpmorgan your line is open ken goldman jpmorgan analyst hi thanks so much bernardo as you know one of the bare thesis over the years on the 3g philosophy has been that i guess the intense cost saving efforts will over the long run sort of erode brand equities and i realize you ve had a better top line lately but one could argue it took 300 million spending infusion to get there and i think more importantly you took a 15 billion writedown on two of your biggest brands kraft and oscar mayer and to me that literally means the brand equity there aren t what they used to be so when investors are looking at the consistent financial disappointments at kraft maybe even bring inaudible into the discussion and if they ask why is the 3g belt tightening strategy goes too far and that could damage brands is there at least some evidence starting to point to yes there i m just curious for your thoughts on that bernardo hees chief executive officer hi ken let david talk about the impairment here that you just mentioned then i come back here to talk about the model that s what is implicit in your question here thanks for that david can you start david knopf chief financial officer thanks bernardo so in terms of the impairment the writedown was primarily reflected it reflected revised margin expectations and this was for really three businesses of ours first the kraft natural cheese business second our oscar mayer cold cuts business where we talked about issue that we had in the first part of the year and then third our canada retail business and really the fundamental driver behind the reduction in expectations was driven by our second half performance ok which was primarily driven by supply chain issues that we had in the cost side as you know and then just to provide a little more context since the merger we ve also seen significant pressure on valuations from a higher discount rate come into play which was partially offset technical difficulty taxes but that s really the context around the impairment and i ll hand over to bernardo to answer the rest of your question bernardo hees chief executive officer ken look we still believe in and strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future right first let s remember we continue to create with a leading industry margins right and now we are growing right at the same level as the top tier companies redeem similar portfolio right so that s very important inaudible perspective second the niche we have and we re acknowledging here properly has been focused on operations supply chain in united states the commercial momentum with consumption growth continue to accelerate inaudible we think that s inaudible we re doing since 2018 now 2019 we can say we have the right base to be growing through consumption volumes and share at the same time maintaining high leading ph margins to the industry into 2020 like david highlighted to the inaudible numbers right we do believe to that base we have been in a very solid position to be growing top line and bottom line not only that we are working more actively the portfolio and now with the reduction of the dividend allowed us to have more flexibility in our balance sheet to really deleverage faster and position ourselves to more consolidation in the future that we believe is necessary and will happen with that model and so we are confident in the things we re doing even though we acknowledge we did have the miss in the fourth quarter like highlighted by david ken goldman jpmorgan analyst can i ask a very quick follow up david and bernardo thank you for that that s helpful david knopf chief financial officer yes please ken goldman jpmorgan analyst david i think you mentioned that it was more of a short term like the last couple of quarter issue with the two brands and maybe discount rates have risen the companies generally don t take writedowns because recent performance was bad and because discount rates have risen isn t there something broader and longer term that usually leads to these kind of impairments david knopf chief financial officer yes that s a great question and thanks for that just to be clear by far and away the majority of the impairment which was really concentrated in these three businesses that i mentioned it was by far and away driven by the second half performance and the new level of margin and profitability that we re talking about versus what it was before so the margin profile and what we established in the second half was really the key driver behind the impairment ken goldman jpmorgan analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi your line is open david driscoll citi analyst great thank you and good evening bernardo hees chief executive officer good evening david driscoll citi analyst i just had a couple of questions but i think they re reasonably short can you give us some sense of the size of the assets that you wish to sell that haven t been announced would it be something like on the magnitude of 5 of the revenue base and then i had a question about the savings programs i think you made a statement david in your script that in the forecast the savings programs had been quote unquote pushed out so i m a little confused as to kind of why that s happening and why can t you achieve the internal savings at the same time that you re generating the revenue performance and then related to that if you didn t hit the savings that you expected in the fourth quarter don t those savings programs show up in like the first quarter of 19 or second quarter of 19 i mean i don t think there s a they shouldn t disappear but it feels like within the guidance that they did and i just may be don t understand what s happened right there thank you bernardo hees chief executive officer hi david it s bernardo let me address the first part of the question we re not discussing here size or so what we re saying that we will work our portfolio to strengthen our balance sheet as we re doing with the dividend to have more flexibility for future consolidations as we see it as david said our objective is to deleverage right to 3 times in the middle term at a faster pace than we re doing today with that and then all that you have in the portfolio today with our competitive advantage by brands and category allowed us to be in a very good position to understand the magnitude that what we can do or we cannot do i don t want to elaborate more than we are doing right now with that david can you open again the 18 and 19 to clarify here to david david knopf chief financial officer hi david this is david thanks for the question so on the savings side we were overly optimistic on our ability to offset significant inflation in the quarter and again that drove a significant part of the miss so the savings miss was really a combination of two things underdelivery from supplier negotiations and delayed manufacturing projects and to give you a little bit of color on what some of those projects were like they included line optimizations yield improvements and assumed even better performance on some of our footprint plans that we discussed previously so because of this miss as bernardo said we took significant action to address our processes planning and structure internally and simultaneously spent a lot of time and focus really revisiting our savings projects and we replanned as a function of that our savings curve is being pushed out as we implement those changes as we revisit our savings programs going forward so that s really what s driving the delay in the savings curve and that s embedded in my 2019 expectations david driscoll citi analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jason english with goldman sachs your line is open jason english goldman sachs analyst hello good evening folks thank you for squeezing me in bernardo hees chief executive officer good evening jason english goldman sachs analyst your guidance for next year suggests that the majority of the synergies you realized on consolidating heinz and kraft will have effectively been wiped out in that context i d love to hear your thought process and rationale on continuing to pursue a strategy of consolidation where do you see the value creation coming from this would certainly suggest that maybe there s not as much opportunity as someone maybe once envisioned david knopf chief financial officer hi thanks for the question this is david so since the merger ebitda has been held back by more than 1 billion versus what we had really kind of set out for and within that we had nearly 0 5 billion of costs that we put back into the business ok these are costs that are different and independent from the cost that we took out in the integration right so most of the synergies and the integration savings that we captured were non consumer non commercial related cost savings ok so the synergies that we realized are very much intact the costs that we put in are squarely within different areas and we re putting costs in that are consumer facing and drives commercial growth ok so these are things like expanding our innovation pipeline our go to market infrastructure in the u s and international our digital and e commerce capabilities and while there s a significant amount of investment we put behind us we are starting to see the returns which is why we re growing in the second half on top of that we also had significant amount of fx headwinds that also affected our sales and ebitda trajectory and then finally the inflation and the inability to executing it to savings curve as we talked about that with that i ll hand it over to bernardo to address as well bernardo hees chief executive officer jason i actually as dave said the investments we re doing and the things we re doing are not correlated to the savings we got through the merger that will be still here and inaudible more as the year goes i actually would say the opposite i think we are more prepared with the capabilities and we are more ready for industry consolidation to better performance in the future than we were two three or five years ago to that sense i think we re having more firepower with a better balance sheet profile is important jason english goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael lavery with piper jaffray your line is open michael lavery piper jaffray analyst good evening david knopf chief financial officer good evening michael lavery piper jaffray analyst just wanted to understand you mentioned your that you should be measured on organic growth and that hasn t come through the way i think people might have expected but i think there s been forgiveness around that because you are deal guys and technical difficulty about the outlook bernardo hees chief executive officer michael i m sorry you faded a bit there we didn t quite hear the question michael lavery piper jaffray analyst multiple speakers deal driven christopher jakubik head of investor relations michael could you repeat the question you kind of faded there a little bit michael lavery piper jaffray analyst yeah sorry no problem you ve said a couple of years ago that you should be measured on organic growth for your business and that obviously has had some struggles you re also known as deal guys but we haven t seen a deal yet either can you just help us understand why somebody should be excited about the prospects from here is it a deal that you know you can get done is it organic growth or is it a combination bernardo hees chief executive officer hi lavery it s bernardo again look i think if you see the second half performance of our commercial initiatives and returns of our investment it s going to see a very positive scenario in that sense right we re having volumes consumption and market share gains in the vast majorities of our categories even categories that have been declining for quite some time are seeing a momentum right and we do know there is more to come not only that even with the miss of the fourth quarter we continue to operate at industry leading margins and we think the 2019 base that david just highlight is a base we can grow sales and ebitda going forward with the actions we are taking on dividend and the work we re doing in the portfolio is to manage to be successful and we are confident we can be we will have a balance sheet that s more flexible and more prepared for future consolidation so in that sense i think the commercial momentum is happening in that sense i think even with the miss in u s operations we still have the base of the margin here that allows us from this base to build 2020 and beyond and the balance sheet flexibility for future consolidation for us to be a consolidator if the industry goes our way operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob moskow with credit suisse your line is open robert moskow credit suisse analyst hi thank you for the question bernardo i had a question about the supply chain it was a you had very poor order fill rates i think a year or two ago you had issues in frozen potatoes you had issues with sliced lunch meat and now this year we re having more supply chain issues and the commentary that there s some cost savings going on in the supply chain i m still i guess uncomfortable with it because it indicates that maybe you need to try to make it more efficient it sounds like you need a bigger investment in the supply chain maybe you need to expand the footprint increase flexibility and increase capabilities is there going to be a big dollar investment in people and in the footprint that s necessary as part of this rebase thanks bernardo hees chief executive officer thanks rob for the question no actually i think it s important to understand what did not happen in the fourth quarter was this ramp up of the savings right we are in the same level of the third quarter and actually let me put perspective a little bit to what you said we came into 2018 as one of the best service provider in the industry our on time and in full inaudible like we said in the original highlight is really now at top quartile worldwide so in that sense the whole investment in footprint right capacity and service is already behind us do we have more we always have things to do and improve but to the base that you re asking it s actually the opposite we did believe there was more saved timing on the savings curve and that for that we are taking full responsibility that did not materialize and they will come to life in 2019 20 and beyond but there is no bigger investment in supply chain to your point because i m operating better or in the same level of the third quarter with one of the best service in united states today with that said let me pass over to paulo to detail the supply chain cost here in the united states paulo luiz basilio unit president hi rob this is paulo so no i just want to reaffirm here what bernardo was saying that 2018 was a great year for supply chain in terms of service think about the four pillars of supply chain quality safety service and cost it s completely fair to say that our supply chain delivered very well three of the four pillars quality safety and a great service to support the strong volume that we had in the year in cost we all inaudible we are not able to deliver the additional saves we expect and then we had we ended up having more inflation also inaudible expecting the end of the year robert moskow credit suisse analyst okay i ll follow up later thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel your line is open chris growe stifel analyst hi good evening bernardo hees chief executive officer good evening chris growe stifel analyst hi i have two questions for you a real quick one would be just to be clear on the 250 million of ebitda pressure from divestitures does that include incorporate what s already happened or would also could happen going forward and if i could just ask a second question in relation to a comment you make in the release about your return on investment being strong in the fourth quarter and the year obviously if you measured that based on market share or even top line growth that s a fair comment but the degree of profit that it took to achieve that growth is quite significant and i think it would really weigh on that overall calculation of that of return on investment so i just want to get a better sense of how you re measuring your return on investment as you call it and how to think about that going forward given the extreme cost in this quarter thank you david knopf chief financial officer hi chris this is david thanks for the question so i ll answer the first part and then hand it over to paulo to address your second so the 250 million you mentioned approximately 70 million of that is related to the divestitures that we ve made to date ok and then the remaining amount is really the fx headwinds that we re seeing in some of our international markets so this does not include any future divestitures that we re considering it only includes the divestitures that we ve executed today the two deals that bernardo mentioned earlier paulo luiz basilio unit president hi so i m going to talk a little bit about the pricing and the return on the pricing investment that we had here if you consider if you think about our second half as a whole ok and you consider that actually we invested 1 in price when you exclude the impact from commodity and the 0 4 that we invested specifically to close the gap in the natural cheese and you see the performance in volume that we had growing almost 4 i think it s clear to see that even though this was only it was not the only lever of the volume improvement you can see that we have a very strong return on this particular investment but also it s important to say that our volume improvement was also supported by the much better service level as we re talking a strong innovation and launches renovation and additional brand and channel support besides the high level of store activity and promotions that we are inaudible here operator thank you and this concludes today s question and answer session i d now like to turn the call back to mr chris jakubik for closing remarks christopher jakubik head

financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted operating income loss adjusted net income loss and adjusted income loss per share diluted to provide useful supplemental information to assist investors in understanding and assessing our performance and financial results on the same basis that management uses internally these adjusted financial measures provide investors greater transparency with respect to the key metrics used by management to evaluate our core operations forecast future results determine future capital investment allocations and understand business trends within the industry adjusted operating income loss and adjusted income loss per share diluted metrics are also used by our board of directors to determine incentive compensation for future periods management believes the adjusted financial measures assist investors in the comparison of financial results between periods as such measures exclude certain items that management believes are not reflective of our core operating performance consistent with how management reviews the business these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of travelport s results as reported under u s gaap adjusted net income loss adjusted income loss per share diluted adjusted operating income and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or net income loss per share diluted as determined under u s gaap in addition these measures may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies we believe adjusted income loss per share diluted is a useful measure for our investors as it represents on a per share basis our consolidated results taking into account depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense excluding unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivative instruments certain components of net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs and related income taxes but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses adjusted income loss per share diluted has similar limitations as adjusted net income loss adjusted operating income loss and adjusted ebitda and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies in addition adjusted net income loss does not include all items that affect our net income loss and net income loss per share for the period therefore we believe it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated condensed statements of operations we believe our important measure of liquidity is free cash flow this measure is a useful indicator of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity demands we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our operating liquidity we believe it typically presents an alternate measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of our ongoing operations and it provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our platform we believe free cash flow provides investors with an understanding of how assets are performing and measures management s effectiveness in managing cash free cash flow is a non gaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies this measure has limitation in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the

of the board president and chief executive officer thanks stefanie and thank you all for joining us today pinnacle west delivered a solid 2018 with earnings near the top of our guidance range constructive public policy outcomes and a balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry jim will discuss the financial results my comments will focus on our 2018 highlights and the year ahead our fleet performed well in 2018 palo verde generating station completed another outstanding year of carbon free electricity production generating 31 1 million megawatt hours of energy it is also notable that the team at palo verde completed the scheduled 2018 spring refueling and maintenance outage in 28 days and 13 hours the shortest in palo verde history turning to our generation needs in 2018 we issued a request for proposal for approximately 106 megawatts of battery storage to be located on up to five of our az sun sites based upon our evaluation of the rfp responses we expanded the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 megawatts by adding a sixth az sun site which is expected to be in service by mid 2020 this investment will allow customers to use energy from our existing az sun solar facilities during the peak period after the sun sets increases fuel savings for customers and further advances our clean energy portfolio goals in addition we have entered into purchase power agreements for over 600 megawatts of peaking capacity resources beginning in 2021 these contracts are the result of our 2018 peaking capacity rfp and include 150 megawatts of battery storage and a 463 megawatt summer seasonal natural gas power purchase agreement looking forward we will continue our efforts to meet future customer needs with clean technologies advertisement advertisement to accomplish this we plan to install at least 660 megawatts of aps owned solar plus battery storage and stand alone battery storage systems by the summer of 2025 we expect to procure the first 260 megawatts in 2019 when added to our current commitments we expect to invest in a total of 950 megawatts of clean technology by 2025 in addition to our investment in generation resources needed to support customer growth i d like to highlight two other examples of capital investments benefiting customers first we installed an additional transformer near four corners increasing our ability to meet rising demand for wheeling services the total project cost was 25 million invested from 2016 through 2018 we received 12 million in additional transmission revenue after placing the transformer in service in 2018 customers will benefit from lower rates going forward as a result of our increased ability to offer these services the second investment is located in the west valley we continue to see new companies building out on the west side of phoenix to support this growth we plan to invest 100 million to construct a new west valley service center that is expected to be completed in 2022 turning to the regulatory front in january the arizona corporation commission voted to conduct a review of aps 2018 books and records to determine whether the 2017 rate review order was implemented properly and whether aps has earned more than its allowed rate of return in our opinion reviewing aps 2018 books and records is a constructive way for the commission to complete its due diligence and gain confidence in the outcome of our last rate review we appreciate the commission s commitment to understanding the facts and we ll be providing the commission staff with the information they need to complete the review by the may 3rd deadline we re confident the rate increase was implemented appropriately consistent with the rate review order as jim will discuss our 2018 arizona jurisdictional return on equity was 9 5 which is less than the authorized 10 return on equity the commission has also opened a docket to evaluate retail competition in arizona there are numerous legal challenges consumer issues and logistical challenges with implementing retail competition for example implementation would require an amendment to the arizona constitution given the challenges we believe it would be very difficult to implement retail competition in arizona as things stand today however there is always value in exploring different options and understanding the spectrum of possible opportunities we appreciate the commission s interest in understanding the negative impacts retail competition has had on residential customers in other states two other important items in front of the commission are the four corners scr step increase request and a request to return an additional 86 5 million in tax savings to customers on november 27th of 2018 the administrative law judge issued a recommended opinion and order consistent with the commission staff s proposed 58 47 million revenue increase we expect a decision on the scr step increase request and the tax refund request in early 2019 for our company we believe 2019 will be a productive year with our strategic priorities centered around clean energy affordability and reliability we recognize that achieving success in our corporate strategic initiatives will only happen through our people putting our people first and prioritizing development has been at the forefront i m pleased to highlight the recent promotion of jeff guldner previously our executive vice president of public policy to his new position as president of aps advertisement advertisement jeff is a strong and thoughtful leader with a deep understanding of the complex issues facing our industry i know that under his leadership the company will be well positioned to meet the challenges presented by a growing arizona and i look forward to working closely with jeff to lead our company forward in summary we delivered on our commitments in 2018 and are well positioned for 2019 and the long term we have clear priorities and a strong leadership team in place to achieve our goals we remain focused on creating value in our core business while delivering on our financial and operational commitments i ll now turn the call over to jim james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you don and thank you again everyone for joining us today this morning we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 as you can see on slide 3 of the materials we had a successful year before i review the details of our 2018 results let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter which can be found on slide 4 for the fourth quarter of 2018 we earned 0 23 per share compared to 0 19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted gross margin was down 0 15 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 higher sales related revenue and the change in residential rate design and seasonal rates were more than offset by the unfavorable weather and the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform as a reminder the 2017 rate review order established new rate options for customers advertisement advertisement the new rates shifted a portion of the revenue previously collected during the summer to non summer months better aligning revenue collection with the cost to serve offsetting the decrease in adjusted gross margin were lower operating and maintenance expenses higher pension and other post retirement benefits non service credits other income and lower adjusted income tax expense for the full year of 2018 we delivered solid results with earnings at the upper end of our guidance range earning 4 54 per share compared to 4 35 per share in 2017 reflected in these results is an acc jurisdictional roe of 9 5 when we calculated the acc jurisdictional roe we excluded revenue related to ferc jurisdiction ferc represents approximately 17 of rate base and has an authorized roe of 10 75 turning your attention to slide 5 i ll review some highlights of our full year results gross margin was a key driver during the year with a few core components the rate increase that went into effect on august 19th 2017 contributed 0 69 per share however increases in operating expenses offset a portion of the benefit to gross margin transmission revenue added 0 18 per share due in part to the addition of new long term wheeling agreements the lfcr added incremental growth to our gross margin of 0 02 per share higher sales related revenue added 0 16 per share to gross margin in 2018 driven by customer growth and higher average effective prices offsetting drivers included the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform and unfavorable weather looking next to operating expense operations and maintenance expense was up in 2018 compared to 2017 decreasing earnings by 0 50 per share primarily due to higher cost at aps for planned outages transmission and distribution and customer service costs information technology and the parent level higher public outreach costs higher depreciation and amortization expense decreased earnings 0 33 per share in 2018 as compared to 2017 the increase was primarily related to plant additions and the 61 million annual increase in d a rates approved in the 2017 rate order other taxes were higher in 2018 relative to 2017 reflecting higher property values and the impact related to the amortization of our property tax deferral as part of the 2017 rate order pension and other post retirement benefits non service credits increased pre tax income by approximately 25 million or 0 17 per share in 2018 compared to 2017 the increase was primarily related to higher market returns in 2017 and the adoption of new pension and opeb accounting guidance in 2018 lastly the refund to customers resulting from federal tax reform was offset by a lower effective tax rate as illustrated in more detail on slide 13 the net effect of adjusted net income including the benefits of federal corporate tax cuts offset by non deductible costs and other items decreased earnings 0 08 per share as you know arizona s economy continues to be an integral part of our investment thesis i ll cover some of the trends we are seeing in our local economy now looking to slide 6 metro phoenix continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average in 2018 employment in metro phoenix increased 3 3 compared to 1 6 for the entire us job growth remained strong in the construction and manufacturing sectors a sign of strength in the regional economy construction employment increased by 11 5 in 2018 and manufacturing employment increased by 5 9 we expect a continuation of business expansion and the related job growth to continue to support commercial and economic development advertisement advertisement the metro phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward post recession trend in 2018 we expect a total of 30 000 housing permits an increase of about 4 200 compared to 2017 driven by single family permits in 2019 we expect a total of 34 000 permits continuing the upward trend we have seen since the end of the recession we believe that solid job and income growth and relatively low mortgage rates should allow the metro phoenix housing market and the economy more generally to continue to expand faster than the national average reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions aps retail customer base grew 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1 7 for the entire year we expect that this growth rate will continue to accelerate in response to the economic growth trends i just discussed importantly the long term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in arizona appear to be in place and we believe phoenix should remain one of the country s fastest growing large metropolitan areas switching to our financing activity on december 21st pinnacle west entered into a 150 million term loan facility that matures in december 2020 the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes in 2019 we expect to issue up to 950 million of long term debt at aps overall liquidity remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter pinnacle west had 76 million in short term debt outstanding and aps had no short term borrowings outstanding a quick note on pension the funded status of our pension remains healthy at 90 as of year end 2018 this was largely due to the continued success of our liability driven investment strategy which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status turning to our earnings guidance and financial outlook as shown on slide 7 we expect pinnacle west consolidated earnings for 2019 to be in the range of 4 75 to 4 95 per share a complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance is in the appendix to our slides we have extended our capital expenditures and rate base forecast through 2021 on slides 8 and 9 we anticipate aps capital investment to be around 1 5 billion in 2021 driven by investments in clean energy infrastructure to support our customer growth and grid modernization in closing 2018 was another great year for pinnacle west we delivered earnings at the top of our guidance range and increased our dividend for the seventh straight year 2019 is off to a great start with the announcement of the 950 megawatts of additional clean technologies and growth in the west valley our growth in clean energy investments are just a couple of examples supporting our long term rate base growth outlook of 6 to 7 this concludes our prepared remarks i ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions at this time we ll go first to ali agha with suntrust your line is open and ali your line is open please go ahead advertisement advertisement ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yes hello good morning donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning ali ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst can you hear me first question on the four corner step increase i thought originally that was to have happened by the beginning of the year any reason for the delay in that and does that in any way impact your 19 guidance depending on when that does actually take place jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company yes ali this is jeff so the recommended opinion in order is out on the scr increase it has not gone to the commission yet it s possible that that could push out to when they re further into the rate audit and so that is just under way right now and it doesn t have an impact on guidance advertisement advertisement donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no we re very comfortable with the guidance ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst so assuming this happens around may time period that should still be fine with the guidance jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company yes ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay secondly on the rate base cagr so if i just took the 17 through 21 numbers that you re showing us that cagr is closer to 8 so just wanted to reconcile that with the 6 to 7 that you have on the same chart fair to say that at least for the next three four years we are running at a faster pace on that advertisement advertisement i see and then lastly just on the funding note there s obviously a pretty big step up in capex in 21 19 and 20 are pretty robust as well so can you just remind us where the equity needs show in and when external equity would be required to fund that and roughly how much how should we be thinking about that for modeling purposes james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer so any equity we issue would not necessarily be for 21 capex but it would be more related to the capital structure at aps and we will need to top that off at some point this year and if it isn t in the form of equity it would be a modest amount ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i see so think about that sometime later this year james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer if we did anything it would be later this year ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it thank you operator we ll move next to julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning can you hear me donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst so perhaps on a little bit on ali s questions first let me start where he left off on the capex front can you just elaborate a little bit 21 is obviously the first year of higher capex you talk about this 2019 rfp of 260 megawatts is that the full amount reflected in 21 and i just want to understand a little bit and i acknowledge we re early on how the cadence of that rfp could play out into subsequent years and again under the assumption that you own this and the other little piece if you could address is we haven t seen too many storage projects in utility ownership yet how are you thinking about the dollar per kilowatt capital cost here right i e the number of hours etcetera the parameters if you will donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so i think in terms of what we have announced to date the accommodation of ppa and ownership as we move forward we re more inclined to ownership but the rfps will dictate what we do as well as cost moving forward julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay fair enough but the 260 megawatts is that fully baked into 2021 itself i mean is there some that leads into bleeds into 22 and then separately i presume that you re assuming that you ve got you ve got the 260 megawatts in your outlook or is there some hair cutting of that donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer we have in the outlook what is to expected to incur by 2021 yes julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it okay excellent and just to come back to the four corners side of the equation real quickly obviously sales are oriented toward the summer is there anything further in terms of the timeline here that would give the acc some need or requirement to kind of vote on that thing james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer no not a requirement julien but yes it s the rate audit right now is scheduled to go through may 3rd julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it but is there any reason to link one versus the other obviously i mean they are separate and distinct in efforts here there s no reason to think they re going to wait for that james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer they are separate right but one of the things they are looking at is whether there was overearning in 2018 donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer and we feel that once the commissioners have the information in their hand they ll make an informed decision julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it all right excellent i ll leave it there thank you very much operator we ll move next to insoo kim with goldman sachs insoo kim goldman sachs analyst thank you regarding the upsized weather normalized load growth assumption from 19 to 21 i think my understanding is that that s the impact of the distributor generation impact coming off and maybe some less of the energy efficiency investments that should more align customer growth with load growth especially on the ee side have you seen have you been seeing the effects of customer education to use more power at the off peak hours it seems like the upside growth kind of depends on the changes in customer behavior on usage jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company i would say that s an impact on really prices realized and not inaudible consumed i think what we saw was a very strong fourth quarter with 0 3 growth and we re beginning to see the economic activity in the west valley which is what we ve been talking about for a couple years begin to come to fruition i will say meter sets which are a leading indicator exceeded budget in january for the first time in a long time so we re seeing now the realization of this economic activity happening insoo kim goldman sachs analyst so that when you look at the changes in customer growth outlook that moderated down about 0 5 on average annually but the load growth went up so that would assume that the usage per customer whether it s retail or residential or commercial that is expected to pick up donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s correct insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it and then in regards to the clean energy investments including storage would that be need to go through a rate case for recovery or are there contemplations on potential mechanisms to cover the costs and earn a return during the construction donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so the ppa construct would go through a procedure to get it into the psa the rate base will be recovered in normal course over time insoo kim goldman sachs analyst inaudible rate case right donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes insoo kim goldman sachs analyst understood thank you very much james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you insoo operator we ll go next to charles fishman with morningstar research charles fishman morningstar research analyst the questions i have are concerning slide 8 the capital expenditure and specifically the new bar 2021 is the increase in coal generation is that a little less than 200 million between 21 and 20 is that the expansion of the battery program james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer yes that would be battery and as well as utility scale solar charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay and then that new distribution center in west phoenix that you mentioned where does enter in on the bars what year we re at james r hatfield executive vice president and chief financial officer the activity for it is occurred some in 18 and will occur in 19 in 20 and 21 the infrastructure for the west valley will be ongoing charles fishman morningstar research analyst roughly how much i envision that as a facility for your distribution trucks and people and things is that am i picturing that correctly daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company yes charles this is daniel froetscher yes that is facility to be used for predominantly our transmission and distribution teams it s located in the west valley sits on about an 88 acre parcel it s a multi year build that will total roughly 85 million to 90 million charles fishman morningstar research analyst got it okay that s all i had thank you operator we ll move next to michael weinstein with credit suisse michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey so the irp that filing that s coming up in the spring is book how much more of the how much more capex can we expect to see or how much of an early indication is the 2021 bump in capex as to how this irp is going to be shaping up and how many more years of view ph do you think we ll get out of that at that point daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company michael this is daniel froetscher i wouldn t correlate necessarily our preliminary irp which is due a little later this year to 2021 and beyond we obviously haven t forecast the capex beyond 2021 i think the irp will foundationally serve as a forward look shaping mechanism relative to our resource requirements and our desired resource choices for additional capacity in energy michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you and are you getting any kind of indication from commissioner kennedy as to her desire for renewables at this point is she i m just curious about what kind of talks you ve had with the new commissioners jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company michael this is jeff so commissioner kennedy when she came on the bench indicated that she was going to propose or was talking about a 50 renewable energy standard by 2028 and so that s what we ve heard from her commissioner tobin as you can recall has a proposal for 80 clean standard and so we expect there will be some dialog at the commission around those various proposals michael weinstein credit suisse analyst do you think that will be entering into the draft irp jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company well the irp so the irp is going to certainly intersect that at some point so it s a little hard to tell how exactly all that s going to ultimately unfold but obviously if you file an irp and they re having some discussion around those potential standards they re going to intersect michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you okay thank you operator we ll go next to paul patterson with glenrock associates paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so was wondering with this increase in retail sales and i apologize if i missed this when is the next time you guys expect to go into for a rate case ali agha suntrust robinson humphrey analyst right now our expectation is to file june 1 of 2020 paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then with respect to the discussion around competition what do you think is driving that i mean i hear you guys arguments on how it doesn t really work for most rate payers but what do you think is driving the sort of i m old enough to remember when this first came up what do you think is causing this new interest jeffrey b guldner president arizona public service company paul i think that as certainly you saw in nevada there was a push there there is still discussions that i think occur around the country periodically it has been a topic in arizona kind of off and on for a while we continue to see the challenges as don mentioned in his comments the legal framework here in arizona is constitutionally grounded and so that makes it more challenging to implement something here but again the conversations in terms of what our customer is realizing in her states what are the challenges being confronted in other states those are all good conversations to have and we will share our viewpoints on that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay with respect to the battery and solar combination how should we think about sort of what that how that compares in terms of cost and flexibility to a gas plant if such a comparison can be made or what kind of capacity value can we sort of should we think about with the combination of these things do you follow me if there is any quantitative sort of number that you have around this daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company paul this is daniel excuse me this is daniel i would simply say that coming off of our 2018 request for proposals we were pleasantly surprised by the cost competitiveness of batteries in general obviously we have made some decisions then that as an alternative to gas as a peaking capacity for the late afternoon early evening ramp that we experience from a systems standpoint that battery storage charged by day time solar generation for three to four hour ramp windows in that late afternoon early evening timeframe is a viable solution for our customers and our system paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and by viable i mean without the environmental benefits and what have you would you say it s higher than what we d see if you had a gas plant sort of thing working with solar or i mean is there any do you follow what i m saying i m just trying to get sort of a picture as to how that what that kind of means if you follow me daniel t froetscher executive vice president of operations arizona public service company yes i would simply say we found it to be quite cost competitive paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay impressive and then just finally back on the question about customer sales which really seem to your forecast is really bumped out without customer growth really changing is that the size of the customer that you mentioned economic growth could you just elaborate just a little bit further on that in terms of what exactly how that actually is that just because they are larger customers that are coming on board or that the customers that you have are going to be using a lot more electricity just sort of how should we think about that donald e brandt chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think what you re seeing in the west valley is a lot of large commercial warehousing distribution data center so you

san diego so many farmers are dependent on off farm income in today s economy that lenders say the worst threat to farmers is a general economic recession the chief economist for the american farm bureau federation said here tuesday farm lenders say the reason why we can continue to do what we are doing is off farm income farm bureau chief economist john newton said during a panel discussion by agricultural economists at the crop insurance industry convention here it is off farm income that allows folks to continue to farm lenders are really concerned about a slowdown in the u s economy added newton as he presented statistics on the decline in farm income since 2013 the general u s economy is performing well newton said but he is worried because consumer confidence and the ceo confidence index have both fallen farm lenders say the reason why we can continue to do what we are doing is off farm income it is off farm income that allows folks to continue to farm lenders are really concerned about a slowdown in the u s economy john newton farm bureau chief economist newton said usda statistics show that in 2018 gross farm income was 435 billion and production expenses totaled 369 billion resulting in net farm income of 66 3 billion which was down 57 billion or 47 percent since 2013 the 2018 figures included 13 6 billion in government payments up 18 percent year to year that included traditional subsidies plus market facilitation payments to make up for trade losses and disaster payment net farm income in 2018 was the third lowest over the last 20 years in inflation adjusted terms with income down in all regions of the country he said without the government payments it would have been the lowest net farm income of all time he added president donald trump has tried to address the trade deficit that has grown since the approval of the north american free trade agreement and china joined the world trade organization but that has created headwinds for the farm economy and could hurt the overall economy newton said no commodity exemplifies what has happened more than soybeans newton said soybean exports are 40 percent below previous levels and the soybean stocks to use ratio of over 20 percent is unprecedented if we don t see a resolution to he said i don t see how soybeans can maintain the price they have today the soybean price he said may be 7 to 8 per bushel not the 9 50 price of today farm debt is at a record level of 410 billion newton said the debt to asset ratio is not as high as it was during the farm crisis of the 1980s he said but it is at 13 5 percent and has been rising for the last six years usda has projected net farm income slightly higher for 2019 at 77 6 billion but it has not provided details of how it came up with that estimate and it is hard to put projections on 2019 income because it s not known what farmers will plant or what the weather will be like he said it is a really really challenging time for u s agriculture newton said we are taking equity out of our operations harun balut of national crop insurance services and joe outlaw a professor at texas a m university said that crop insurance is vital to maintaining farm stability balut noted that crop insurance purchases vary from one part of the country to the other and said that both the public and private sectors should try to change policies that lead to lower levels of participation in some areas and with some crops outlaw said he believes the cost of crop insurance subsidies is small compared with their impact on the economy and that he is researching that subject as an adviser to congressional committees on agricultural policy outlaw noted that crop insurance used to be hard to sell to congress but now it is the premier product to protect farmers he warned however if anyone thnks that the fight is over with people who do not want to help farmers in this manner they are nuts the hagstrom report
washington afp advertising read more continued trade tensions and brexit are key risks facing the us economy and could undermine financial stability the federal reserve cautioned friday potential downside risks to international financial stability include a downturn in global growth political and policy uncertainty an intensification of trade tensions and broadening stress in emerging market economies the fed said in its semi annual report on monetary policy those concerns caused the fed to shift to wait and see mode after raising interest rates four times in 2018 after volatility in financial markets and increased concerns about global growth made the appropriate extent and timing of future rate increases more uncertain than earlier and the prospects that britain will leave the european union without an agreement could create a wide range of economic and financial activities could be disrupted despite preparations without such a withdrawal agreement there will be no transition period for important trade and financial interactions between uk and eu residents the report was prepared for congress to accompany the twice yearly testimony by fed chairman jerome powell who will appear tuesday and wednesday to answer questions about monetary policy powell and other central bankers late last year pivoted sharply away from expectations that more increases in the lynchpin for borrowing costs would be needed this year instead they clearly and repeatedly signaled they will pause for now the report cited tariffs as a key risk to rising inflation but falling oil prices and a strong dollar could dampen inflation in fact the trade tensions with china which are subject to high stakes negotiations this week are mentioned more than 20 times in the nearly 60 page report the report repeated that the fed continued to expect the us economy to put in a solid performance this year with inflation approaching the two percent target 2019 afp

over to julie robertson chairman president and chief executive of noble julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you jeff good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our review of fourth 2018 results i appreciate your participation in today s call and your continued interest in noble in addition to jeff i m joined today by adam peakes our senior vice president and chief financial officer and robert eifler our vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts adam will cover in detail the financial results for the fourth quarter and our thoughts regarding expectations for 2019 and robert will follow with a review of the noble fleet and an assessment of global offshore regions and opportunities this morning i want to begin with addressing our operational and fleet enhancement success from this past year which holds positive implications for 2019 these achievements were a result of the collective efforts involving focused team work execution from all organizational disciplines within the company in 2018 we achieved record safety performance as the company s total reportable incident rate or trir improved 11 from the prior record set in 2017 our 2018 safety mark remains superior when compared to the average trir results for the offshore drilling industry additionally from an operating perspective downtime across the noble fleet was only 2 7 in 2018 or stated inversely we registered 97 3 of operational uptime this achievement also represents a record result for the second consecutive year and it is most impressive that both the safety and fleet downtime results were achieved during a year in which we increased our active rig fleet by four rigs following the reactivation program and expanded our offshore headcount by 10 these results demonstrates noble s strong culture of excellence as we continued to emphasize strict adherence to best operational practices and maintain our focus on top quartile performance we are certain that these are the keys to delivering outstanding service across our global operations and the dedication of our worldwide offshore and shore based employees is what continues to deliver these results also in 2018 we moved decisively to improve the readiness and positioning of our floating and jack up fleets as improving market conditions became increasingly evident a total of four previously stacked units were reactivated over the year with a fifth reactivation project the noble sam croft expected to be completed next week in our floating rig fleet reactivations were finalized on the noble clyde boudreaux which also includes a significant upgrade to the rig s drilling capability and the drill ships noble tom madden and noble globetrotter ii in our jack up fleet the noble sam hartley completed its reactivation following the relocation of the rig to the north sea you will recall that throughout the industry downturn we elected to warm stack our premium fleet as per our company stacking protocol focusing on continuous maintenance and preservation as a result our rigs are returning to work at a lower overall reactivation cost and on a faster schedule than those rigs subjected to a less robust stacking methodology more importantly three of the five reactivated rigs are currently executing drilling programs in various regions around the world with the fourth and fifth units the globetrotter ii and the noble sam croft expected to commence operations in the black sea and the gulf of mexico respectively during march because of these efforts each has advantageously positioned to compete for follow on programs as operator needs materialize finally the acquisition of the noble johnny whitstine and the pending purchase of the noble joe knight improves the versatility of our jack up fleet adding two modern fit for purpose drilling solutions with an aggregate of six rig years of contract time in a region of the offshore industry that holds exceptional long term opportunity the johnny whitstine is currently mobilized into saudi arabia for an expected contract late march the noble joe knight is scheduled to arrive at the marine shipyard in singapore following the expected completion of the rig purchase at the end of this month rig will complete a similar commissioning program and client specific upgrades our expected contract commencement date also for saudi aramco in the kingdom is september 2019 with these two rig additions our jack up fleet remains at 13 units following the retirement of the standard duty jack up noble gene house in the fourth quarter of 2018 as it s completing 38 years of impeccable service approximately 85 of our jack up fleet is located in the middle east and north sea where we see exceptional contract opportunities in 2019 and beyond i will have more to say about the importance of our global fleet alignment as well as key areas of focus for 2019 in my closing comments for now i ll turn the call over to adam adam peakes senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you julie good morning and welcome to everyone noble finished 2018 on a strong note with fourth quarter results continuing the steady progress that began earlier in the year on a quarterly basis we set high marks for the year in fleet utilization contract drilling revenues and ebitda this is despite the persistent challenges our industry faces today on a reported basis the fourth quarter net loss attributable to noble totaled 33 million or 0 13 per diluted share on revenues of 310 million included in the reported results was a again from the retirement of debt and a discrete tax benefit which together totaled 66 million or 0 27 per diluted share net of tax with regard to the gain from debt retirement we spent approximately 20 million in cash to purchase 27 million of principal amount senior notes with maturities in 2040 2041 and 2042 this debt repurchase was done through a couple of small opportunistic open market repurchases during the fourth quarter these favorable items were partially offset by a 9 million or 0 04 per diluted share asset impairment charge relating to the standard duty jack ups noble joe beall and noble gene house following the close of the quarter the noble gene house was retired from service reducing the company s jack up fleet to 13 sorry to 12 units before the pending addition of the noble joe knight excluding the net favorable outcome of all of these items the net loss attributable to noble for the fourth quarter would have been 90 million or 0 36 per diluted share we have included a non gaap supporting schedule with our press release and the schedule can also be found on the noble website at noblecorp com that schedule provides a reconciliation of non gaap numbers to net loss attributable to noble corporation to income tax provision and to diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter 2018 fourth quarter 2017 and full years 2018 and 2017 contract drilling services revenues increased to 292 million in the fourth quarter up 9 when compared to the previous quarter in addition to a meaningful quarter over quarter reduction in fleet downtime the growth in revenues was driven by an 8 rise in operating days across the fleet with the floating rig side of our business experiencing a 23 improvement in activity we saw more operating days for the noble clyde and noble tom madden following the completion of reactivation projects in the third and fourth quarters respectively in addition to the contribution from these rigs revenues from the noble globetrotter ii and noble don taylor improved in the quarter with both rigs benefiting from the commencement of contract awards from third parties while continuing to collect special idle day rates associated with previously amended legacy contracts the special idle rate on the noble globetrotter ii concluded in early january 2019 and the day rate has transitioned to the previously defined four day rate of 275 000 a day however for the entire first quarter of 2019 the globetrotter ii will operate at an 80 of the four day rate or 220 000 per day while a managed pressure drilling system is installed ahead of commencement of its next drilling program in the black sea the noble don taylor continues to collect an idle day rate until february 25 2019 plus the day rate from a third party contract assigned contract drilling services cost in the fourth quarter totaled 179 million compared to 163 million in the preceding quarter the 10 increase which was within our guidance range was largely due to the additional operating days for the madden and for the jack up noble sam hartley which in mid october commenced a program in the north sea following relocation of the rig from southeast asia also rig reactivations and other steps to improve the overall readiness of our fleet contributed to the rise in costs of note the reactivation of the noble sam croft continued through the fourth quarter with the project responsible for approximately 3 million of incremental cost in the quarter when compared to the previous quarter this project will be completed later this month with the rig expected to commence a contract in the u s gulf of mexico in march earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda improved in to 102 million in the fourth quarter compared to 92 million in the preceding quarter in addition to the previously mentioned activity uptick seen predominantly in our floating fleet and the concurrent special idle and third party day rates for the noble don taylor and noble globetrotter ii we continued to collect revenues in excess of the stated floor rate on the noble globetrotter i while operating in the eastern mediterranean since other line items from the p l were largely in line with guidance offered in november i don t think there is a need for further comments here therefore i will move directly to our fourth quarter capital expenditures at 61 million capital expenditures in the fourth quarter compared to 76 million in the previous quarter of the year with capital exp for 2018 totalling 221 million including the following major components 83 million of sustaining capital 75 million related to major projects which included rig reactivations and the upgrade for the noble clyde boudreaux certain contract specific requests for various rigs and the installation of our mpv system 34 million for the upfront purchase price on the noble johnny whitstine and 29 million for subsea capital spares and other related projects for the year our net cash provided by operating activities totaled 172 million and we ended 2018 with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 375 million up from the 326 million at the conclusion of the third quarter our revolving credit facilities remained undrawn we do not have any debt maturities in 2019 and only 315 million of maturities between now and 2024 including the shipyard financing associated with the noble johnny whitstine and the pending financed portion of the noble joe knight purchase next i will offer some comments regarding financial guidance for the full year and first quarter of 2019 in addition to the usual line items from our p l my guidance comments will also include thoughts on contract drilling services revenues beginning with fleet performance we start the year with an assumed downtime factor of 4 up from the outstanding actual downtime performance in 2018 of 2 7 the higher estimate is driven largely by expected changes in our fleet mix given an expected increase in operating days from our floating fleet contract drilling services revenues in 2019 are expected to be essentially flat when compared to 2018 results or reaching just over an estimated 1 billion although fleet operating days in 2019 should increase by 10 to 15 from 2018 levels driven largely by contracts already in hand average daily revenues in 2019 are expected to trend lower as the noble don taylor reprices to market rates that continue to reflect a highly competitive industry dynamic revenues from client reimbursables should range from 25 million to 30 million in 2019 for the first quarter of 2019 revenues are expected to range from 255 million to 270 million compared to 292 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the decline is due primarily to lower average daily revenues in the floating fleet led by the conclusion of a legacy contract on the noble don taylor in late february revenues from client reimbursables should range from 5 million to 10 million in the first quarter moving now to contract drilling services cost we expect a range of 705 million to 725 million in 2019 compared to 200 2018 actual contract drilling services cost of 630 million the expected higher fleet activity is a primary driver of the increase rigs such as the noble tom madden noble sam croft and noble clyde boudreaux are expected to drive higher activity on the floating side of our business in our jack up fleet higher activity is expected to result from increased operating days on the noble johnny whitstine the noble joe knight the noble sam hartley noble mick o brien and noble hans deul client reimbursables for 2019 are expected to range from 15 million to 20 million for the first quarter of 2019 contract drilling services costs are expected to range between 168 million and 183 million compared to actual results of 179 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the expected flat outcome is due impart to a decline in rig reactivation cost and the retirement of the noble gene house cost associated with client reimbursables in the first quarter are expected to be in the range of 3 million to 5 million dd a expense for 2019 is expected to range from 445 million to 460 million compared to actual dd a for 2018 of 487 million the minor reduction from 2018 is due to the impact of rig impairments recognized in the previous year which were partially offset by the purchase of two jack ups one of which is pending and then expected to close in the next two weeks in the first quarter of 2019 we expect dd a to range from 110 million to 115 million compared to actual expense in the fourth quarter of 114 million sg a expense for 2019 is expected to fall into a range of 65 million to 75 million compared to actual expense in 2018 of 73 million our sg a expense for the first quarter is expected to total between 16 million and 20 million compared to actual expense of 15 million in the preceding quarter with higher professional fees the primary driver of the increase interest expense in 2019 is expected to range from 295 million to 300 million or basically flat with 2018 expense of 298 million although we will experience incremental interest expense in 2019 resulting from the third party financing from the noble johnny whitstine and the noble joe knight this expense will be largely offset by an estimated 5 million in capitalized interest associated with projects for the two rig additions interest expense for the first quarter is expected to total 72 million to 74 million net of an expected 2 million in capitalized interest non controlling interest on our p l represented the bully i and bully ii 50 50 joint ventures with shell are expected to total 5 million to 10 million of expense in 2019 compared to 5 million of expense in 2018 excluding the impairment charge for the noble bully i recognized in the third quarter of 2018 we expect 1 million of expense from non controlling interest for the first quarter capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to total 250 million and include the following major components 90 million for sustaining capital 97 million for major projects including reactivations 30 million relating to the purchase of the noble joe knight and 33 million related to subsea spares and other related projects almost 40 of our expected full year capital spend should occur in the first quarter when capital expenditures are planned to total 96 million including sustaining capital of 19 million 30 million for the noble joe knight rig purchase 47 million for major projects and reactivations including projects associated with the two rig purchases finally we expect the full year 2019 tax benefit to range from 10 to 15 cash taxes to be paid in 2019 are expected to total 20 million and relate entirely to our international operations in summary we entered 2019 in excellent position to extend fleet activity gains from the previous year although a decline in average daily revenues across the fleet is likely eight out of nine actively marketed floating rigs are currently under contract along with all twelve of our jack ups actually 13 jack ups in the contract if you include the pending purchase of the noble joe knight driving an expected 10 to 15 growth in fleet activity when compared to 2018 our recent reactivation of four rigs along with the subsequent contract awards for each supports our fleet activity projections and concludes for now all reactivation programs our premium floating and jack up fleets are at a higher state of readiness with excellent alignment in key geographic reason regions as a result we possess a strong competitive posture in what remains a challenging business environment finally steps taken in 2018 to address debt maturities and an extend liquidity have proven to be well timed and highly supportive as we direct our operating and growth strategies beyond 2019 i ll now turn the call over to robert for further perspective on the offshore market robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts thank you adam and good morning to everyone i ll open today with some observations on the current state of the offshore drilling industry provide an update on the status of the noble fleet which continues to show meaningful improvement in activity and finally close with an overview of regional developments and opportunities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 the effect of the drop in oil price has featured prominently in most discussions on the state of the offshore drilling industry following this short duration break down in price levels some operators primarily smaller ones indicated they would undertake reassessments of their 2019 upstream spending assumptions during the first quarter as a result we have seen some cancellations and delays in 2019 well programs primarily in the floating sector however it s our belief that while these changes will have some negative effects they won t be significant especially in relation to our own fleet marketing efforts in fact jack up contracting activity is continuing at a very strong pace and floater activity remains active as evidenced by the numerous tenders outstanding to fill floating rig needs across the globe noble s experience has also been encouraging with contract days added in january for our floating rig fleet and important opportunities emerging for our jack ups i ll have more to say on our fleet in a moment we believe our industry remains in early stages of recovery and any adverse impact stemming from the late 2018 crude oil price volatility should prove to be short term in nature we have already witnessed a swift recovery in the price of brent december 2018 low of 51 per barrel the international benchmark rose to an average price of 60 per barrel in january 2019 and has remained above this average through february the return to a sustained trading range that is above the breakeven prices associated with many of our customers offshore projects is likely to support greater activity over the near to intermediate term we also view the actions taken by global exploration and production companies as excellent indicators of future offshore activity for example customer interest in emerging basins with low risk and high resource potential is rapidly building due in part to improving offshore access and successful exploration results basins such as guyana brazil and mexico are good examples of regions where drilling activity in 2019 is expected to be higher when compared to the previous year also activity in mature offshore basins such as the north sea is expected to expand due to a combination of changes in the ownership of producing an undeveloped acreage exploration success in the presence of established offshore infrastructure to provide the quicker path to commercialization finally customers are using technological advances that drive the cost of doing business offshore lower through improved exploration results and superior field recovery enhanced seismic acquisition and expedited image technologies are creating value for our customers and seismic activity which is forward indicator is showing positive signs we believe a prolonged period of underinvestment in offshore basins has contributed to operators poor production and reserve replacement results in recent years but that this trend has bottomed and offshore investments will continue to improve going forward evidence of an increased offshore focus by operators is encouraging the jack up market has been steadily improving for over a year and we see this trend continuing especially for the higher end segment the fourth quarter brought an impressive 76 fixtures in the jack up space which was an 81 improvement over the first quarter of last year in the floating sector we expect to see modest improvement in utilization this year but believe pricing will remain challenged for any work that begins in 2019 fleet positioning and contractual cover continued to be of paramount importance and i believe noble is well placed in both areas i now want to update you on the status of the noble fleet beginning with our floating rigs among our eight drill ships we entered 2019 with a markedly improved competitive position relative to one year ago the utilization in the fourth quarter improved to 72 compared to 60 in the same quarter of 2017 following the completion of reactivation programs on the noble tom madden and noble san croft we are able to meaningfully expand our contract days in 2019 five of our eight drill ships are committed through 2019 following the recent one year contract award for the noble tom madden that places the rig on the assignment offshore guyana into the first quarter of 2020 with the noble bully i likely to remain cold stacked the noble don taylor and noble san croft are the only units with 2019 availability both rigs are currently under contract into april and the second half of 2019 respectively and we are encouraged by an expanding number of follow on opportunities for each rig in our semi submersible fleet the noble clyde boudreaux has performed well for our client and opportunities for follow on work in the region remains strong including option wells available to our clients also the noble paul romano remains warm stacked in the u s gulf of mexico while we evaluate several opportunities for the rig both in and outside of the region all of the programs under evaluation would have a commencement date in 2019 finally our two remaining semi submersibles the noble jim day and noble danny adkins remain idle as we continue to evaluate suitable contract opportunities in our jack up fleet we entered 2019 in the enviable position of having all of our units under contract with only an estimated 25 of days available for the year fleet utilization ended 2018 at 94 compared to 75 at the end of 2017 we continue to benefit from growing customer demand in the north sea the middle east and offshore australia where the noble tom prosser recently secured a series of contracts that will employ the rig into the first half of 2020 these three regions are currently or will soon be home to 12 of our 13 units including our recent impending fleet additions the noble johnny whitstine and the noble joe knight both rigs are expected to commence operations offshore saudi arabia in the first and third quarters of 2019 respectively the noble mick o brien is the only jack up with clear availability in 2019 beginning in august while the noble hans deul and noble sam hartley each have options available to their current clients for the uncontracted remainder of 2019 we believe all three rigs are well placed to capture additional days under contract in their respective regions i now want to provide a review of regional market developments and opportunities beginning in the western hemisphere in the u s gulf of mexico the marketed supply of floating rigs was down 21 over the last year from 33 rigs in january 2018 to 26 at present the number of contracted floaters has remained stable especially over the past eight months at approximately 20 rigs resulting in a current marketed utilization of 77 higher exploration activity could be seen in 2019 leading to tighter utilization the expected increase in exploration activity is driven in part by drilling success over the past three years announced deepwater discoveries in the u s gulf totaled 17 including three discoveries in 2018 also the customer base has become more diversified in recent years with representation from majors and large and small independents in mexico the pmx 2019 capital budget was recently increased 23 with an estimated 45 of the 23 billion total budget earmarked for exploration and production initiatives the majority of the offshore activity is expected to address shallow and mid water projects as evidenced by a recent award for up to 16 wells in shallow water depths a new administration began in december 2018 and has thus far announced no further licensing rounds until 2021 although all offshore licenses and contracts already awarded will be honored allowing operators to proceed with their planned programs operator interest in south america continues to build in response to the continent s exceptional resource potential in brazil petrobras has tenders outstanding for six rigs covering one to two years each once awarded these contracts are expected to commence in 2019 the rigs are expected to be allocated to new programs and for the replacement of incumbent capacity looking out to 2020 and beyond an additional source of rig demand is likely come from a growing list of international oil companies that are poised to commence offshore programs in brazilian waters following the signing of production sharing agreements guyana continues to establish its reputation as the western hemisphere s most prolific exploration play with mounting exploration successes driving higher recoverable resource estimates the exceptional geologic achievement in offshore guyana continues to drive more interest in the region with several operators planning new exploration campaigns offshore guyana and french guyana during 2019 noble has emerged as a leading service provider in the region with the drill ships noble bob douglas and noble tom madden providing development and exploration drilling services offshore guyana while the noble sam croft is due to arrive in mid 2019 to commence an exploration campaign in the region turning to the eastern hemisphere premium jack up capacity in the u k north sea is expected to experience further tightening in 2019 following some seasonal weakness during the fourth quarter of 2018 day rates experienced meaningful appreciation in 2018 and are expected to move higher in 2019 utilization of the region s premium jack up fleet is approaching 100 also asset transactions among operators continue at a healthy pace as existing larger iocs exit the region and smaller and more nimble operators enter creating a more diversified ownership base the middle east remains a significant source of incremental demand for both standard and high specification jack ups more than 50 rig years of work have been awarded since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2018 with noble securing over six years in 2019 an additional 50 plus rig years remain under evaluation including jack up needs in saudi arabia kuwait and qatar and more will emerge as the year progresses in west africa we expect a modestly better environment in 2019 the marketed jack ups plan in the region currently stands at just under 80 while floating rigs remain oversupplied with marketed utilization currently at 41 the majority of visible programs are short term in nature although a few notable longer term opportunities have emerged along with some welcome exploration success the mediterranean region could address a portion of the idle floating capacity in the africa region several tenders are outstanding for multiple operators for programs primarily offshore egypt and in the black sea finally floating and jack up opportunities in the far east and oceana are on the rise with regard to floating rigs the supply of available semi submersibles is declining following the award of several mid water programs for work offshore myanmar indonesia vietnam and australia in addition to incremental customer needs program extensions are increasingly likely and we could see an improving day rate environment as the year progresses in the jack up segment customer enquiries are healthy and tenders are numerous across southeast asia and we expect the contracted jack up count to show improvement throughout 2019 in summary despite the negative effects of short term uncertainty regarding the price of crude actions by our customers suggest a focus on offshore programs is intensifying jack up activity and pricing has steadily improved and floater utilization is improving as well importantly noble s fleet has excellent contract coverage in 2019 and strategically positioned in the right markets i believe our premium and versatile fleet strong operational execution and excellent geographic presence position noble for success as offshore activity expands i ll now turn the call back over to julie julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you robert and adam for your insights as we work through the early days of 2019 i am encouraged by what noble can accomplish in this new year i agree with robert s conclusion that in 19 we will continue to see a competitive environment but as i noted earlier i believe actions taken by noble in 2018 place us in a truly favorable position to compete in 2019 and beyond our rig reactivation projects have gone well with each of the five reactivated units currently contracted even better new contract opportunities are becoming increasingly visible keeping a number of these rigs contractually engaged well into or beyond 2019 as evidenced by the recent contract award to the noble tom madden in guyana and expected contract extension for the noble clyde offshore myanmar i also believe our global rig fleet distribution advantageously positions us for a growing number of contract opportunities in key regional pockets of strength as we noted earlier our jack up fleet is highly consolidated into the north sea and middle east regions for 11 to 12 units will operate following the deployment of the noble johnny whitstine and the noble joe knight both regions have numerous customer needs outstanding that define the prospects for visible work into 2019 and beyond availability and our marketed premium floating fleet is concentrated in the western hemisphere where enormous resource potential is driving heightened exploration interest and multi year development opportunities we have already established a leading presence in some regions such as guyana with to other attractive locations including mexico brazil and we began this year with a higher percentage of operating days into contract on january 1 of this year 75 of our jack up days and 49 of our floating rig days were under contract as compared to 53 for jack ups and 36 for floaters at the same time in 2018 more importantly for all the reasons noted previously we are increasingly confident of improving these figures as we progress throughout the year finally success in 2019 will be driven in part by our ability to improve total fleet utilization and we are focused on identifying securing the best contracting opportunities and matching our rigs technical capabilities with our customers needs this focus pertains especially to our recently reactivated rigs where we look to assemble a continuum of visible work also we will continue to position an appropriate number of our premium rigs in regions that present attractive long term opportunities allowing us to maximize value creation another way to create value is by growing our fleet as we have recently demonstrated we believe attractive premium rig acquisition candidates remain available and we are committed to a thorough evaluation process as we look to opportunistically grow as always i would like to recognize and thank the entire noble team for your dedication and service to our company the strong culture that sets noble apart from others is based upon the commitment of all team members to delivering superior performance for our shareholders and our customers each and every day with our continued focus on safety the environment operational excellence and steadfast customer service we are well positioned as we enter into our 99th year of business thank you again for your interest in noble i ll turn the call back over to jeff jeff chastain vice president of investor relations and corporate communications ok thank you julie krista we re ready to go ahead and begin the q a session of the call so if you would assemble the queue and identify the first caller please questions and answers operator certainly your first question comes from the line of kurt hallead from rbc please go ahead kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning kurt kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst ok thanks for all that detail and color so i m going to my question kind of focus on the floater market here so when you look out into 19 and even beyond 2019 and you assess the new demand that s out there in terms of contracts can you give us some general sense on what the mix is between exploration and development robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts yes sure kurt this is robert so we are seeing most of the longer term demand that s out there which people are pretty focused on is development work there have been a few fairly notable exploration successes here last year especially in the last part of last year so have a percentage break down in front of me i think that the important trend is that exploration focus has steadily improved over the last year and a half or so on the floating side kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst ok i appreciate that color now second the follow up question i had then for you was given the backdrop with respect to improving demand can you give us some general sense on how you re thinking about the rigs that you have that are idle in terms of do you think how many of those rigs do you think that could be activated in 2019 and what the potential costs are to activate those rigs julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer well kurt we ll start with the floaters just we ll pick those first we would love to reactivate obviously the are very capable units lot of foot load capacity lot of deck space those are unique drilling assets which customers are willing to work reactivation cost for those would be somewhere between 50 million and 100 million we could easily add more as you know those are bp3 units but we could easily add more into those units to make them attractive in certain regions but we think that those have a great potential to get back to work in the right markets the paul romano is currently warm stacked it came on contract not long and w we think that rig has a lot of potential of going back to work soon we re bidding that on lot of opportunities also the robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts just add the bully i julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer the bully i robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts we re in probably well certainly not a 2019 event for that rig but we are focused with shell on discussing what sort of long term opportunities may exist putting that rig into either a different region or into a slightly different usage and so we re in lot of communication with them adam peakes senior vice president and chief financial officer yes kurt this is adam in addition to julie and robert s comments i think it s important to point out that the guidance that we provided for 2019 does not contemplate any reactivation around the day or the bully as julie said we continue to think those are strategic assets that are going to have a nice future but we re going to be really disciplined in how we think about bringing those out of stack and i think as we julie outlined the cost profile to bring those back as we sit here today that s not contemplated for 2019 i think we continued it to need to see an improving market to feel compelled to do that and specifically anticipating a follow on question i think to make that decision to reactivate any of those rigs we would need to have a contract with a substantial payback on that reactivation capital and so we re aways away from doing that it will be a high class problem when we get there but that s not contemplated for 2019 kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst all right that s awesome thanks appreciate it julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you kurt operator your next question comes from the line of ian macpherson from simmons please go ahead ian your line is open ian macpherson simmons and company international analyst hello can you hear me adam peakes senior vice president and chief financial officer yes ian julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer yes ian good morning ian macpherson simmons and company international analyst you called my name and i apologize my attention has been divided during your call so i apologize if any of this but i wanted to ask you robert if you addressed the outlook for the s rollover and what the prospects are there for next work and how we should think about any gaps that may ensue after next month and then i separately wanted to ask as the joe knight contract broadly resembles what you got for the whitstine i assume that it does i just wanted to confirm that or maybe comment if there is anything materially different about the economics on that deal and then just if there is any scalability or keepability of those two jack up bolt ons that you re looking at that we should think about that s it for me thank you julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer sure robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts sure thanks ian on the first we the customer does have options on that rig and it s little too early to talk about the outcome there but we do anticipate that that rig stays active throughout 2019 and without any gaps in the region on the joe knight the contract construct and the economics are very similar as they were with johnny whitstine and in terms of scalability i would say we re we think about market share in the kingdom and we made those purchases to maintain scale and market share in the kingdom i would not say that we re interested in expanding through similar purchases at this time but we re very happy with the two we ve made and that we re able to put those into long term contracts with an extremely important customer of ours ian macpherson simmons and company international analyst thanks and yes i would say well done on both of those as well thank you robert julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks ian operator your next question comes from the line of scott gruber from citigroup please go ahead scott gruber citi analyst yes good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning scott scott gruber citi analyst adam you quoted about a 100 million of spend for projects this year about 30 million for subsea spares no reactivation capex how should we generally think about spending on projects and spares beyond 2019 i realize the project spend can be lumpy and there s a good portion that hits reimbursables but just assuming the current fleet composition assuming no reactivations kind of what s a reasonable figure to these buckets beyond 2019 adam peakes senior vice president and chief financial officer yes scott thanks for the question i think it s important to frame that as we think about our needs and what that means from a capex budget standpoint for a fleet our size regular sustaining capital plus the inevitable projects you have year in year out would be about 150 million for us annually so i would think about that as a starting point for capital budget so absent doing anything reactivations or spend around repurchase or purchases of rigs etc we d be kind of right at 150 and so the increase you see this year is driven of course by the rig purchases and the ready to drill spend associated with that as well as reactivations so i would think about as going forward in a regular year by 150 scott gruber citi analyst got it appreciate it and then the north sea market has been tightening for a bit of time now are you starting to see any inflation on your north sea cost and is there inflation protection in the contracts robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts we do not have inflation protection in any of our current contracts but we have also not seen any meaningful inflation in the region on the labor side or on the equipment side scott gruber citi analyst is that a risk you see going forward are you starting to push for cost inflation protection in places like the north sea robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts so i would say when we re thinking about longer term contracts yes that s on our list in the north sea i think we re less concerned about inflation there right now we really haven t seen it in fact i think prices there have surprised excuse me cost there have surprised on the low side and i d just point out of course we re operating in essentially the non norway sectors there so i m not at all speaking to the norwegian sector but in that sector denmark and the u k we re pretty comfortable with our cost structure there scott gruber citi analyst got it that s it for me thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sasha sanwal from ubs securities please go ahead sasha sanwal ubs securities analyst thank you and good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer morning sasha sasha sanwal ubs securities analyst yes maybe for the first one you kind of touched on this in the commentary but just wanted to see if you could get some of your thoughts on leading edge pricing for floaters for programs starting in 2020 and then adam just with the day you kind of pre empted this question but would it kind of be fair to say that be really need a day rate north of kind of 250 000 would you guys really seriously think about bringing those rigs back robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts sure so on the first piece of that there isn t a clean fixture for anything that starts in 2020 just doesn t exists right now so we are watching that closely as everyone that follows the industry certainly in our bidding strategy we are looking for higher prices for anything that starts out in that time period and at the same time we are analyzing potential for some sort of indexing type mechanism that would help bridge a gap to get us there because there exists a wide range of opinions on where rates might be a year or more out right now so the market doesn t exist today on just a clean top tier drillship fixture in my opinion and so i think everyone will still wait and see adam peakes senior vice president and chief financial officer yes with regard to the day and what kind of environment we need to reactivate those i wouldn t want to peg it to a specific day rate other than to say it needs to be substantially above where rates are today i wouldn t have an issue with the 250 000 that you threw out as a good number as any i think more than anything else we are just trying to make clear that our appetite to take risk there is not there today and we would whether it s been rate on a shorter term or a longer term contract we would need substantial payback and visibility to recovering all of that ultimately in a fairly short period of time before we d undertake that kind of spend sasha sanwal ubs securities analyst great thank you that s helpful and just as a follow up i guess kind of following the purchase of the joe knight just wanted to get your thoughts on just what on what further optionality might be out there for similar acquisitions and just how that might fit into the capital allocation priorities for 2019 julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer sasha as we said earlier we will continue to look at every opportunity that s out there as robert noted in his comments or in his response to a question earlier we re probably not going to look to duplicate exactly what we have done at least s certainly not in this budget for this year but we re continuing to look at every opportunity out there and if there is something that fits an opportunity that a customer is bringing up so an opportunity that s out there that we can match up to contracts we will certainly look earnestly at it and find the way to get it done sasha sanwal ubs securities analyst great thank you i ll turn it over julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sean meakim from jp morgan please go ahead sean meakim j p morgan analyst thank you good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning sean sean meakim j p morgan analyst so maybe we could just talk about on the drill ships have you been engaging more in direct negotiations versus open tendering just curious kind of how that mix is looking in terms of your discussions with your customers and are you getting any more progress in terms of customer willingness to reimburse for i m just curious if kind of at the margin kind of those conversations are evolving in the last few months julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer sean we ve been lucky to be able to deal with sometime some operators obviously directly on direct negotiations obviously that stems from the performance that we re giving for them but certainly there are other tender opportunities on what robert add color to that robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts sure i think the mix of tendering versus direct negotiations is definitely increased especially if you look back over the past call it 18 months and that s encouraging on the mode side a number of our recent discussions have included some sort of and as an indicator i think that s probably today something closer to cost reimbursement than it is to some sort of recognition of loss revenue like it had been at the market high but certainly it s encouraging to see that operators are now willing to contribute to get the right rigs into the regions where they want them so sean meakim j p morgan analyst yes thank you i appreciate that and then just the follow on then would be thinking about rigs like the romano as that as the market evolves and those opportunities shift a bit does that begin to change your thinking or do you cast a wider net in terms of where you re willing to potentially send that rig or bid it out for projects or gulf of mexico is sufficient in terms of opportunities it seems unlikely you d be willing to take those types of you d be searching for those types of opportunities further away robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts sure so i mentioned in the comments the romano is bid outside of the region but not i would say not far outside the region that rig has had an incredible history one downside on the designs is that they don t tow very quickly and there are not a lot of heavy lifts to move them on so it s a long way of saying that we think certainly that the most likely future for that rig is in the u s or in the caribbean i d note there are not very many more rigs in the region right now and in fact more only rigs i believe were the only available unit in the region right now and so in that mid water sector there is some demand and we are watching it closely and hopeful that something could produce itself here during the year sean meakim j p morgan analyst fair enough thanks for that feedback julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you sean operator your next question comes from the line of taylor zurcher from tudor pickering and holt please go ahead taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst hey good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer morning taylor taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst on the jack up side most of your jack ups are positioned in the middle east in the north sea which coincidentally are two of the healthiest markets in the world and so the question is can you compare and contrast for us the different pricing dynamics you re seeing in both of those markets at least as it pertains to 2020 type start dates robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts yes sure taylor so the north sea has been ahead of the middle east on pricing in our opinion and we saw and we are able to start moving prices there earlier the middle east is a more diverse environment for rigs because you have a lot more demand for standard spec units in the region than you do in the north sea right now and so pricing i think is wider in the middle east i will say that for a number of reasons there have been a bunch of high specification jobs that have come up during the past year and specifically now as we re looking at it there are number of options for some hp ht work in a lot of the gas drilling in several different countries there so we have tried really hard to position especially our ju 3000 class rig into work that requires a higher level rig and we re extremely pleased that in the middle east those opportunities seem to be coming forward in great numbers so in those instances there is a pricing disparity and we are getting some and hopeful to get some higher pricing on some of those more difficult jobs it remains though especially with the tightening we are expecting in the north sea in the 2019 that pricing is a little bit ahead in that region still today taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst ok that s helpful on the floater side i would assume that the full year 2019 revenue and cost guidance would bake in some healthy utilization for the don taylor which rolls off its existing contract i think in a couple months here so curious if you could just frame for us how you re thinking about following work prospects for that rig and how we should think about potential gaps beyond april for that rig robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts and so we re chasing a number of different opportunities in the region if you look at when that rig rolls there really aren t i m not sure that there are any comparable rigs in the region available at that time and so we re pretty bullish about the prospects for the rig throughout the rest of this year now there could be certain revenue gaps if we need to change customers but those we re hopeful would be just transition gaps and that we will be successful in securing some good utilization through the remainder of the year same taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst guys thank you robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts taylor but i d just add that rig has some options available to the client afterwards and we are hopeful that we re successful that the operator is successful in extending that contract so but that s yet to be seen taylor zurcher tudor pickering holt and company analyst thank you that s it for me julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thanks taylor operator your next question comes from the line of greg lewis from btig please go ahead your line is open greg lewis btig analyst yes hi thank you and good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning greg greg lewis btig analyst i guess and this question is for robert and robert i apologize if you have already elaborated on this earlier in the call but i believe you mentioned that clearly some of the volatility in oil prices has kind of shifted around some potential opportunities that you re seeing but so i guess my question is as you look at the landscape of opportunities out there today could you sort of segment them out between like what how much of that work do you think is that you re seeing is out there for 2019 versus how much of the work that is out there you are seeing for like 2020 and beyond robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts sure the majority of what we part of this is driven by our test in our fleet but the majority of what of the discussions we re having right now are 2019 starts there are a number of 2020 start opportunities out there some of them have existed for a bit of time right now i m not aware of really conclusion to a lot of that but certainly what we re chasing right now due to our availability is primarily 2019 greg lewis btig analyst and that s equal for both jack ups and floaters robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts well so jack ups that s a little bit different and again this includes our contracting dynamics but we do have a number of 2020 opportunities on the jack up side right now which i find pretty bullish considering the lead time for a jack up contract is normally significantly stronger than on the floater side but we don t have a whole lot of availability excuse me during 2019 so we re passing up a number of jobs that we ve seen or tenders i should say that we ve seen i d note that kind of through the fourth quarter and 2019 so far on the jack up side there does there seems to be a great deal of tendering activity and unfortunately we re having to pass on a number of those just due to availability greg lewis btig analyst ok great and then just one more on potential opportunities that are out there at this point i mean clearly you guys are very successful in buying those two jack ups from the shipyard it looks like there were a couple other jack ups that were sold this week from shipyards as you look at the potential opportunities out there at this point are they primarily only coming from shipyards and i guess what i would ask on follow up to that is as you think about potentially doing some of these acquisitions would noble be willing to use its stock as currency in potentially acquiring some rigs julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer we re willing greg to look at all options and yes certainly if it makes sense for shareholders we would certainly look at using stock for the right opportunities to your first question it most of the opportunities are coming from shipyards right now but so but we re open to look at everything and we re looking we re willing to look at things that match up with contracts and looking at various options to be able to pay for those greg lewis btig analyst ok guys thank you great perfect great answer julie thank you julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you greg operator your next question comes from the line of eduardo royes from jefferies please go ahead eduardo royes jefferies analyst hey guys good morning julie robertson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning eduardo eduardo royes jefferies analyst just a quick question as we see more and more of these kind of very short term deepwater contracts maybe it s one well multiple wells on the back of that i m just curious versus 10 12 a year or 18 months ago if you re able to start negotiating firmer pricing increases at least on those option bids i know it s not a whole lot i m not talking about rates doubling or anything but some more willingness from the customers to say yes ok if we do that next well we have no problem paying x percent more or if that hasn t really changed versus the trough robert eifler vice president and general manager of marketing and contracts sure so it s been i ll say at least one of our current contracts includes pricing increases in the option structure and that was quite some time ago now i think the markets improved since then and our willingness today to consider price options has diminished significantly and generally speaking i think it s we re less willing to give any sort of options on the floating space that would take us out into the kind of 2020 especially mid 2020 time frame right now as we see and are hopeful that this market firms up eduardo royes jefferies analyst great thank you and just one quick follow up for me i know we re at the hour does the opex guidance for this year adam include any sort of is this an above average year i guess from an sps perspective or any small scale stuff that maybe elevates that a lot obviously there is a lot of rigs coming up on five years old i know those aren t huge buckets but you ve seen some of your peers have slightly higher guidance and i think a lot of it is you add up a bunch of small things whether it s small projects or just sps things that aren t necessarily capitalized just wondering if that s at all the case for you guys adam peakes senior vice president and chief financial officer no it s really eduardo in this case nothing significant to callout there it s not driven by that it s frankly driven by we ve got a whole lot more assets working so we re going to be up in terms of rig operating days about 800 days year over year so it s really that not some sps or other funky stuff that might enter into the equation eduardo royes jefferies analyst great got it thank you i ll turn it back jeff chastain vice president of investor relations and corporate communications krista with that we re going to go ahead and close today s call we appreciate everyone s participation today and your continued interest in noble krista thank you again for coordinating the call good day everyone operator duration 63 minutes call participants jeff chastain vice president of investor relations and corporate communications julie

the major currencies against the us dollar have been without trend for nearly six months trading ranges have been shrinking and volatility falling last year s dollar ascendancy in the first three quarters was based on three pillars the federal reserve s tightening policy a strong american economy and an intermittent safety hedge it is obsolescent the fed has paused its rate hikes the us economy is showing signs of fatigue and the fears of a trans pacific trade war and a no deal brexit have subsided though they are not gone since early october the euro has moved in a three figure range between 1 1600 and 1 1300 for most of that period the range was narrower 1 1300 to 1 1500 with short lived excursions outside the 407 point absolute range point is about 3 5 of the mid rate at 1 1450 the yen has had a greater overall range 114 00 to 108 00 but the range is split neatly in half from october to late december the distance was 114 00 to 112 00 and in the new year 111 00 to 108 00 even so the absolute range is about 6 4 of the 111 00 midpoint sterling traded between 1 3200 and 1 2600 for the bulk of the period with the rise and fall largely determined by the vagaries of the brexit negotiations the australian dollar and the new zealand dollar have been even more restricted the aussie shifting between 0 7300 and 0 7050 and the kiwi between 0 6900 and 0 6700 the apparent weakening of the dollar s supports has not produced a reversal for the us currency but only a pause the evolution of fed policy the us china dispute brexit and the expansion of the american economy may again provide solid reasons for buying the dollar it depends on how these issues play out to quote the federal reserve in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate patience is not a change in policy as the fed noted its rate policy will be determined by the state of the us and the global economies it is not inconceivable that a resurgent us expansion backed by a healthy world environment will elicit two rate increases in the second half of the year such is not the current market assumption it should be remembered that the fed s policy over the last three years was not based on forestalling inflation or economic excesses but on returning rates to a more historic level the stated goal was normalization to provide a cushion for reduction when the next recession arrives the governors have retreated from hikes whenever they might have threatened economic growth they have also resumed increases when the economy has been judged strong enough to support them there is no reason to assume that the governors will not want to augment their recession armory with higher rates if they can be safely obtained the comparison with the ecb s rate policy which just ended its bond program and liquidity support of the euro zone economy is instructive mario draghi and company know that when the next recession occurs their only option will be another bond program that will drive european rates even further into the negative with unknown long term effects on economic growth and prosperity they did not withdraw support because the economic and political situation did not permit them to do so not because the current rate structure is ideal european rates are not at the neutral bound negative rates are not normal the key factor for all parties is the us china trade dispute the potential for a trade pact to drive expansion in both countries is great together the world s two largest economies can promote sufficient global growth to make brexit s economic dislocations if they occur superfluous if a substantial agreement is signed between the two nations the resulting surge in growth in the us and china and the accompanying rise in business and consumer sentiment could bring the fed back to its original intentions even without active acknowledgement from the governors a strengthening us economy will move market speculation to dollar promotion like fed policy the six month outcome for the dollar is reality based
the pivotal point in trade talks drove markets higher the hopes are that china and us will be able to forge a deal stocks the s p 500 index jumped by 0 29 percent as of 15 39 london time there were 188 stocks up and 316 stocks trading lower the total volume was 396 million shares the nasdaq 100 recovered some its losses from yesterday and jumped 0 35 percent and the dow jones industrial average also popped by 0 36 percent the stoxx europe 600 index ignored weak german ifo business data and jumped higher by 0 16 percent germany s dax index had decent gains today it gained 0 41 percent the msci emerging market index gained 0 73 on a volume of 3m shares currencies the dollar spot index finally dropped today by 0 14 the us trade war negotiations remain the main focal point the euro reclaimed its level of 1 13 against the dollar thanks to the improving inflation numbers the british pound moved above the 1 30 mark against the dollar however the currency is still down today by 0 13 the low of the day was 1 2968 and high of the day was 1 3051 the japanese yen moved lower today and dropped by 0 11 percent bonds the yield on 10 year treasuries sank by three basis points to 2 65 percent germany s 10 year dropped two basis point to 0 103 percent britain s 10 year yield also fell by five basis point to 1 151 commodities west texas intermediate crude gained 0 84 percent to 57 46 gold maintained its momentum and moved higher by 0 13 the support of 1 300 is under focus the pivotal point in trade talks drove markets higher the hopes are that china and us will be able to forge a deal

that could cause actual results to differ after our remarks on the quarter we will be happy to take your questions with that i ll turn the call over to mike mike hilton president and chief executive officer good morning everyone thank you for joining nordson s 2019 fiscal first quarter conference call we entered this year knowing we were facing a challenging comparison against 2018 s outstanding first quarter performance where we achieved organic sales growth of 19 2019 s first quarter performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter and consistent with the typical seasonal pattern of sequential quarterly sales growth spending to support our business selling and administrative expenses did not vary significantly from quarter to quarter therefore segment operating margins in the first quarter were impacted as expected by the lower sales volume we expect sales each quarter to improve in line with our historic seasonality allowing us to achieve our previously announced fiscal 2019 sales growth and margin guidance during the quarter we delivered on various continuous improvement initiatives including further integration of operations into our north american shared service center and our adhesive facility consolidation within europe and the u s in addition during the quarter we continued to execute our capital allocation strategy by investing 102 million for the repurchase of approximately 856 000 shares and we distributed 20 million in dividends i ll speak more about our fiscal 19 annual guidance in a few moments but first i ll turn the call over to greg to provide more detailed perspective on the quarter greg thaxton executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you mike and good morning to everyone first quarter sales decreased 10 compared to the prior year s first quarter this change in sales included a decrease of 9 organic volume growth related to the first year effect of acquisitions of 1 and a decrease of 2 related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year s first quarter first quarter s acquisitive growth includes the fiscal 2018 acquisition of clada medical devices and two months of the fiscal 2018 acquisition of sonoscan as mike noted our first quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations as we were up against an exceptional prior year first quarter within the adhesive dispensing systems segment sales decreased approximately 4 compared to the prior year s first quarter inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of approximately 2 and a decrease of approximately 3 related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year we did deliver organic growth in most product lines however this segment s performance was offset by non woven product line sales where system sales tend to be larger dollar and order patterns can be sporadic depending upon new oem lines or customer line upgrades as noted we were up against very challenging comparisons within the advanced technology systems segment where prior year first quarter organic sales volume increased 50 in the current year first quarter sales decreased approximately 14 compared to the prior year s first quarter inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of approximately 15 an increase of approximately 2 related to the first year effect of acquisitions and a decrease of approximately 1 related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year double digit growth within the fluid management product lines and solid growth within test and inspection product lines was offset largely by the difficult comparison for the dispensing product lines associated with electronic end markets industrial coating systems segment sales decreased approximately 10 compared to the prior year s first quarter inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of approximately 9 and a decrease of approximately 2 related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year softer demand for cold material product lines associated with automotive end markets had the largest impact as compared to the prior year and like other larger dollar system sales demand can be lumpy for product lines within this segment moving down the income statement gross margin for the total company was 54 in the quarter operating profit was 84 million with reported operating margin of 17 regarding the adhesive facility consolidation initiative that we have talked about in previous quarters we incurred approximately 1 million of duplicate costs during the quarter we do not expect duplicate costs to be material for the remainder of the fiscal year in addition we incurred restructuring charges of approximately 1 5 million during the quarter with most of this cost related to the adhesive facility consolidation initiative as mike noted earlier operating margin for each of the segments was negatively impacted by lower sales volume in the quarter we expect this year s performance to play out in line with historical seasonal patterns where incremental sales generate significant margin leverage on a total company basis net income for the quarter was 49 million and gaap diluted earnings per share were 0 83 inclusive of approximately 0 09 per share of charges related to onetime items these onetime items include non recurring restructuring charges of 0 02 per share additionally a net discrete tax charge of approximately 4 million or 0 07 per diluted share was recognized in the quarter primarily related to the u s federal income tax reform legislation we delivered first quarter ebitda of 108 million or 22 of sales inclusive of the 1 5 million of restructuring charges and approximately 1 million of duplicate costs associated with the adhesive facility consolidation free cash flow before dividends during the quarter was 43 million or 89 of net income this cash conversion ratio is typical for our first quarter our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as ebitda and adjusted ebitda from a balance sheet perspective net debt to ebitda was approximately 2 3 times trailing 12 months ebitda at the end of the first quarter where we maintained adequate capacity for strategic priorities i ll now turn the call back over to mike for a few closing comments mike hilton president and chief executive officer thank you greg as i mentioned earlier our first quarter was in line with our expectations where sales are typically the softest our spending is generally consistent from quarter to quarter but we typically see an increase in the first quarter due to compensation increases we expect to increase sales volumes sequentially as the year progresses and we remain committed to our annual organic sales guidance growth guidance of 3 to 5 for fiscal 19 we ve forecasted unfavorable currency effects of 2 while we continue to monitor macroeconomic challenges and the ongoing trade discussions our customer conversations are encouraging the strength of our diverse end markets and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives across emerging markets product innovation new applications and tiering give us confidence in our target the team also remains committed to achieving the operational improvements that support our previously announced operating and ebitda margin enhancement target of 100 to 150 basis points over the fiscal 2018 performance as always thank you to our customers employees and shareholders for your continued support with that we pause and take your questions questions and answers operator and our first question comes from allison poliniak with wells fargo your line is now open allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst good morning guys mike hilton president and chief executive officer good morning allison allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst i just want to get back to adhesive dispensing you talked about some project volatility there is it your sense is it just seasonality or does it still like there s something bigger with all the trade and macro concerns out there any thoughts mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes i d say it s just typical maybe not even seasonality but just order patterns can vary year to year particularly when you think of nonwovens or larger systems orders within that part of our core adhesives business when you look at it our product assembly our packaging and our polymer businesses were up and that one happened to be down and that tends to be lumpy so i wouldn t say it s necessarily seasonality it s just a function of order patterns for our customers and i wouldn t say it s related to any sort of larger macroeconomic trend allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst ok great and then kind of similarly with the technology piece or particularly electronics obviously a really tough comparison as you think about your how the year progresses conversations relative to last year in terms of projects are we still in a similar level there mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes we have good ongoing discussions and as you know we have development projects with a lot of our customers on the electronics side of things we re getting to the point where in the next month or two we ll see whether those projects turn into real opportunities this year it s kind of the time frame where customers make those decisions i d say as we ve talked in the past we re seeing nice growth in things like the electronics area the thing that s been the swing factor has been the mobile piece and that s still not clear yet what this year looks like but if you look outside the electronics business within that segment we had a really strong first quarter in both our traditional efd business and a very very strong quarter in our medical business we expect that to continue as we go throughout the year allison poliniak wells fargo securities analyst ok thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from charlie brady with suntrust robinson your line is now open charlie brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey thanks good morning what do you expect on that last point on medical can you quantify how strong medical was in the quarter mike hilton president and chief executive officer well we expected that business to grow on a long term basis high single digit low double digits and it s it did that and a little bit more in the quarter charlie brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok good and then i guess just if i look i know you guys don t disclose the orders any longer but as sort of our back of the envelope calc it looks like orders in the quarter were down about 2 on a maybe a 25 tough comp can you give any commentary and color i suspect a lot of that was due to the on the ats side but just kind of order patterns or what you re seeing going into the current quarter is that anything really as things flipped around particularly on the lumpiness of the non woven stuff mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes i would say for most businesses we saw year on year order increases overall probably in the sort of low single digit kind of rates our backlog is up 9 but not all that s is going to get delivered in the quarter so i d say we re generally encouraged by what we see and are being consistent with the overall guidance that we provided as you know the system orders can be lumpy not only in things like nonwovens but also in some of our industrial coatings businesses and so that could vary quarter to quarter but overall we don t see anything that s inconsistent with what we think the overall top line should be for the year charlie brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok and then just to get one more from me on the you commented about the automotive sector being a little bit weaker is that a function of just what we re seeing in north american auto market in terms of sales or is it just broader overall capex going into the plants themselves mike hilton president and chief executive officer well i would say certainly what you re seeing in north america is kind of a slowdown but i d say even around the world you ve not seen significant growth on the auto side i think china in particular is probably a little bit flatter than it may have been over the last couple of years so i d say it s a sort of a global sort of auto story not a necessarily a global investment story charlie brady suntrust robinson humphrey analyst sure thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from chris dankert with longbow research your line is now open chris dankert longbow research analyst hey good morning guys mike hilton president and chief executive officer good morning chris lara mahoney vice president of corporate communications and investor relations good morning chris dankert longbow research analyst looking at the guide you guys reiterated that today kind of assumes to get back to double digit growth in ats organically kind of through the rest of the year could you kind of walk us through kind of what gives you confidence what the key drivers are there some of the new applications maybe automotive just kind of walk through what really gives you confidence in that guide in ats mike hilton president and chief executive officer well i think if you look at the total segment over half the segment now is nonelectronic a significant portion of that is medical which is growing very substantially and even the general industry s piece is growing nicely and we expect that to continue to grow within electronics even though i made the comment just previously about auto electronics or about autos the auto electronics piece is growing nicely and if you saw the comments that greg made around our test and inspection business which hit a broader market in the electronics business compared to just the mobile segments that was up nicely as well so we re seeing some good opportunities that come from our diversification effort in the electronics and in the segment in general our broader diversification into medical so we feel pretty good about the pace of business that we see here as i just said to allison the sort of development work on the mobile piece is not as clear but that s typically where we are at this time of the year chris dankert longbow research analyst got it got it that s helpful and i guess given some of the headwinds we saw in the first quarter is the target for the year still to get to that 30 margin within the adhesive dispensing that ads chunk of it mike hilton president and chief executive officer i think as i said last quarter we think ultimately we can get to 30 we didn t really commit that we d get there this year because i think we needed to complete the restructuring efforts we were talking about and then ramp up the business and improve the efficiency in the polymer side so i think ultimately that s our goal to get there i m not committing that we re going to get there this year chris dankert longbow research analyst thank you operator and our next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson your line is now open matt summerville d a davidson analyst thanks so just a question on i guess mike do you have a line of sight i heard your prepared remarks but do have a line of sight at this point at all toward whether or not you think mobile innovation will be more of an on year in fiscal 19 versus what was maybe a little bit more of an off year in fiscal 18 and can you put the context in as to sort of what s embedded in the 3 to 5 organic guide for the year is it more of an on year or more of an off year if you will mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes so what i would say if you recall in some of the last conversations we talked about what would be sort of the next more significant driver in the mobile business and we talked about things like 5g in our mind 5g is something that people are looking at this year but probably won t see a broader implementation till next year and that s kind of what we planned for so not a significant step up as associated with 5g as far as other innovations that customers are working on there are a number of things they re working on we don t have a clear line of sight about which ones they re going to implement into sort of mass production for the next set of mobile opportunities and that s why we continue to diversify across semi and across the auto electronics piece and generally across our test and inspection business as well and we ve been pretty successful in tiering to capture some of the other parts of the market so i d say it s not as clear yet on what degree of innovation our customers are going to see this year there s announcements starting to come out but it s really not clear yet in terms of what s going to go to mass production matt summerville d a davidson analyst and just as a follow up across any of your businesses at this point have you seen delays or deferrals in customer capacitization decisions particularly in asia due to either weak local demand in china or just due to the general trade uncertainty out there mike hilton president and chief executive officer i would say we haven t seen any kind of significant order cancellations or anything like that i d say there is some concern with regard to trade particularly the trade discussions with china and i would say that s top of mind for a lot of our customers that said the most recent news is encouraging we ll see if that how that plays out but i d say there s we haven t seen anything significantly canceled but i d say there is a concern both in the u s and china on that but to this point it s not having a big impact on customer decisions matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then just a follow up on medical you indicated to answering another question that that business was sort of growing organically above what you would otherwise normally expect can you talk about perhaps what s driving that is it market share related is it expanding that business internationally can you just provide some more granularity on that mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes it s really around kind of the heart of what drives all of our business which is innovation there is a lot of new products that are coming out in concert with new product introductions of our customers and so across the most of the businesses particularly the catheter businesses the cannula and catheter businesses we re seeing significant launches of new products to support customer growth and it s a continued pipeline of innovation there and as we ve made the number of acquisitions that we ve made we ve expanded our portfolio which is giving us more access to customers that they look to have a more complete shops to support them so we re certainly seeing the benefit of that so i d say it s around innovation or is in customers and it s around broadening that product portfolio and being able to take advantage of more opportunity matt summerville d a davidson analyst thanks mike mike hilton president and chief executive officer thanks matt operator thank you and our next question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer your line is now open christopher glynn oppenheimer and company analyst thank you good morning it s nice to see that diversification reading through the electronics i did have a question on coatings actually in terms of the automotive exposure there some companies are talking about reviving new platform launches in the industry after a slower 2018 independent of production just wondering if you concur and to what degree that s a driver of your coatings automotive business mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes i would say to this point that hasn t translated into significant systems orders i know there s a fair bit of discussion on that but i d say at this point it s not translated into orders now just to keep in mind this first quarter particularly for a lot of the coatings customers is a time frame where sort of at the end of january they re finalizing all their capital plans so it s not atypical for us to not see anything launched yet because they typically are calendar year and finalize their plans at the end of january or so christopher glynn oppenheimer and company analyst ok but that does play to what how you serve those markets mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes christopher glynn oppenheimer and company analyst ok great and then overall you commented on the quarterly was the first quarter was in line with your view of the year but obviously our sell side models were uniformly didn t quite capture the seasonal deleverage all that well so just wondering if any fine point considerations on how we view the split of the first half and second half and really any wisdom on how the second quarter bridges to the full year given that we kind of didn t quite manage all that well the first quarter with the change from quarterly to annual guidance mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes i would say that just a couple of things first of all i think the one thing i ll get to the top line comment in a minute but the one thing that just to think through is knowing that we have sort of a seasonal business our sort of sales and administrative costs don t typically vary tremendously throughout the year so that s maybe it varies a few million quarter to quarter maybe it s a little higher ultimately in the end of the year depending on how the year plays out but it doesn t typically vary that much which is great when we look at incremental volume and the incremental margins are going up and obviously if the volumes going down unfortunately that we see that as well so i would say that s one thing to focus in on now on the top line we would expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half obviously first quarter is down but we would expect to see seasonal growth in the second half of the year that would be stronger than we see in the first half our backlog as i said earlier is up 9 but all of that s not going to go out in the quarter so obviously we expect to see improvement in the second quarter but more improvement in the second half of the year christopher glynn oppenheimer and company analyst got it thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matt trusz with gabelli research your line is now open matt trusz gabelli research analyst good morning thank you for taking my question mike hilton president and chief executive officer good morning matt trusz gabelli research analyst so within the mobile phone exposure can you get a little more granular about what changes trigger a customer need for new nordson equipment so like for example with waterproofing or 5g there s a new hardware feature or a fundamental change to form factor requires new gear but when we re thinking about iterative type of model updates does that really require much new nordson equipment mike hilton president and chief executive officer so if you think about the things that drive it it s change in general so it could be shape factor in there it could be something like making it thinner or expanding battery size which squeezes everything else that s been a benefit in the past it could be features things like the thumbprint recognition or any other type of sensing technology or it could be process changes so waterproofing would fall into a process change with 5g the reason that we point to that is that it ll leave more antennas within the phone and as a result of that you re going to have less space but as i said earlier we don t really expect that to be a significant change until the until 2020 so it could be all of those things including process changes in the way our customers manufacture the phones so we have a variety of different things that we re working on there greg thaxton executive vice president and chief financial officer matt this is greg what i d add to that is oftentimes when we see a new feature finding its way into these devices we get it we get the added benefit of we re often working at the module level with those suppliers either with our dispensing equipment or our inspection equipment and then working at the assembly level where the module gets integrated into the device mike hilton president and chief executive officer that said one of things we continue to try to do as i mentioned earlier diversify across different applications whether it s in the semi side whether it s on the auto side whether it s in the electric battery batteries for electric car space we re trying to diversify so we re not as dependent there on the mobile phone space matt trusz gabelli research analyst that s very interesting and then just wondering overall how you would characterize your general level of business confidence and your sense of your customers confidence and whether your answer today would be any different than it would ve been two quarters ago thank you mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes i would say it s pretty consistent i think as we talked last quarter we expected global growth this year to be a little less than global growth last year and so i d say we re still seeing that is consistent so i d say it play out with our expectations i mean i think somebody asked earlier about trade that s sort of the one wild card that s out there if there was a significant trade war well then that would have some more implications if the trade issues particularly with china get resolved in a positive manner we could see some uptick there but i d say our view of the macro environment is where we thought it was going to be at sort of the tail end of last year with growth globally but slower and that s i think what we see today as well matt trusz gabelli research analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks good morning mike hilton president and chief executive officer good morning walter walter liptak seaport global analyst wanted to ask try one on geographic basis the japan market s down and i just wonder if you could if you can talk a little bit about the sectors that led to the decline in japan and kind of visibility what would be the expectation because i think the comps get a little bit easier as you go on throughout the year mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes if you look at japan it s all year over year comparisons walt and it was largely the significant electronics orders that we got that in the fourth quarter really of 17 that it also came in in the first quarter of 18 and that happened to be through a japanese supplier although the end customers for those products were across the portfolio of mobile as well as some other opportunities so that s that really explains the what s going on in japan year over year and i d say the first quarter in japan is more typical than we expect in japan as compared to last year so won t read anything more into that other than just what i said now i think we have said at the beginning of the year that we expect europe and japan to grow this year but slower than they did last year and that s still our expectation walter liptak seaport global analyst ok ok good and yes that was the next question it s just doing the same thing in europe i mean we ve heard about european auto slowing germany and i wonder what the visibility was like in europe and kind of the expectations those comps i think stay a little bit more difficult throughout the year but what are your thoughts on some of the systems businesses in europe mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes i would say it kind of lines up with the economy in terms of just a slower growth year i mean you see it in germany you see it in france it s going to be a slower growth year we ll see if brexit has any particular impact we don t expect it to have a big impact for us but i think in general it s affecting the economies we talked earlier about nonwovens one of the big non wovens oems happens to be located in europe so you could see some impact there depending on how that project level comes back throughout the year but certainly that s had some impact walter liptak seaport global analyst ok so considering some of these international slowdown issues when we think about the self help that you re doing for this year and the margin improvement what are the factors that provide that range of operating margin improvement what does it take to get to the high end of that range and what kind of assumptions go into the low end mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes well first of all i think we ve talked about the restructuring efforts we had under way in the polymer part of our adhesives business so we re essentially through that in this quarter and we ll start to see some improvement as we go through the year we also had some investment in setting up our customer service our shared service center activity in the u s that ll go away so there s a some both expense that goes away and some benefits we ll see from finishing those projects we have a number of things that we re driving on our continuous improvement activities through nordson business system that we think will help from the overall cost side and then we do expect the volume to come in at the levels that we have talked about and we ll get the volume leverage on that so those are the major factors that would drive the margin improvement that we re looking for greg thaxton executive vice president and chief financial officer walt this is greg one way that i d characterize this is to say there s no one big aspect of this initiative that s going to deliver the bulk of it it s going to be as we see across most of our years it s a lot of singles and doubles that add up to generate this kind of improvement walter liptak seaport global analyst ok and it sounds like the swing factor here is the volume leverage that a number of these things are within your control but it s where does the revenue come in to get leverage off of that mike hilton president and chief executive officer i mean you know our incremental margins are pretty high so even with the sort of the 3 to 5 kind of growth targets that we ve talked about there s pretty good leverage on that so you re correct greg thaxton executive vice president and chief financial officer but some of those comments that mike made kind of go hand in hand with the volume the point here is as we grow that top line we believe we re going to do it in a more efficient way because of some of these structural changes that we ve made walter liptak seaport global analyst ok ok great thank you guys operator thank you and our next question comes from jason rodgers with great lakes review your line is now open jason rodgers great lakes review analyst yes good morning mike hilton president and chief executive officer good morning jason rodgers great lakes review analyst just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the growth expectations by segment to reach your full year guidance does the guidance assume that you re going to realize some of these large system orders in nonwovens in ads and then looking at the ats segment given that the mobile side possibly may not see robust growth until next year and then some slower growth regionally i m just looking for some more detail on areas of growth in addition to medical in that segment that can get you to the levels that you need to reach that 3 to 5 your full year growth guidance mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes so what i would say is a couple of things one we do expect all of our segments to grow this year two within those segments we probably have 25 to 30 different product lines and in any one year you re not going to have 100 of them grow and we don t necessarily count on 100 of them growing but as we look at the various drivers across each of the businesses we feel confident enough in the things that we re doing with innovation with new applications and products and taking advantage through our tiering structure of new markets that we re going to be able to generate that kind of growth that we ve put out there so i think all segments we would expect to grow but honestly all product lines but that s typical of any year that we have jason rodgers great lakes review analyst ok and looking at the share repurchase stepped that up in the quarter wanted to get your thoughts on future repurchases mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes well let me start sort of the high well our capital allocation priorities haven t changed it s to support the organic growth of the business it s to continue our dividend string it s to look to add to our portfolio with appropriate acquisitions and it s really done to be more opportunistic on the share repurchase and that s what we ve done in this past quarter in particular as being opportunistic around the share repurchase so end of day that s still our priorities and we feel like as greg mentioned that we ve got capacity to acquire some additional businesses we ve got a pipeline that we re working but you never can tell when those things are going to come to market so we maintain these priorities to appropriately allocate the capital for the greatest benefit to the company and our shareholders greg thaxton executive vice president and chief financial officer and i d add that in terms of part of that share buyback part of our baseline strategy is to offset the dilutive effect of benefit plans so we ve been able to accomplish that with this activity jason rodgers great lakes review analyst ok thank you mike hilton president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets your line is now open jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys mike hilton president and chief executive officer hey jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just wanted to come back to the non i guess the areas where you re seeing lumpiness i guess the nonwovens and then the pieces of coatings can you just talk about what you saw in terms of order activity in coating that kind of give you confidence you ll get maybe some good lumpiness back as you move through the year mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes what i would say is we ve got activities going across all of those businesses and product lines around the globe we just can t necessarily predict when customers are going to place orders i would say on the auto side it s been softer for a while and so we re not necessarily counting on that to step up in a big way we have our normal run rate business that comes from our installed base there in the parts and consumables and smaller projects i m not sure that we re betting on significant large platforms to come through in the year and i d say on the nonwovens we ve had really strong years over the last three or four years and we ll continue to have some opportunities here this year but it s kind of hard to place the timing on those things because they tend also to be also shorter delivery type projects as well jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst ok and then just mike hilton president and chief executive officer what s important let me just add what s important is as we as i mentioned earlier we ve got a lot of different product lines going into a lot of different markets and applications and this one is a little softer we expect some others to pick up and we ve highlighted a few so far jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst ok great and then just kind of back on the cadence question as we head into 2q do you find 2q kind of at least kind of falls into the range of the full year kind of growth guidance mike hilton president and chief executive officer yes so what we ve said is we expect sequentially for things to pick up and the second half to be stronger than the first half and some improvement in the second quarter so yes we expect some positive improvement in the second quarter but as we as i commented earlier with our backlog up 9 we don t necessarily expect that to translate into the quarter jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst ok thanks guys mike hilton president and chief executive officer thank you operator and that does conclude today s question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back to mike hilton for any further remarks mike hilton president and chief executive officer i d just say thank you to all of those who have participated today and

the march 1 deadline for a trade deal between washington and beijing is now just a week away and traders and investors continue to be riveted in their watch for developments in negotiations president trump is scheduled to meet with china s top trade negotiator today as the world s top two economies continue trying to hash out a deal the meeting comes a day after reuters reported that negotiators from the united states and china had begun to outline commitments in principle on the thorniest issues in the trade dispute the market seems optimistic about the high level talks and without major economic data reports today it seems likely that the focus could remain on potential progress in a trade dispute that has affected billions of dollars in global trade and inflamed fears of slowing global economic growth most major overseas indices were higher overnight on optimism that the tariff talks will have positive results and it s also interesting to note that trade sensitive stocks such as boeing co ba and caterpillar inc cat are doing well apparently amid the positive sentiment on a trade deal permeating the wider stock market given the good vibes it s perhaps not surprising that wall street s main fear gauge the cboe volatility index vix is lower currently below 15 that may change if we don t see news on progress later today see more on the vix in the chart below woes for kraft heinz in company specific news this morning kraft heinz co khc shares plunged more than 26 in pre market trade after the packaged goods company shaved billions off the value of some of its top brands including oscar mayer and kraft in total khc knocked 15 4 billion off the goodwill value of some of its assets as it reported lower than expected q4 results which included a net loss of 12 6 billion investors had further cause for alarm with its new dividend down by about a third to 40 cents per share khc was on track to open at a record low since the company was created from a 2015 merger backed by warren buffett compounding its woes khc also revealed it s the subject of an investigation by the securities and exchange commission which is looking into its accounting practices economic data in focus while the economic data calendar is light several fed officials are scheduled to speak today market participants will have the chance to parse comments from presidents of the new york san francisco and st louis feds as well as the philadelphia fed chairman the speeches come on the heels of minutes from the last fed meeting that showed the central bank seems to think the global economy is slowing fed participants noted softer consumer and business sentiment along with weak foreign economies see more on consumer sentiment below that sentiment seemed to be borne out thursday as economic numbers out of the u s and europe seemed to provide a counterpoint to optimism about the progress on a trade deal fears about a protracted trade war harming global economic growth have hounded stock market investors and traders for months and have ratcheted up as economic data have begun pointing to slowing growth in china europe and the united states but investor optimism has seemed to be growing that the world s two largest economies can hammer out a deal before the deadline when u s tariffs on certain chinese goods are scheduled to increase from 10 to 25 it was data that seemed to take the spotlight on thursday overseas an ihs markit report for february showed that its manufacturing purchasing managers index for the euro zone slipped into contractionary territory on this side of the pond economic data was not stellar and the lackluster figures perhaps provided an excuse for a bit of profit taking after the gains we ve seen recently the monthly report on durable goods orders from the census bureau showed headline orders in december rose 1 2 slightly behind the briefing com consensus expectation of 1 3 but excluding transportation orders rose just 0 1 when a 0 2 rise had been expected and when you look at the numbers for core capital goods which don t include defense related orders or aircraft the reading showed a decline of 0 7 and a downwardly revised 1 for november those latter figures showed that business investment remained weak briefing com said manufacturing data out of the northeast wasn t great either with a february index from the philadelphia fed for february unexpectedly falling to 4 1 when a reading of 12 had been forecast in a briefing com consensus meanwhile the leading economic indicators index from the conference board unexpectedly dropped in january falling 0 1 instead of posting a 0 1 rise as expected in a briefing com consensus housing data also continued to be problematic as a report on existing home sales showed a decline in january to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 94 million when a briefing com consensus had expected a rise to 5 05 million one bright spot in the data stream came as initial claims for unemployment benefits declined more than expected to 216 000 and continuing claims also fell the data showed that the jobs market remains tight that can be a signal of economic strength though it can also help increase inflationary pressures crude oil prices sank along with stocks amid the risk off mood as the lackluster economic data seemed to sap investor and trader confidence in demand for oil government data that showed a build in u s crude oil inventories also appeared to pressure crude futures but the bearish sentiment comes against a backdrop of support for the oil market from opec led supply cuts and sanctions on iran and venezuela perhaps the progress on trade talks also helped keep oil s losses in check gdp forecast trimmed after disappointing durable goods figures yesterday at least one measure of expected q4 gross domestic product has slipped the atlanta fed s gdpnow forecast for q4 seasonally adjusted annual gdp growth dropped to 1 4 thursday from 1 5 on feb 14 the nowcast for expected q4 real nonresidential equipment investment growth declined to 3 9 from 4 5 after thursday morning s durable manufacturing report the government s first official estimate of q4 gdp is scheduled for release from the bureau of economic analysis on feb 28 consumer expectations decline although the headline number on the conference board s leading economic indicators didn
