yves here another meaty michael hudson interview on guns and butter however i have to vehemently disagree with the claim made by bonnie faulkner at the top of the discussion no one holds guns to other countries heads to make them hold dollars the reason the dollar is the reserve currency is the us is willing to export jobs via running persistent trade deficits the us moved away from having rising worker wages as the key metric of sound economic policy in the 1970s when labor was blamed for stagflation too powerful unions supposedly hobbling us manufactures when the performance of toyota at the famed nummi joint venture showed that to be false formal or informal cost of living adjustments to pay credited with institutionalizing inflation recall also that the democrats had started to abandon labor unions even before that anyone who runs a trade surplus with the us winds up holding dollars the idea that china holds a lot of dollars because us diplomats browbeat them is absurd china can hold its dollars as cash or it can put them in treasuries and pick up some yield or hold riskier dollar investments if it sells its dollars and buys other currencies it will at the margin drive the dollar down and push its currency up which would hurt its competitiveness in exports which contradicts its imperative of keeping employment high and using trade surpluses to help achieve that end most countries as a matter of policy actually do or aspire to running trade surpluses because they get the mirror image they can achieve higher employment levels than they would if they relied only on domestic demand smaller economies can and regularly do get themselves in trouble by borrowing in dollars because the borrowing rate at the time appeared to be lower than in their own currency this pretty much always ends in tears because the home currency depreciates greatly raising the cost of the formerly cheap dollar loan however it is true that having established the dollar as the reserve currency and further going to considerable lengths to make the world safe for us banks and investment banks the us is now thuggish in how it uses its influence over the dollar payments system no major financial institution can afford to be cut off from dollar clearing from guns and butter produced by bonnie faulkner yarrow mahko and tony rango visit them at gunsandbutter org to listen to past

university of missouri kansas city his most recent books include and forgive them their debts lending foreclosure and redemption from bronze age finance to the jubilee year killing the host how financial parasites and debt destroy the global economy and j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception we return again today to a discussion of dr hudson s seminal 1972 book super imperialism the economic strategy of american empire a critique of how the united states exploited foreign economies through the imf and world bank we discuss how the united states has dominated the world economically both as the world s largest creditor and then later as the world s largest debtor and take a look at the coming demise of dollar domination bonnie faulkner michael hudson welcome back michael hudson it s good to be back bonnie bonnie faulkner why is president trump insisting that the federal reserve lower interest rates i thought they were already extremely low and if they did go lower what effect would this have michael hudson interest rates are historically low and they have been kept low in order to try to keep providing cheap money for speculators to buy stocks and bonds to make arbitrage gains speculators can borrow at a low rate of interest to buy a stock yielding dividends and also making capital gains at a higher rate of return or by buying a bond such as corporate junk bonds that pay higher interest rates and keep the difference in short low interest rates are a form of financial engineering trump wants interest rates to be low in order to inflate the housing market and the stock market even more as if that is an index of the real economy not just the financial sector that is wrapped around the economy of production and consumption beyond this domestic concern trump imagines that if you keep interest rates lower than those of europe the dollar s exchange rate will decline he thinks that this will make u s exports more competitive with foreign products trump is criticizing the federal reserve for not keeping interest rates even lower than those of europe he he thinks that if interest rates are low there will be an outflow of capital from this country to buy foreign stocks and bonds that pay a higher interest rate this financial outflow will lower the dollar s exchange rate he believes that this will increase the chance of rebuilding america s manufacturing exports this is the great neoliberal miscalculation it also is the basis for imf models how low interest rates lower the dollar s exchange rate raising import prices trump s guiding idea is that lowering the dollar s value will lower the cost of labor to employers that s what happens when a currency is devalued depreciation doesn t lower costs that have a common worldwide price there s a common price for oil in the world a common price of raw materials and pretty much a common price for capital and credit so the main thing that s devalued when you push a currency down is the price of labor and its working conditions workers are squeezed when a currency s exchange rate falls because they have to pay more for goods they import if the dollar goes down against the chinese yen or european currency chinese imports are going to cost more in dollars so will european imports that is the logic behind beggar my neighbor devaluations how much more foreign imports will cost depends on how far the dollar goes down but even if it plunges by 50 percent even if the dollar were to become a junk currency like the argentinian or other latin american currencies that cannot really increase american manufacturing exports because not much american labor works in factories anymore workers drive cabs and work in the service industry or for medical insurance companies even if you give american workers in manufacturing companies all their clothing and food for nothing they still can t compete with foreign countries because their housing costs are so high their medical insurance is so high and their taxes are so high that they re priced out of world markets so it won t help much if the dollar goes down by 1 percent 10 percent or even 20 percent if you don t have factories going and if you don t have a transportation system a power supply and if our public utilities and infrastructure are being run down there s nothing that currency manipulation can do to enable america to quickly rebuild its manufacturing export industries american parent companies have already moved their factories abroad they have given up on america as long as trump or his successors refrain from changing that system as long as he gives tax advantages for companies to move abroad there s nothing he can do that will restore industry here but he s picked up international monetary fund s junk economics the neoliberal patter talk that it s given to latin america pretending that if a country just lowers its exchange rate more it will be able to lower its wages and living standards paying labor less in hard currency terms until at some point when its poverty and austerity get deep enough it will become more competitive that hasn t worked for fifty years in latin america it hasn t worked for other countries either and it never worked in the united states the 19th century american school of political economy developed the economy of high wages doctrine i review this in my book on america s protectionist takeoff 1815 1914 they recognized that if you pay labor more it s more productive it can afford a better education and it works better that s why high wage labor can undersell low wage pauper labor trump is therefore a century behind the times in picking up the imf austerity idea that you can just devalue the currency and reduce labor s wages and living standards in international terms to make the economy more profitable and somehow work your way out of debt what currency depreciation does do when the dollar is devalued is to enable wall street firms to borrow 1 and to buy european currencies and bonds yielding 3 percent or 4 percent or 5 percent or stocks yielding even more the guiding idea is to do what japan did in 1990 have very low interest rates to increase what s called the carry trade the carry trade is borrowing at a low interest rate and buying bonds yielding a higher rate making an arbitrage gain on the interest rate differential so trump is creating an arbitrage opportunity for wall street investors he pretends that this is pro labor and can rebuild manufacturing but it only helps hollow out the u s economy sending money to other countries to build themup instead of investing in ourselves so the effect of what trump s doing is the opposite of what he says he s doing bonnie faulkner exactly what is the point of driving investment into foreign countries away from the united states michael hudson if you re an investor you can make more money by dismantling the u s economy you can borrow at 1 percent and buy a bond or a stock that yields 3 or 4 percent that s called arbitrage it s a financial free lunch the effect of this free lunch as you say is to build up foreign economies or at least their financial markets while undercutting your own finance is cosmopolitan not patriotic it doesn t really care where it makes money finance goes wherever the rate of return is highest that s the dynamic that has been de industrializing the united states over the past forty years bonnie faulkner from what you re saying it sounds like donald trump s policies are leading to doing to the united states what the imf and world bank have traditionally done to foreign economies michael hudson that s what happens when you devalue the financial sector will see that interest rates are going down so the dollar s exchange rate also will decline investors will move their money or will borrow into euros gold or japanese yen or swiss francs whose exchange rate is expected to rise so you re offering a financial arbitrage and capital gain for investors who speculate in foreign currencies you re also hollowing out the economy here and squeezing real wage levels and living standards why devaluation will not help re industrialize the u s economy bonnie faulkner do you think that donald trump understands what he s doing michael hudson i don t think he understands i think he has an oversimplified view of how the world works he thinks that if we devalue the dollar we can undersell china and europe but you can only undersell them if you have car making factories available if you don t have a factory you re not going to be able to undersell foreign carmakers no matter how low the dollar goes and if you don t have a set of computer manufacturing factories and local suppliers already in the united states you re not going to have production capacity able to undersell china most of all you need public infrastructure and affordable housing education and health care so trump s view is a fantasy it s like saying if we had some ham we could have some ham and eggs if we had some eggs it leaves the causes of america s de industrialization out of account if we had unemployed car makers computer makers and other manufacturers here factories that were idle in an economy that was pretty competitive then devaluation might make some sense but americans are not just a bit uncompetitive the housing costs in america are so high the medical and health insurance costs the taxes and wage withholding on labor and prices for basic infrastructure that there s no way that we can compete with foreign countries simply by currency manipulation since 1980 the u s economy has been made very high cost yet there also has been a huge squeeze on labor by raising the prices it has to pay for basic needs even if wages go up people can t afford to live as well as they did thirty years ago a radical restructuring is needed in order to restore a full employment industrial economy you need de privatization you have to break up monopolies you need the kind of economy and economic reform that america had under franklin roosevelt in the 1930s i don t see that happening bonnie faulkner do you think that donald trump was installed as u s president to oversee the bankruptcy of the united states and dismantling the u s empire michael hudson nobody installed him he installed himself i don t think most people expected him to win if you look at the odds that professional bookies and oddsmakers gave from the time he announced his candidacy most people thought that sleepy jeb bush would get the nomination and that bush then would lose to hillary so there were indeed attempts an attempt to install hillary or bush but nobody tried to install trump he made an end run around them by straight talk humor and celebrityhood he didn t have advisors that he would listen to because he s always been a one man show and he doesn t really know what he s doing economically he knows how to cheat people victimize suppliers and how to make money in real estate simply by not paying suppliers and by borrowing from banks and not paying them but he has no idea that you can t run an economy this way being a real estate mafioso isn t the same thing as running a whole economy trump has no idea and i don t think anyone knows how to control him except maybe fox news wall street vs the real economy which turns out to be more real bonnie faulkner what is going on with the ruling class in the united states does anybody in its ranks know how to run an economy michael hudson the problem is that running an economy to help the people and raise living standards and even to lower the cost of living and doing business means not running it to help wall street if someone knows how to run an economy the financial sector wants to keep them out of any public office high finance is short term not long term it plays the hit and run game not the much harder task of creating a framework for tangible economic growth you can do one of two things you can help labor or you can help wall street if running the economy means helping labor and improving living standards by giving better medical care this is going to be at the expense of the financial sector and short term corporate profits so the last thing you want to do is have somebody run the economy for its own prosperity instead of for wall street s purpose at issue is who s going to do the planning will it be elected public officials in the government or wall street wall street s public relations office is the university of chicago it claims that a free market is one where rich wall street investors and the financial class run an economy but if you let people vote and democratically elect governments to regulate that s called interference in a free market this is the fight that trump has against china he wants to tell it to let the banks run china and have a free market he says that china has grown rich over the last fifty years by unfair means with government help and public enterprise in effect he wants chinese to be as threatened and insecure as american workers they should get rid of their public transportation they should get rid of their subsidies they should let a lot of their companies go bankrupt so that americans can buy them they should have the same kind of free market that has wrecked the us economy china doesn t want that kind of a free market of course it does have a market economy it is actually much like the united states was in its 19th century industrial takeoff with strong government subsidy u s changing monetary strategy from payments surplus to deficit status bonnie faulkner in your seminal work from 1972 super imperialism the economic strategy of american empire you write whereas us domination of the world economy stemmed from 1920 through 1960 from its creditor position its control since the 1960s has stemmed from is debtor position not only have the tables been turned but us diplomats have found that their leverage as the world s major debtor economy is fully as strong as that which formerly had reflected its net creditor position this sounds counter intuitive could you break it down let s start with 1920 through 1960 how was the united states able to dominate the world economy from its creditor position michael hudson the u s creditor position really began after world war i based on the money it lent to the allies before it joined the war when the war ended u s diplomats told england and france to pay us for the arms they had bought early on but in the past for centuries the victors usually forgave all the debts among each other once a war was over for the first time america insisted that the allies pay for the military support it had sold them before joining them the european allies were pretty devastated by the war and they turned to germany and insisted on reparations that quickly bankrupted germany german bankrupted its economy trying to pay england and france which simply sent it on to pay the united states their balance of payments was in deficit and their currencies weregoing down american investors saw an opportunity to buy up their industry gold was the measure of power the backing for domestic money and credit and hence capital investment america was much more productive not having suffered war damage here between the end of world war ii and 1950 when the korean war broke out america accumulated over 75 percent of the world s monetary gold the united states had heavy agricultural exports growing industrial exports and enough money to buy up the leading industries of europe and latin america and other countries but beginning in 1950 with the korean war the u s balance of payments moved into deficit for the first time it got even worse when president eisenhower decided that america had to support french colonialism in southeast asia in french indochina vietnam and laos by the time the vietnam war escalated in the 1960s the dollar was running large balance of payments deficits every week on wall street we would watch the gold supply go down losing gold to countries that weren t at war like france and germany they were cashing in the excess dollars that were being spent by the u s military by the 1960s it became clear that america was on a trajectory to run out of gold within a decade because of this overseas war spending it finally did by august 1971when president nixon stopped selling bold on the london exchange and the price was allowed to soar far above 35 an ounce the u s balance of payments was still running a deep deficit because of the fighting in southeast asia and elsewhere creating a permanent balance of payments deficit the private sector was just in balance during the 1950s and 1960s the entire deficit was military when america went off gold people began to wonder what was going to happen many predicted an economic doomsday it was losing its ability to rule the world through gold but what i realized and was the first to publish was that if countries no longer could buy and hold gold in their international reserves what werethey going to hold there was only one asset that they could hold u s government securities that is treasury bonds a treasury bond is a loan to the us treasury when a foreign central bank buys a bond it finances the domestic u s budget deficit so the balance of payments deficit ends up financing the domestic budget deficit the result is a circular flow of military spending recycled by foreign central banks after 1971 the united states continued to spend abroad militarily and in 1974 the opec countries quadrupled the price of oil at that time the united states told saudi arabia that it could charge whatever it wanted for its oil but it had to recycle all its net dollar earnings the saudis were not to buy gold the saudis were told that it would be an act of war if they didn t recycle into the american economy the dollars they received for their oil exports they were encouraged to buy u s treasury bonds but could also buy other u s bonds and stocks to help push up the stock and bond markets here while supporting the dollar the united states kept its own gold stock while wanting the rest of the world to hold its savings in the form of loans to the united states so the dollar didn t go down other countries that were receiving dollars simply recycled them to buy u s financial securities what would have happened if they wouldn t have done this let s say you re germany france or japan if you don t recycle your dollar receipts back to the u s economy your currency is going to go up dollar inflows from export sales are being converted into your currency increasing its exchange rate but by buying u s bonds or stocks bid the price of dollars back up against your own currency so when the united states runs a balance of payments deficit under conditions where other countries keep their foreign reserves in dollars the effect is for other countries to keep their currencies exchange rates stable mainly by lending to the u s government that gives the united states a free ride it can encircle the world with military bases and the dollars that this costs are returned to the united states imagine writing ious when you go out to spend at a store or restaurant but your ious are never going to be collected the store might say we have an iou from bonnie faulkner let s keep it as our savings instead of putting it in the bank or asking for payment in real money we re just going to keep collecting these ious from bonnie faulkner corporations call such ious and trade credit receivables now suppose you went on a spending spree and gave the store a billion dollars worth of your ious there s no way that you could pay off this billion dollars in that case the stores receiving these ious would say well we really don t want to foreclose on bonnie because we know that she can t pay we d lose the value of receivables on the asset side of our balance sheet all these ious that we ve been collecting that s essentially what foreign countries are saying about their buildup of dollars the u s position is in effect that we are not going to repay any foreign country the dollar debt we owe them as treasury secretary john connolly said it s our dollars but your problem other countries have to pay us or else we ll bomb them the military dimension to this arrangement is the u s position that it would be an act of war if other countries don t keep spending their export earnings on loans or u s stocks and bonds that s what makes the united states the exceptional country the value of our currency is based on other countries savings the money they save has to be held in the form of dollars or securities that we re never going to repay even if we could this is a huge free ride you d think that donald trump would want to keep it going but he claims that china is manipulating its currency by recycling its dollars into loans to the u s treasury what does he mean by that china is earning a lot of dollars by exports its goods to the united states what does it do with these dollars it tried to do what america did with europe and south america it tried to buy american companies but the united states blocked it from doing this on specious national security grounds the government claims that our national security would be threatened if china would buy a chain of filling stations as it wanted to do in california the united states thus has a double standard claiming that it is threatened if china buys any company but insisting on its right to buy out the commanding heights of foreign economies with its electronic dollar credit that leaves china with only one option it can buy u s treasury bonds lending its export earnings to the u s treasury trump is now driving other countries out of the dollar orbit china now realizes that the u s treasury isn t going to repay even if it wanted to recycle its export earnings into treasury bonds or u s stocks and bonds or real estate donald trump now is saying that he doesn t want china to support the dollar s exchange rate and keep its own exchange rate down by buying u s assets we re telling china not to do what we ve told other countries to do for the past forty years to buy u s securities trump accuses countries of artificial currency manipulation if they keep their foreign reserves in dollars so he s telling them and specifically china to get rid of their dollar holdings not to buy dollars with their export earnings anymore so china is buying gold russia also is buying gold and much of the world is now in the process of reverting to the gold exchange standard meaning that gold is used to settle international payments imbalances but is not connected to domestic money creation countries realize that there s a great advantage of the gold exchange standard there s only a limited amount of gold in the world s central banks this means that any country that wages war is going to run such a large balance of payments deficit that it s going to lose its gold reserves so reviving the role of gold may prevent any country including the united states from going to war and suffering a military deficit the irony is that trump is breaking up america s financial free ride its policy of monetary imperialism by telling counties to stop recycling their dollar inflows they ve got to de dollarize their economies the effect is to make these economies independent of the united states trump already has announced that we won t hire chinese in our it sectors or let chinese study subjects at university that might enable them to rival us so our economies are going to separate in effect trump has said that if we can t win in a trade deal if we can t make other countries lose and become more dependent on u s suppliers and monopoly pricing then we re not going to sign an agreement this stance is driving not only china but russia and even europe and other countries all out of the u s orbit the end result is going to be that the united states is going to be isolated without being able to manufacture like it used to do it s dismantled its manufacturing so how willit get by some population figures were released a week ago showing the middle of america is emptying out the population is moving from the midwestern and mountain states to the east and the west coasts and the gulf coast so trump s policies are accelerating the de industrialization of the united states without doing anything to put new productive powers in place and not even wanting other countries to invest here the german car companies see trump putting tariffs on the imported steel they need to build cars in the united states it built them here to get around america s tariff barriers against german and other automobiles but now trump is not even letting them import the parts that they need to assemble these cars in the non unionized plants they ve built in the south what can they do perhaps they ll propose a trade with general motors and chrysler the europeans will get the factories that american companies own in europe and give them their american factories in exchange this kind of split is occurring without any attempt to make american labor more competitive by lowering its cost of housing or the price of its health insurance and medical care or its transportation costs or the infrastructure costs so america is being left high and dry as a high priced economy in a nationalistic world while running a huge balance of payments deficit to support its military spending all over the globe bonnie faulkner so it sounds like when the united states went off the gold standard the dollar basically replaced gold as the main asset in which foreign governments could hold their assets now you re saying that when there was no more gold standard if foreign economies didn t buy u s treasuries the price of their currency would rise and make them uncompetitive michael hudson yes imagine if americans would have to pay more and more dollars to buy german cars there s going to be a larger demand for german currency the euro whose exchange rate would rise that was happening throughout the 1960s and 1970s before the euro the only way that germany could keep down the value of its mark was to buy something that cost dollars it didn t buy american exports because america already was making and exporting less and less except for food and germany can only eat so much wheat and soybeans so the only thing that germany could buy that was priced in dollars were u s treasury bonds that kept the german mark from rising even more rapidly and kept the balance of payments in balance japan had a similar problem the japanese tried to buy u s real estate but they didn t have any idea of what made real estate valuable here they lost a reported billion dollars on buying rockefeller center not realizing that the building was separate from the land value and the land was owned by columbia university the building itself was running at a deficit most of the rental value paid was to the owner of the land s groundrent the japanese had no idea of how american real estate worked the euro is only a satellite currency of the u s dollar some americans worried that the euro might become a rival to the dollar after all europe is not de industrializing it is moving forward and producing better cars airplanes and other exports so the united states persuaded foreign politicians to cripple the euro by making it an austerity currency creating so few government bonds that there s no euro vehicle large enough for foreign countries to keep their foreign reserves in the united states can create more and more dollar debt by running a budget deficit we can follow keynesian policies by running a deficit to employ more labor but the eurozone refuses to let countries run a budget deficit of more than 3 percent of its gdp now running more than 3 percent of their gdp that level is very marginal compared to the united states and if you re trying not to run any deficit at all and even if you keep it less than 3 then you re imposing austerity on your country keeping your employment down you re stifling your internal market cutting your throat by being unable to create a real rival to the dollar that s why donald rumsfeld called europe a dead zone and why the only alternatives for a rival currency are the chinese yuan they re moving into a gold based currency area along with russia iran and other members of the shanghai cooperation organization bonnie faulkner the european union not allowing european countries within the eurozone to not run deficits more than 3 percent was basically cutting their own throat why would they do such a thing michael hudson because the heads of the central bank are fighting a class war they look at themselves as financial generals in the economic fight against labor to hurt the working class lower wages and help their political constituency the wealthy investing class europe always has had a more vicious class war than the united states does it s never really emerged from its aristocratic post feudal system its central bankers and universities follow the university of chicago free market school saying that the way to get rich is to make your labor poorer and to create a government where labor doesn t have a voice that s europe s economic philosophy and it s why europe has not matched the growth that china and other countries are experiencing bonnie faulkner so it sounds like then the united states has been able to dominate the world economy since 1971 from a debtor position michael hudson when it was losing gold from 1950 to 1971 that wasn t dominating that was losing america s gold supply to france germany japan and other countries only when it stopped the gold exchange standard and left countries with no alternative for their international savings but to buy u s treasury bonds or other securities was it able to pay for its military spending without losing its power since 1971 world diplomacy has essentially been backed by american military power it s not a free market military power keeps countries in a financial strait jacket in which the united states can run into debt without having to repay it other countries that run payments deficits are not allowed to expand their economies either to rival the united states or even to improve living standards for their labor force only countries outside the u s orbit china and in principle russia and some other countries in asia are able to increase their living standards and capital investment and technology by being free of this globalized financial class war bonnie faulkner in super imperialismyou write that pressures to create a new international economic order collapsed by the end of the 1970s are you saying that other countries simply gave up and acquiesced to american monetary imperialism what happened michael hudson i m told that there was wholesale bribery officials in the reagan administration told me that they just paid off foreign officials to support the u s position not a new international economic order u s agencies maneuvered within the party politics of european and near eastern countries to promote pro american officials and sideline those who did not agree to act as u s satellites a lot of money was involved in this meddling so the united stateshas corrupted democratic politics throughout europe and the near east and much of asia that has succeeded in sterilizing foreign independence in the united states meanwhile thatcher s and reagan s neoliberal ideas were promoted instead of the kind of mixed economy that roosevelt and social democracy had been pressing for fifty years who will plan economies financial managers or democratic governments bonnie faulkner if there were pressures to create a new international economic order in the 1970s what was this new order looking to achieve michael hudson other countries wanted to do for their economies what the united states has long done for its own economy to use their governments deficit spending to build up their infrastructure raise living standards create housing and promote progressive taxation that would prevent a rentierclass a landlord and financial class from taking over economic management in the financial field they wanted governments to create their own money to promote their own development just like the united states does the role of neoliberalism was the opposite it was to promote the financial and real estate sector and monopolies to take economic management away from government so the real question from the 1980s on was about who would be the basic planning center of society would it be the financial sector the banks and bondholders whose interest is really the one percent that own most of the banks bonds and stocks or is it going to be governments trying to subsidize the economy to help the 99 percent grow and prosper that was the social democratic view opposed by thatcherism and reaganism the international drive to de dollarize bonnie faulkner was this pressure that blocked a new international economic order brought on by the united states going off the gold exchange standard michael hudson no it was a reaction against the u s policy of siphoning off the commanding heights of foreign economies the united states wants to control their raw materials exports especially their oil and gas it wants to control their financial system so that all of their economic gains will go to foreign investors mainly u s investors it wants to turn other economies into service economies to the united states and to make them into a kind of super nato military alliance that will oppose any country that does not want to be part of the u s centered unilateral global order bonnie faulkner how does today s monetary imperialism super imperialism differ from the imperialism of the past michael hudson it s a higher stage of imperialism the old imperialism was colonialism you would come in and use military power to install a client ruling class but each country would have its own currency what has made imperialism super is that america doesn t have to colonize another country it doesn t have to invade a country or actually go to war with it all it needs is to have the country invest its savings its export earnings in loans to the united states government this enables the united states to keep its interest rates low and enable american investors to borrow from american banks at a low rate to buy up foreign industry and agriculture that s yielding 10 percent 15 percent or more so american investors realize that despite the balance of payments deficit they can borrow back these dollars at such a low rate from foreign countries paying only 1 percent to 3 percent on the treasury bonds they hold while pumping dollars into foreign economies by buying up their industry and agriculture and infrastructure and public utilities making large capital gains the hope is that and soon we ll earn our way out of debt by this free ride arrangement imperialism is getting something for nothing it is a strategy to obtain other countries surplus without playing a productive role but by creating an extractive rentiersystem an imperialist power obliges other countries to pay tribute of course america doesn t come right out and tell other countries you have to pay us tribute like roman emperors told the provinces they governed u s diplomats simply insist that other countries invest their balance of payments inflows and official central bank savings in us dollars especially u s treasury ious this treasury bill standard turns the global monetary and financial system into a tributary system that is what pays the costs of u s military spending including its 800 military bases throughout the world and its foreign legion of isis al qaeda fighters and color revolutions to destabilize countries that don t adhere to the dollar centered global economic system bonnie faulkner you write today it would be necessary for europe and asia to design an artificial politically created alternative to the dollar as an international store of value this promises to become the crux of international political tensions for the next generation how does the world break out of this double standard dollar domination michael hudson it s already coming about and trump is a great catalyst speeding departing guests china and russia are reducing their dollar holdings they don t want to hold american treasury bonds because if america goes to war with them it will do to them what it did to iran it will just keep all the money not pay back the investment china has kept in u s banks and the treasury so they re getting rid of the dollars that they hold they re buying gold and are moving as quickly as they can to be independent of any reliance on u s exports they are building up their military so that if the united states tries to threaten them they can defend themselves the world is fracturing bonnie faulkner what are foreign countries like china and russia using to buy gold are they buying it with dollars michael hudson yes they earn dollars or euros from what they re exporting this money goes into the central bank of china because chinese exporters want domestic yuan to pay their own workers and suppliers so they go to the bank of china and they exchange their dollars for yuan the bank of china the central bank then decides what to do with this foreign currency they may go into the open market and buy gold or they may spend it in foreign countries on the belt and road initiative to build a railway and steamship infrastructure and port development to help china s exporters integrate their economy with others and ultimately with europe replacing the united states as customer and supplier they see the united states as a dying economy bonnie faulkner can the chinese build up their belt and road infrastructure projects with dollars michael hudson no they are getting rid of dollars they already are receiving such a large surplus each year that they only use the dollars to buy gold or some goods such as boeing airplanes but mostly food and raw materials when china buys iron from australia for instance they sell dollars from their foreign exchange reserves and buy australian currency to pay australians for the iron ore that they import they use dollars to pay other countries that are still part of the dollar area and still willing to keep adding these dollars to their official monetary reserves instead of holding gold bonnie faulkner well it is kind of surprising michael that countries haven t started doing this a lot sooner michael hudson there has been political pressure not to withdraw from the dollar debt system if countries act independently they risk being overthrown it takes a strong government to resist american interference and dirty tricks to put its own country first instead of following the u s advisors and agents who pay them to serve the u s economy rather than their own or to resist brainwashing by university of chicago s junk economics bonnie faulkner how far along is the dollar s demise as the world s reserve currency michael hudson it s already slowing trump is doing everything he can to accelerate it by threatening that if foreign countries continue to recycle their export earnings into dollars raising the dollar s exchange rate we ll accuse them of manipulating their currency so he would like to end it all by the end of his second term in 2024 bonnie faulkner what would the united states look like if the dollar is no longer the world s reserve currency michael hudson if it continues to let wall street do the economic planning the economy will look like that of argentina bonnie faulkner and what does argentina look like michael hudson a narrow oligarchy at the top keeping labor at the bottom taking away labor s rights to unionize an economy whose financial and military sectors have won the class war bonnie faulkner china with its belt and road infrastructure project is now buying gold on the open market as are a number of other countries has the western banking system penetrated china and if so how would you characterize china s banking system michael hudson there s an attempt by the united states to penetrate china in the recent trade agreements china did permit u s banks to create their own credit i m not sure that this is going to really take off now that trump is accelerating the trade war but basically in america you have private banks extending credit to corporations in china you have the government banks extending the loans that saves china from having a financial crisis in the way that the united states does about 12 percent of american companies are said to be zombie companies they re already insolvent not able to make a profit after paying their heavy debt service but banks are still giving them enough credit to stay in business so they won t have to go bankrupt and create a crisis china doesn t have that problem because when chinese industry and factories are not able to pay the public bank of china can simply forgive the debt its choice is clear either it can let companies go bankrupt and be sold at a low price to some buyer mainly an american or it can wipe the bad debts off the books if china had been crazy enough to have student loans and leave its graduates impoverished instead of providing free universities china s central bank could simply write off the student loans no investors would lose because the banks are owned by the government its position is if you re a factory we don t want you to have to close down and unemploy your labor we ll just write down the debt and if your employees are having a really hard time we ll just write down their debts so that they can spend their money on goods and services to help expand our internal market america s banks are owned by the stockholders and bondholders who would never let chase manhattan or citibank or wells fargo just forgive their various categories of loans that s why public banking is so much more efficient from an economy wide level than private banks it s why banking should be a public utility not privatized bonnie faulkner can you explain further how writing down debts is good for the economy michael hudson well think of the alternative to writing down debts if you don t write down america s student debts the graduates are going to have to pay so much of the student debt service now to the government that they re not going to have enough money to be able to buy a house they won t have enough money to get married they won t have enough money to buy goods and services it means that most people who can buy houses are graduates with trust funds students whose parents are rich enough that they didn t have to take out a student loan to pay for their children s education these hereditary families are rich enough to buy them their own apartment that s why the american economy is polarizing between people who inherit enough money to be able to have their own housing and budgets free of student loans and other debts compared to families that are debt strapped and running deeper into debt and without much savings this financial bifurcation is making us poorer yet neoliberal economic theory sees this as a competitive advantage for them and for employers poverty is not a problem to be solved it is the solution to their own aim of profitability bonnie faulkner so is this whole privatization scheme particularly the privatization of the banking system and privatizing a lot of infrastructure what s bankrupting the united states michael hudson yes just as it s bankrupted england and other countries that followed thatcherism or the neo liberal philosophy since about 1980 bonnie faulkner michael hudson thank you again michael hudson it s always a pleasure to have these discussions bonnie faulkner i ve been speaking with dr michael hudson

of nav at the time of borrowing investment policy for the redemption pool at each redemption point the company may a notionally allocate assets and liabilities into a separate pool the redemption pool for the purpose of funding valid redemption requests for that redemption point or b fund the valid redemption requests from available cash with regard to the redemption pool the company aims to liquidate the necessary assets to meet qualifying redemption requests in a timely manner and to minimise the impact that such redemptions will have to existing shareholders and the company as a whole the management and impact of the risks associated with the investment policies are described in detail in the notes to the financial statements see note 16 investment manager and investment adviser quaero capital llp has been appointed as investment manager of the company since 1 august 2014 atlantis investment research corporation airc has been appointed as the investment adviser to the company since 1 august 2014 airc established in tokyo will through taeko setaishi as lead adviser and her colleagues advise the investment manager on the day to day conduct of the company s investment business the role it has played since the launch of the company in may 1996 chairman s statement for the financial year ended 30 april 2019 in contrast to the prior financial year the year ended 30 april 2019 proved to be a more challenging environment for the company as well as for most major developed equity markets despite these more turbulent times i am proud to report that over the course of the year the company s nav per share fell only marginally by 0 1 compared to a decrease of 2 9 for the topix total return index in gbp at the time of writing we have just passed the third anniversary of taeko setaishi s appointment as lead adviser in may 2016 over the three years to 30 april 2019 the company s nav per share has significantly outpaced the topix benchmark by 22 0 giving shareholders a total return of 64 0 in gbp terms it should be noted that this outperformance is after deduction of all costs and also takes into account a dilution impact of approximately 11 0 resulting from the new shares which were issued in october 2016 and october 2017 it is also worth highlighting that the company s three year nav per share performance record places the fund within the top three amongst the combined aic japan universe of ten investment trusts this strong performance reinforces my view that the company has longer term viability and that it is well positioned to warrant the closer attention of a broader investor base in this context i would like to draw your attention to the forthcoming continuation vote to be held at the agm on 12 september 2019 at which the board will be recommending that the company should continue in existence in order to carry on pursuing the investment mandate which has brought long term outperformance for shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting held in april 2016 the board with the support of shareholders laid out a plan to grow the company s assets under management aum primarily through improved performance and the subscription right programme over the three year period aum rose from 59 5m at 30 april 2016 to 107 3m as at 30 april 2019 although a significant achievement the board after much deliberation will be putting forward proposals to shareholders to amend the structure of the company in order to further enhance the sustainability and future success of the company for the benefit of shareholders i have already noted above the good performance that our investment advisor has produced since taeko setaishi took prime responsibility as portfolio manager the japanese stock market and economy remain among the largest in the world and the board is convinced that the company s investment mandate remains as relevant today as it was when the company first launched as well as performance in considering the company s future following the continuation vote the board has also considered all aspects of the company s structure it is evident to the board that while the redemption mechanism has provided shareholders with a valuable alternative to secondary market liquidity the mechanism is relatively complex and it is not always easy for all shareholders to participate in particular retail investors owning the shares through retail platforms may face administrative challenges when choosing to participate in the redemption mechanism the board believes that the time is right to replace this mechanism there is now much greater consensus in the investment companies sector that the use of dividend payments utilising distributable capital reserves is an effective and low cost way to provide investors with additional liquidity the board also believes it is a fairer way to distribute capital to all shareholders the board is also very mindful of the investment strategy and the impact that frequent and relatively large redemptions can have on a portfolio that is predominantly composed of small and mid sized companies a smaller and more frequent dividend payment will we believe interfere much less in how the portfolio is constructed finally the board notes that income investors who form a growing and important component of the overall investor universe are increasingly comfortable with dividends that are in part funded from capital reserves as one part of a portfolio of income producing investments there are limited options to receive meaningful levels of income and simultaneously gain exposure to the exciting growth potential of japanese equities so in introducing a dividend policy the board believes it will broaden the appeal of the company to a new range of investors with this in mind the board proposes to replace the redemption mechanism with a regular quarterly dividend payment set with reference to 1 of net asset value to be calculated on the basis of the daily average nav over the final month of each financial year dividends will be paid in march june september and december this will require a change to the company s articles of association which shareholders will be asked to vote upon at the agm the new dividend policy will be subject to shareholder approval at each agm in line with market practice it is our current intention that subject to the passing of these resolutions that the first dividend paid under this new policy will be paid in december 2019 the average net asset value for the final month of the financial year just passed was 237 pence per share and therefore the dividends for december march and june will be 2 37 pence per share based on the closing share price on 11 july 2019 this equates to an annualised dividend yield of 4 3 accordingly september s redemption will be the last opportunity that shareholders will have to redeem shares using the existing redemption mechanism the board has also reviewed the current 90 day rolling discount mechanism currently the company is obligated to propose a continuation vote to shareholders should the discount on any given 90 day rolling period average greater than ten per cent it has concluded that while this mechanism has assisted in limiting the average discount it has also had the effect of acting as a natural brake on the discount narrowing more substantially since the company introduced this mechanism in 2013 market practice among investment companies has moved to a more flexible approach to discount control that also takes into account factors such as liquidity and prevailing market conditions and the board believes that taking such an approach is in the interests of all shareholders the board wishes to emphasise to shareholders that it remains committed to managing the discount using share buy backs but feels that this commitment is better served by taking a less formulaic approach the board emphasises that it believes that it is in the long term interests of shareholders that the company grows its share capital and this can only be achieved if the share price trades consistently at or above net asset value the board will be renewing its existing powers to buy back shares at the agm alongside these changes the board also proposes that in addition to the forthcoming continuation vote there will be a similar opportunity at every fourth agm to vote on the continuation of the company beginning in at the agm in 2023 finally and again in line with market best practice the board has agreed with the investment manager a change to the investment management fees a tiered fee structure has been agreed with a fee of 1 per cent on the first 125m of net assets 0 85 on net assets between 125m and 175m and 0 70 on net assets above 175m overall your board believes this package of measures is in line with today s market best practice better aligns the interests of all shareholders and makes your company a more attractive proposition to a wider potential audience performance over the financial year the company s nav per share fell by 0 1 this compares to the benchmark topix s 2 9 decrease on a

currently operates a hard discount control mechanism whereby the company is obliged to hold a continuation vote should the shares have traded on average at a discount of more than 10 to the nav per share during any rolling 90 day period in normal market conditions if the obligation to hold a continuation vote is triggered the vote will be held no later than the next practicable annual general meeting of the company share buy backs in order to assist in managing the discount at which the company s shares trade and to enhance the nav per share of remaining shareholders the company has authority to buy back shares during the financial year ended 30 april 2019 the company exercised its authority to buy back shares on three separate occasions in respect of a total of 500 000 ordinary shares at a weighted average discount of 8 7 based on diluted navs since the financial year end the company has not exercised its authority to buy back any further shares the shares bought back during the financial year representing 1 1 of current issued shares are held in treasury redemption facility at the redemption point on 28 september 2018 2 874 315 shares representing 5 9 of issued shares were validly lodged for redemption under the terms of the redemption facility total redemptions at each redemption point are limited to 5 of the issued share capital excluding treasury shares at that time accordingly redemption requests were scaled back so that only 5 0 of the company s shares 2 434 356 shares were accepted for redemption and redeemed at this redemption point at the redemption point on 29 march 2019 3 811 426 shares representing 8 27 of issued shares were validly lodged for redemption redemption requests were scaled back so that only 5 0 of the company s shares 2 303 888 shares were accepted for redemption as part of the operation of the redemption facility on 29 march 2019 a matched trade mechanism was utilised to match any and all redemptions received with 533 400 shares being matched from redemptions in excess of shareholders basic entitlements gearing gearing is defined as the ratio of a company s long term debt less cash held compared to its equity capital expressed as a percentage the effect of gearing is that in rising markets the company tends to benefit from any growth of the company s investment portfolio above the cost of payment of the prior ranking entitlements of any lenders and other creditors conversely in falling markets the company suffers more if the company s investment portfolio underperforms the cost of those prior entitlements in order to improve the potential for capital returns to shareholders the company currently has access to a flexible loan facility with the royal bank of scotland international limited for amounts up to 1 5 billion as at the end of april 2019 the company s net gearing level being the amount of drawn down bank debt less the cash held on the balance sheet was 3 8 2018 2 4 the directors consider it a priority that the company s level of gearing should be maintained at appropriate levels with sufficient flexibility to enable the company to adapt at short notice to changes in market conditions the board reviews the company s level of gearing on a regular basis the current maximum that has been set is 20 of the company s total assets the investment adviser will be encouraged to use the gearing facility and the company s cash reserves in order to enhance returns for shareholders priips key information documents we are required by eu regulations introduced at the beginning of 2018 to provide investors with a key information document kid which includes performance projections which are the product of prescribed calculations based on the company s past performance whilst the content and format of the kid cannot be amended under the applicable eu regulations the board sharing industry wide concerns does not believe that these projections are an appropriate or helpful way to assess the company s future prospects accordingly the board urges shareholders also to consider the more complete information set out in the company s interim and full annual report and financial statements together with the monthly factsheets and daily net asset value announcements when considering an investment in the company s shares these documents together with a link to third party research coverage of the company are published at www atlantisjapangrowthfund com ongoing charges the board continues to look very closely at the level of ongoing charges incurred by the company and for the financial year ended 30 april 2019 the ongoing charges were 1 6 30 april 2018 1 6 the board will remain vigilant in seeking opportunities for further reductions outlook while japan s economic annual growth is likely to be subdued beneath this placid outlook there are profound economic and social structural changes fostering compelling investment opportunities we expect the bank of japan boj to maintain its current loose monetary policies with the 2 0 inflation target still a long way off although the deflationary risks seem to all but have disappeared given the ever increasing labour shortages and improving private sector capex in previous statements i have highlighted the implications for the company of the greater focus in japan on the corporate governance code and we continue to see a steady improvement in total shareholder returns by way of more efficient use of capital share buybacks and higher dividends as at the end of april 2019 the topix was trading on a forward price earnings multiple of 13x and a price to book ratio of 1 30x these valuations are towards the lower end of historical ranges and compare favourably to other developed equity markets taeko setaishi the company s investment adviser expects the growth outlook for mid to smaller sized companies to continue to exceed that for larger companies lending support to the company s portfolio positioning in conclusion i believe there is a compelling case for investment in japanese equities over the medium to longer term furthermore the company s adviser is very well placed to pursue long term capital gains through bottom up stock picking to select undervalued companies with a strong competitive advantage and longer term growth potential noel lamb12 july 2019 investment adviser s report for the financial year ended 30 april 2019 performance the company s nav per share calculated in gbp and on a total return basis ended the financial year at 242 15p representing a 0 1 loss during the course of the year the company s share price at the financial year end was 218 50p a decrease of 0 2 over the same period and representing a 9 8 discount to nav over the financial year the topix total return index recorded a 2 9 capital loss calculated in gbp at the conclusion of the financial year under review the company s borrowings stood at 1 billion with cash of 297 million the company s net gearing was 3 8 which compared to a gearing of 2 4 at the end of the previous year jpy was 144 24 against gbp at 30 april 2019 a gain of 4 2 from the previous financial year s closing rate of 150 27 the company s portfolio at 30 april 2019 contained 62 companies one more than at the same time a year ago the companies which made a particularly strong contribution to the portfolio s performance during the financial year included semiconductor production equipment maker lasertec corporate benefits administrator benefit one material handling logistics systems equipment assembler daifuku and medical equipment assembler asahi intecc excluding cash the portfolio was entirely invested in the equities of publicly listed japanese companies and listed j reits the company had no foreign exchange hedges and no exposure to convertible bonds or any other type of structured financial product market comment economic outlook the financial year ended 30 april 2019 was challenging for japanese equity investors investor sentiment was negatively affected by geopolitical tensions in asia trade disputes and a sluggish chinese economy the tokyo stock exchange short sell ratio hovered in the 45 50 range for prolonged periods of time a data point suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for japan equities the october december quarter was particularly punishing as indices for large and smaller capitalised stocks declined by 15 25 in local currency terms reassured by better economic data from china and reported progress in trade negotiations the tokyo stock price index topix rebounded in the final quarter of the company s financial year despite this during the financial year on a total return basis topix dropped by 6 8 in jpy 2 9 in gbp terms the investment adviser expects corporate earnings in the coming financial year to be at best flat year on year with particular weakness in the initial six months sluggish sales growth could negatively impact operating rates other profit headwinds include higher input labour costs owing to a the tight labour market and b personnel reforms intended to equalise compensation between full time and part time employees japan reported a surprising 2 1 annualised growth spurt for january march 2019 however this performance masked underlying weaknesses since the economy s principal components consumption private sector capex and exports declined owing to fiscal stimulus and anticipatory spending related to the forthcoming sales tax increase japan should remain on a growth path in the first two quarters of fiscal year march 2020 and then decline in the subsequent quarter real gdp growth in fiscal year march 2020 could be below its potential and in the 0 3 to 0 5 range inflation is set to remain well below the bank of japan s 2 target for the foreseeable future consequently monetary policy will remain exceptionally loose with a rate hike not likely to be considered for another 12 months in summary the investment adviser expects the japanese economy over the medium term to generate annualised growth of approximately 0 5 to 1 0 supported by contributions from private sector capital expenditure external demand and household consumption the risks associated with this scenario include a lengthy comprehensive trade war between china and the united states combined both account for 40 of japan s exports tariffs and or other hostile measures taken by the united states specifically against the japanese automobile sector a sudden jpy appreciation against the usd and increases in commodity prices investment adviser s strategy the investment adviser employs a bottom up stock picking investment style which is based on the assumption that anticipated corporate profits growth is a key determinant of equity valuations over the long term consequently the investment advisory team at airc seeks out companies with strong competitive advantages positive cash flows and secular growth potential while airc s proprietary research is a team effort investment decisions are the sole responsibility of the lead investment adviser the airc investment process may but will not necessarily result in a portfolio bias tilted toward medium and smaller capitalised companies there are no top down pre determined sector weightings as such sector exposure is created by the accumulation of individual positions held in the topix sector the portfolio is constructed to gain exposure to themes expected to drive japan s economic growth over the long term while japan s economic annual growth will likely oscillate around a 0 5 1 0 trend line beneath this placid outlook there are profound economic and social structural changes fostering compelling investment opportunities in particular 1 japan s irreversible demographic trend will intensify demand for geriatric healthcare products and services other societies will have to find solutions to rising healthcare demands and arguably japan will lead in developing new hard and software solutions the company s exposure to geriatric healthcare is focused on care suppliers solasto equipment makers asahi intecc and cutting edge drug discovery firms peptidream 2 japan s tight labour market has prompted companies to re evaluate their personnel practices every effort is being made to retain personnel through improved conditions and offering full

and fullcast 3 japan is the largest supplier of robots material handling systems and other capital goods to asia the company s investments in this sector include daifuku and mitsubishi electric 4 the investment adviser believes semiconductors are a secular growth product with sustained long term demand from the automobile sector content digitalisation and the internet of things japanese companies have carved out high market shares in critical semiconductor production equipment production line tools investments include lasertec tokyo electron disco and japan material 5 the structural changes occurring in the japanese economy have created a hospitable environment for new business ventures as a growth oriented investment vehicle the company constantly seeks new businesses for investment new business model investments include bengo4 com house do bplats s pool and tkp the investment advisory team at airc consists of four analysts advisers who are engaged daily in contacting companies or preparing for management visits the team meets formally on a weekly basis to review the previous week s visits but it also exchanges information on a daily basis airc has a collegiate approach to research but believes a sole individual should be responsible for portfolio advisory decisions the lead investment adviser to the company taeko setaishi is responsible for the final stock recommendations but relies on input from the other team members in conclusion the investment adviser believes the japanese equity markets are host to many attractive growth investment opportunities that have the potential to contribute to the company s long term capital appreciation atlantis investment research corporation 12 july 2019 alternative investment fund manager s report for the

monitored as appropriate discount a disproportionate widening of the discount relative to the company s peers could result in loss of value for shareholders the board reviews the discount level regularly the introduction of the redemption facility has improved the liquidity in the company s shares and helps to narrow the discount to the nav at which the shares trade the company operates a shareholder approved discount control mechanism whereby the company will hold a continuation vote if the shares have traded on average at a discount of more than 10 to the nav per share during any rolling 90 day period in normal market conditions if the obligation to hold a continuation vote is triggered the vote will be held no later than the next practicable annual general meeting of the company regulatory the company operates in a complex regulatory environment and faces a number of regulatory risks breaches of regulations such as section 1158 of the corporation tax act 2010 the companies guernsey law 2008 the ukla listing rules and the dtr could lead to a number of detrimental outcomes and reputational damage the company conforms with the alternative investment fund managers

the companies guernsey law 2008 the poi law the ukla listing rules and prospectus rules the dtr and the rules of the london stock exchange operational like most other investment trust companies the

investments are disclosed in note 16 to the financial statements the financial risks disclosed in note 16 are detailed for compliance with ifrs corporate governance and shareholder relations details of the company s compliance with corporate governance best practice including information on relations with shareholders are set out in the corporate governance statement below and this statement forms part of the directors report viability statement in accordance with provision c 2 2 of the uk corporate governance code as issued by the financial reporting council frc in april 2016 the board has assessed the prospects of the company over the next three years including the period from the date of this document to the annual general meeting in 2019 the company s investment objective is to achieve long term capital growth and the board regards the company as a long term investment the board has considered the company s business model including its investment objective and investment policy as well as the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the company as detailed below the board in its assessment of the viability of the company has considered each of the company s principal risks as referred to above in particular the impact of a significant fall in the japanese equity market on the value of the company s investment portfolio the board has noted that the company holds a highly liquid portfolio invested predominantly in listed equities and no significant increase to ongoing charges or operational expenses is anticipated the directors also review the level of the discount or premium between the middle market price of the company s ordinary shares and their nav on a regular basis the directors have powers granted to them at the last annual general meeting to purchase ordinary shares and either cancel or hold them in treasury as a method of controlling the discount to nav and enhancing shareholder value the board has therefore concluded based on the company s processes for monitoring operating costs share price discount the investment manager s compliance with the investment objective asset allocation the portfolio risk profile gearing counterparty exposure liquidity risk and financial controls that there is a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years as part of its assessment the board has noted that shareholders will be required to vote on the continuation of the company at the 2019 annual general meeting going concern as outlined in the viability statement above the directors believe that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the next 12 months whilst the company is obliged to hold a continuation vote at the 2019 annual general meeting in accordance with its discount control mechanism the directors do not believe this should automatically trigger the adoption of a basis other than going concern basis in line with the association of investment companies aic statement of recommended practice sorp which states that it is more appropriate to prepare financial statements on a going concern basis unless a continuation vote has already been triggered and shareholders have voted against continuation the directors have also taken account its expectations of the results of the forthcoming continuation vote while the outcome of the vote is not yet known and therefore creates some uncertainty as to the going concern basis the directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of the continuation resolution and have no reason to assume that shareholders will not support the continuation of the company and have prepared the viability statement under this assumption save as noted above in the company s viability statement there are no material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt as to the ability of the company to continue to meet its ongoing obligations alternative investment fund managers directive the company has entered into the arrangements necessary to ensure compliance with the aifm directive

provisions of the uk code throughout the financial year except as set out below the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration the need for an internal audit function the need to appoint a senior independent director the need to appoint a nomination committee or management engagement committee the whistle blowing policy for the reasons set out in the aic guide and as explained in the uk code the board considers these provisions are not relevant to the position of the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the directors are non executive and the company does not have employees hence no whistle blowing policy is required however the directors note that the company s service providers have whistle blowing policies in place the board disclosures under principle 5 of the aic code the board comprises four independent non executive directors including the chairman noel lamb due to the size of the company the nature of its activities and the fact that all of the directors are independent the board does not consider it necessary to appoint a senior independent director the board has not appointed a remuneration committee but comprising wholly independent directors the whole board considers these matters regularly the board considers agenda items formally laid out in the notice and agenda which are formally circulated to the board in advance of the meeting as part of the board papers the primary focus at board meetings is a review of investment performance and associated matters such as the discount redemptions gearing asset allocation marketing and investor relations peer group information and industry issues there were four board meetings 1 may 2017 30 april 2018 five and three audit committee meetings 1 may 2017 30 april 2018 three held during the financial year 1 may 2018 to 30 april 2019 the table below shows the number of formal meetings attended by each director during the financial year director board meetings attended audit committee meetings attended noel lamb 4 3 philip ehrmann 4 3 richard pavry 4 3 michael moule 4 3 in addition to the above meetings there were also five other committee meetings 1 may 2017 30 april 2018 five held during the financial year in relation to the operation of the redemption facility and other operational matters directors are appointed initially until the following annual general meeting when under the company s articles of incorporation it is required that they be re elected by shareholders thereafter two directors shall retire by rotation or if only one director is subject to retire by rotation he shall retire the retiring directors will then be eligible for reappointment having been considered for reappointment by the chairman and other directors the board is recommending that all directors be subject to re election at the forthcoming agm the board evaluates its performance and considers the tenure of each director on an annual basis and considers that the mix of skills experience ages and length of service to be appropriate to the requirements of the company when considering succession planning the board bears in mind the balance of skills knowledge and experience and diversity existing on the board the board has noted amendments to the uk code to strengthen the principle on boardroom diversity following the davies report the board considers diversity as part of the annual performance evaluation and it is felt that there is a range of backgrounds and each director brings different qualities to the board and its discussions it is not felt appropriate for the company to have set targets in relation to diversity candidates will be assessed in relation to the relevant needs of the company at the time of appointment a good knowledge of investment management generally japanese investment management specifically and investment trust industry matters and sophisticated investor concerns relevant to the company will nevertheless remain the key criteria by which new board candidates will be assessed the board will recommend when the recruitment of additional non executive directors is required once a decision is made to recruit additional directors to the board each director is invited to submit nominations and these are considered in accordance with the board s agreed procedures the board may also use independent external agencies as and when the requirement to recruit an additional board member becomes necessary the board embraces the principles of the uk code but with regard to its provisions concerning director tenure is of the opinion that an individual s independence cannot be arbitrarily determined on the basis of a set period of time the company s investment objective is to achieve long term capital growth and it benefits from having long serving directors with a detailed knowledge of the company s operations to effectively oversee its management on behalf of shareholders the company therefore does not impose fixed term limits on directors tenure as this would result in a loss of experience and knowledge without any assurance of increased independence the board collectively and individually firmly believes in the continued independence of its members the board confirms that the performance of all directors has been subject to formal evaluation and that they continue to be effective in their role the board firmly recommends to shareholders that all directors should be re elected there is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional advice if necessary and at the company s expense this is in addition to the access which every director has to the advice of the company secretary the company has taken out insurance jointly with qbe and travelers in respect of the directors liability for the financial year ended 30 april 2019 the charge was 4 875 internal controls the board has delegated the responsibility for the management of the company s investment portfolio the provision of depositary services and the administration registrar and corporate secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the company s nav and the production of the annual report and audited financial statements the annual report and audited financial statements are also independently audited whilst the board delegates responsibility it retains responsibility for the functions it delegates and is responsible for the risk management and systems of internal control formal contractual agreements have been put in place between the company and providers of these services the board directly on an ongoing basis and via its audit committee has implemented a system to identify and manage the risks inherent in such contractual arrangements by assessing and evaluating the performance of the service providers including financial operational and compliance controls and risk management systems on an ongoing basis compliance reports are provided at each board meeting from the administrator northern trust international fund administration services guernsey limited and the audit committee reviews the service organisation controls soc 1 report on this service provider the extent and quality of the systems of internal control and compliance adopted by the investment manager and the investment adviser are also reviewed on a regular basis and the primary focus at each board meeting is a review of investment performance and associated matters such as gearing asset allocations marketing and investment relations peer group information and industry issues the board also closely monitors the level of discount and has the ability to buy back shares in the market the board believes that it has implemented an effective system for the assessment of risk but the company has no staff has no internal audit function and can only give reasonable but not absolute assurance that there has been no material financial misstatement or loss committees the board has established an audit committee which is described below the

secretary is the secretary of the audit committee and attends all meetings of the audit committee the audit committee is satisfied that auditor objectivity and independence is not impaired by the performance by pwc ci llp of non audit services which cover uk tax compliance services the audit committee considers that the appointment of a third party unfamiliar with the company to carry out non audit services of uk tax compliance would not benefit shareholders since they would incur unnecessary additional expense the audit committee is authorised by the board to investigate any activity

audit process the committee has devoted time to ensuring that controls and processes have been properly established documented and implemented during the course of the financial year the information that the audit committee has received has been timely and clear and has enabled the audit committee to discharge its duties effectively the audit committee supports the aims of the uk code and the best practice recommendations of other corporate governance organisations and the association of investment companies aic and believes that reporting against the revised aic code allows the audit committee to further strengthen its role as a key independent oversight committee role and responsibilities the primary function of the audit committee is to assist the board in fulfilling its

committee through reports received from the investment manager investment adviser and depositary along with those from the administrator and external auditor the audit committee has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and has decided that the systems and procedures employed by the investment manager investment adviser administrator and depositary provide sufficient assurance that a sound system of risk management and internal control which safeguards shareholders investments and the company s assets is maintained an internal audit function is therefore considered unnecessary

financial issues the audit committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted the audit committee reviews accounting papers prepared by the investment manager and administrator

investments the company s investments had a fair value of 111 379 895 as at 30 april 2019 and represent a substantial portion of the assets of the company as such this is the largest factor in relation to the consideration of the financial statements these investments are valued in accordance with the significant accounting policies set out in note 2 f to the financial statements the audit committee considered the valuation of the investments held by the company as at 30 april 2019 to be correct from information provided by the investment manager investment adviser depositary and administrator on their processes for the valuation of these investments ii income recognition the audit committee considered the income from investments recorded in the financial statements for the

committee meeting to review the annual report and audited financial statements the audit committee received and reviewed a report on the audit from the external auditors on the basis of its review of this report the audit committee is satisfied that the external auditor has fulfilled its responsibilities with diligence and professional scepticism the audit committee advised the board that these annual report and audited financial statements taken as a whole are fair balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company s performance business model and strategy v going concern whilst the company is obliged to hold a continuation vote at the 2019 annual general meeting the directors do not believe this should automatically trigger the adoption of a basis other than going concern while the outcome of the vote is unknown and therefore creates some uncertainty on the validity of the going concern basis the directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of the continuation resolution and have no reason to presume that shareholders will not support the continuation of the company and have prepared the viability statement under this assumption the audit committee is satisfied that appropriate disclosures have been included in the financial statements external auditor the audit committee has responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment reappointment and removal of the external auditor pwc ci llp has been external auditor to the company since their appointment on 13 january 2015 during the financial year the audit committee received and reviewed audit plans and reports from the external auditor to assess the effectiveness of the external audit process the auditors were asked to articulate the steps that they have taken to ensure objectivity and independence including where the auditor provides non audit services the audit committee also reviewed the work done during the financial year by the external auditors both as part of the audit process and on non audit matters and from time to time compares their effectiveness as well as their costs with the benefit of the experience they have had in other investment management houses and relevant contexts these steps enable the audit committee to monitor the auditor s performance behaviour and effectiveness during the exercise of their duties which informs the decision to recommend reappointment on an annual basis the audit committee under its terms of reference reviews the appointment and re appointment of the external auditor typically at its december meeting in advance of the reviewing the audit approach for the annual report and audited financial statements the external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner every five years and the current partner has been in place for five year end audits therefore a new audit partner will be in place for the year ended 30 april 2020 the audit committee has adopted a policy on the engagement of the company s auditor to supply non audit services to the company pwc ci llp was paid 7 250 for non audit services during the financial year under review 30 april 2018 5 250 the committee ensures that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded by requiring pre approval by the committee for all non audit services provided to the company which takes into consideration confirmation from the auditor that they have adequate arrangements in place to safeguard their objectivity and independence in carrying out such work within the meaning of the regulatory and professional requirements to which they are subject the fees to be incurred relative to the audit fees the nature of the non audit services and whether the auditor s skills and experience make it the most suitable supplier of such services and whether they are in a position to provide them the committee has reviewed the non audit services performed by pwc ci llp in the financial year and has concluded that the policy has been applied and their independence and objectivity has not been impaired as a result the following table summarises the remuneration paid for

london reuters 1 happy birthday bretton woods in july 1944 as world war two raged finance chiefs from the world s main trading nations met in bretton woods new hampshire that agreement signed july 22 was one of the first global monetary policy and currency agreements re establishing a gold standard for exchange rates backing away from competitive devaluations and setting up the international monetary fund to bridge balance of payments gaps but as the bretton woods pact turns 75 that spirit of cooperation whether on exchange rates or trade is waning trade protectionism is on the rise

foreign exchange rate dilemma in nigeria a standout dilemma in international trade is the exchange rate puzzle amongst countries this issue is of importance because exchange rate movements have severe effects on economic performance and humans as seen in the past southeast asia between 1997 1998 russia and brazil between 1998 1999 baumol blinder 2010 p 746 the problematic issue with international trade as compared to that of domestic trade is that there are national boundaries to cross for trade to occur for instance mercedes benz is shipped to nigeria from germany the consumer in nigeria pays in naira and the exporting company expects to receive the payment in euros in a similar scenario if a farmer in the united states of america ships his groundnut or cocoa to germany the customers in germany will only have euros as a means of payment rather than the dollars the farmer will originally want these movements along national borders are the reason for developing an exchange rate system baumol blinder 2010 p 746 therefore for international trade to occur a mechanism needs to be in place for efficient conversion of national currencies an exchange rate indicates the amount in terms of a domestic currency at which a foreign currency can be acquired baumol blinder 2010 p 746 for instance one dollar exchanges for 304 9 naira this means that the cost of getting one dollar in the nigerian currency is 304 9 this also means that it will cost 0 003049 to buy 1 naira under the current world economic system currency rates are constantly changing in terms of appreciation or depreciation appreciation occurs when a country s currency unit has the ability to buy more units of a foreign currency whereas depreciation occurs when a country s domestic currency can buy lesser units of a foreign currency baumol blinder 2010 p 747 the importance of converting one currency to another in international trade has been highlighted above the big question now becomes what will determine the rates at which different currencies would be exchanged for another this essay would answer the question by examining the different determinants of exchange rates and analyzing how these changes affect a country s economy most nations of the world today allow exchange rates to float with no interference from government or its agencies in this free system market flow or forces of demand and supply determine exchange rate for example the price at which goods and services provided by corporations small and medium scale businesses are sold is determined by them without government interference therefore forces of demand and supply in a free floating market determine exchange rate within the system as such at a rate that is below equilibrium the number of dollars demanded by the market would be more than the dollars in circulation this scarcity or limited availability of dollars will lead to a higher price bid for dollars appreciate in the opposite at a rate above equilibrium point where the quantity of dollars in the market would be more than the needed amount in the market the monetary value of dollars would reduce depreciate exchange rate remains the same at equilibrium baumol blinder 2010 p 746 assuming dollars and naira are the most used currency in the world and the market has a task of determining the exchange rate of one when the demand and supply are in equilibrium at a price of 304 9 per dollar which means the amount of dollar demanded is equivalent to the supply hence the price of naira to dollar becomes 304 9 per dollar from the example given above it will be observed that a lot was said about demand and supply without any reference to why someone in nigeria germany or france would demand or need dollars when they do not live or come from the united states of america thus the demand for dollars is as a result of the following reasons buying stocks and bonds from international markets for instance if a nigerian investor wishes to purchase a united states stocks or bonds such investor will first acquire the dollars that traders in the u s will insist on as a means of payment therefore as the rate of demand for u s a assets increases the demand for dollars increases too this ultimately increases the exchange rate of dollar to the naira baumol blinder 2010 p 748 purchase of machineries and factories overseas by domestic investors when domestic investors try to expand their base overseas by buying machineries and sometimes factories this increases the demand for the foreign currency this means that the rate will be below the equilibrium level which signifies appreciation of the foreign currency baumol blinder 2010 p 748 another factor that would cause a shift in the demand for dollars is international trade in goods and services the rate at which a country s exports are needed and bought at the international market also determines the rate at which its currency would be needed by investors baumol blinder 2010 p 748 moving forward the rate at which a country imports foreign products seriously affects the amount of its domestic currency supply finally another factor that influences the amount of a country s currency in circulation is the rate of international investments or trades that its own domestic entrepreneurs embark on baumol blinder 2010 p 748 the major factors affecting the determination of exchange rate in a short term are interest rate differentials and capital flow amongst nations baumol blinder 2010 p 749 in macroeconomics short run is usually a term used for financial analysis or calculations that occur daily weekly or monthly in the short run the flow of currencies responds to the differences in interest rates in such a way that the rates of return are equal across borders hallagan 2010 interest rate differentials can be said to be the return on all financial assets invested by two countries over a period of time assuming there is an increase in domestic interest rate and also a constant move towards local currency assets the local currency in question will gain more value appreciation in contrast a decrease in local interest rate accompanied by a move towards foreign currency assets will cause the local currency in question lose its value depreciation baumol blinder 2010 p 749 for a foreign interest rate variable an increase or decrease in foreign currency assets will cause the local currency to depreciate or appreciate as the case maybe finally when there is a rise decrease in the estimated future spot exchange rate towards foreign local assets the domestic currency depreciates appreciates baumol blinder 2010 p 749 in the medium run determination of exchange rate is quite difficult because of the instability of the financial market there is this belief that consumer spending power goes higher when there is an increase in income and it reduces when there is also a fall in income same outcome is likely to influence exchange rates in the medium run there will be a significant increase in imports when a country s economy is strong and this amount of imports will also reduce when the economy is in stagnation or goes into recession baumol blinder 2010 p 750 for instance there was a boom in the economy of nigeria in 2011 due to the rise in the price of crude oil this economic prosperity shifted the demand ceiling for international currencies to move outwardly as most nigerians sort to buy more dollars in order to purchase foreign products this led to the appreciation of the dollar and depreciation of the naira from the illustration the booming of the dollar at that time would make americans buy more exports from nigeria this trade would cause the naira to shift outwardly in response to its supply curve thus in the medium run the differences between imports and exports determine exchange rates therefore in a country where its imports are higher than exports the demand curve for its currency would usually shift outward faster than the supply curve if other variables are equal in this scenario the country s currency would depreciate the opposite happens to a country s currency that the exports are higher than imports however a strong economy does not necessarily translate to a strong currency this is because most times other variables such as trade in stocks and bonds higher interest rates and trading of goods and services are not always equal finally it would be better to say that a strong continuous economic performance in all sense of it would in most cases guarantee an appreciation of a nation s currency because it drives investments baumol blinder 2010 p 750 in a long term exchange rate is determined by currency moving in response to the price difference so that prices for the same goods are the same even across borders hallagan 2010 in microeconomics exchange rates in the long term can be best described using the law of one price loop hallagan 2010 law of one price states that in a case where there is free trade and the cost of transporting the goods are low compared to the value of the products similar products that are sold worldwide should sell at the same price when expressed in a standard currency hallagan 2010 for instance if a 50 karat gold necklace sells for 1 000 000 in nigeria and 8000 in the u s at an exchange rate of 304 9 in this case traders might pay as high as 2 000 000 to buy this necklace in nigeria and still sell it for 7900 if this process continues the price of the necklace in nigeria will continue to increase while the price in the u s will continue to go down until the price becomes 2 286 750 in nigeria and 7500 in the united states of america purchasing power parity theory deals with the macroeconomic aspect of a wide range of goods purchasing power parity theory states that the exchange rates of any two national currencies change in such a way that it reflects the differences in the price level of the two countries baumol blinder 2010 p 751 relative purchasing power parity and absolute purchasing power parity are the main kinds of purchasing power parity hallagan 2010 some important implications of relative purchasing power parity theory are a relatively high inflation rate will occasion a depreciation of a country s domestic currency a relatively low inflation rate will occasion an appreciation of a country s local currency the level at which a country s currency appreciates or depreciates will be approximately equal to the percentage point in their inflation rate difference hallagan 2010 in absolute purchasing power parity any market basket of commodities will have the same price when expressed in a standard currency while relative purchasing power parity describes changes in exchange rate as a resultant effect of the differences in the level of prices between two countries hallagan 2010 big mac since after its invention in 1986 has been a renowned international brand that assesses how purchasing power parity theory influences exchange rate determination baumol blinder 2010 p 752 it is an economic magazine that tries to make exchange rate puzzle easy to understand generally exchange rate systems are categorized into three in the first system market forces of supply and demand determine exchange rates with no interference from government and its agencies in the second system some government indirect and sometimes direct actions influence exchange rate values in the third system government set exchange rate prices of their currencies through active support to the market and through policies that regulate the market in an exchange rate system that is fixed by the government the performance of the system is determined by the country s balance of payments which regulates demand and supply of a currency when a government s fixed exchange rate is monitored through the use of its balance of payments there is a possibility of having either a balance of payments surplus or balance of payments deficit baumol blinder 2010 p 753 a deficit in the balance of payments occur when the quantity supplied of a country s currency per year exceeds the quantity demanded whereas a surplus in the balance of payments occur when the quantity demanded of a country s currency per year exceeds the quantity supplied baumol blinder 2010 p 753 most fixed exchange rate mechanisms share some common important characteristics and they include commodity system in a commodity standard system countries attach the worth of their currencies to a particular valuable commodity university of minnesota 2016 this means that each currency is fixed relatively to another since the currency value is fixed in terms of a valuable commodity university of minnesota 2016 centuries ago the value of many currencies were fixed proportional to the value of gold baumol blinder 2010 p 755 for instance if the value of gold was fixed at 30 per ounce in the u s that means that anyone who provides 30 will be given 1 ounce of gold as exchange also assuming the nigerian naira and gold exchanges for 50 per ounce of gold therefore if 30 and 50 are traded for 1 ounce of gold 1 6 would exchange for 1 this means that nobody would pay more than 1 6 in exchange for 1 since 50 can always be exchanged for 3 5 ounce of gold the commodity standard system was self regulatory because the amount of money in a country was measured by the number of gold in that country in a commodity standard system a country can run into deficit if the supply of a domestic currency exceeds demand the country will have to sell part of its gold holdings to finance the deficit baumol blinder 2010 p 755 also when there is a reduction in the gold holdings of a country money supply reduces this will reduce the general demand and thereby lowering the price level and income in that country university of minnesota 2016 the bretton wood system the bretton wood system came on board due to the continuous imbalances in the balance of payments of countries these imbalances were to be rectified by changing the entire economic framework which made countries to start forgoing the commodity standard system in 1930 this period was very challenging as world trade was brought to a still due to world war ll as the war was coming to an end representatives of the united states and its allies met in 1944 at bretton woods new hampshire to develop a new mechanism through which international trade could be financed after the war baumol blinder 2010 p 755 the united states was vital in this arrangement because it had a large portion of the world foreign reserve as at that time baumol blinder 2010 p 755 the proposal was still on fixed exchange rate system though with less emphasis on valuable commodity such as gold the bretton wood accord gave room for each country s currency value to be fixed relative to that of other countries the strategy for sustaining these rates was the use of governments and central banks to play supervisory and interventionary roles in the currency market university of minnesota 2016 for example if the rate at which the dollar exchanges for the nigerian naira is fixed at 1 6 per 1 at an equilibrium rate as far as the fixed rate tallies with the equilibrium rate the fixed rate functions similarly as a free floating market rate the current practice the exchange rate system as at today is a combination of a free floating and fixed exchange rate pattern without an underlying guideline some countries such as china sill practice the bretton woods system a few others have adopted the united states dollar as its domestic currency ecuador and panama and some other countries tie their currencies to speculative values of other currencies while most allow exchange rates to float with some form of government inference baumol blinder 2010 p 762 the international monetary fund imf is an institution that is playing a leading role in the determination of exchange rates in this current financial system it was established in 1944 at bretton woods with a mandate of regularly examining the economies of its member countries and give advices were necessary the imf offer financial assistance to member nations when they run into serious financial crisis the imf most times offers these loans alongside weighty conditions which may further deepen the economic crisis of the country if not well managed baumol blinder 2010 p 762 other major factors that influence the current exchange rate system are the unstable nature of the dollar a rise or decline in the value of the dollar today affects world economy negatively or positively depending on the cause and its resultant effect this is because the dollar today is widely seen and to some extent is accepted as a means of payment in the international market also an increase in the exchange rate for dollar lowers exports and increases imports in america because people and industries would prefer to trade with countries with lesser currency value the growth of euro as championed by members of the european union eu conclusion exchange rate is an important tool in order to determine a country s relative economic growth and stability because of the vital role it plays in international trade and investments this essay examined the macroeconomic determinants of exchange rates across markets in the short medium and long term government s involvement and the current system that is practiced today the determinants of exchange rate in a free floating market were identified as the forces of demand and supply in a short run factors that determined exchange rates were interest rates its differentials and the capital flow amongst countries in the medium run the difference between imports and exports determined exchange rates movements in response to price difference for the same commodity across borders are a major determinant of exchange rate in a long term however there are cases where government fixes exchange rate values of their currencies through policies and regulation of the market as at today the exchange rate system is a mixture of a free floating and a fixed system without a prescribed guiding principle in the current system today organizations such as the international monetary fund imf give economic advices and sometimes offer palliatives to member countries going through economic crises finally other factors influencing foreign exchange rates are the volatile nature of the dollar and the progressive growth of the euro references baumo w j and blinder a s 2010 economics principle and

by reuters london reuters 1 happy birthday bretton woods in july 1944 as world war two raged finance chiefs from the world s main trading nations met in bretton woods new hampshire that agreement signed july 22 was one of the first global monetary policy and currency agreements re establishing a gold standard for exchange rates backing away from competitive devaluations and setting up the international monetary fund to bridge balance of payments gaps but as the bretton woods pact turns 75 that spirit of cooperation whether on exchange rates or trade is waning trade protectionism is on

live bse live nse live volume todays l h more one of the most debated topics of the 2019 union budget presented by finance minister nirmala sitharaman was india s proposal to issue sovereign bonds in the global market in external currencies as these bonds are fixed debt instruments issued by the government either in domestic or foreign currencies which is like raising a loan in the international market sovereign bonds have an interest outlay in the form of coupon payments where the principle amount is paid at maturity story continues below advertisement remove ad although the step would integrate the indian economy in global markets it is debated that there is high risk involved the coupon interest is decided by three factors india s credit profile which at present is baa2 stable as per moody s the country s internal and external risk factors like sudden shooting up of fiscal deficit and volatility of exchange rates between rupees and the foreign currency national wealth or national debt the world s overall debt is estimated at 63 trillion as of 2017 this is because more countries are borrowing to raise funds by issuing similar bonds story continues below advertisement remove ad in 1921 one of america s greatest inventors thomas edison had written in a new york times article any time we wish to add to the national wealth we are compelled to add to the national debt as per the 2017 figures of imf this is the distribution of government debt as a percentage of gdp by visual capitalist coming back to india s move the rational for the decision presented in the budget speech is india s lowest sovereign external debt to gdp ratio story continues below advertisement remove ad the fm said india s sovereign external debt to gdp is among the lowest globally at less than 5 percent the government would start raising a part of its gross borrowing programme in external markets in external currencies this will also have beneficial impact on demand situation for the government securities in domestic market original sin investors who subscribe to these bonds include large banks and several countries have been part of this original sin meaning a country cannot raise funds in its own currency in a foreign market but has to borrow in dollars or euros hence smaller developing countries lack the capacity to issue these bonds on their own and seek aid from institutions like the world bank which would have its own set of rules for borrowing moreover as the us dollar is the resolve currency it affects the market with greater implications expert take the idea of borrowing by issuing bonds is being shelved by experts who believe there is reason india never resorted to such a move despite staring at a slowdown in the economy during 1990 91 2007 08 and 2013 other points of disagreement include uncertainty of sovereign rating rupee depreciation expansion of current account deficit etc on the other hand india could wait a little longer to issue domestic bonds instead of borrowing via sovereign bonds former rbi governor 1992 97 c rangarajan in an interview with cnbc raised concerns on the rationality of sovereign debt in foreign currency he said that by and large it is not a welcome move and must be based on a country s ability to repay the borrowed amount he added that borrowing in foreign currencies may expose the economy to risks as the rupee s depreciation or current account deficit cannot be contained in the long run on the other hand this method will not be able to help the country meet its obligations by simply printing more domestic currency rising fiscal costs according to a recently article the bureaucrats pushing the idea right now to make up for tax revenue shortfalls would have retired by then leaving it to the rest of the economy especially future generations of taxpayers to cope with the rising fiscal costs the intention of a long term borrowing is associated with growth led by investment and not short term needs therefore a long time horizon cannot ensure or hedge against exchange rate risks which increases the burden in repayment at the time of maturity it could further reduce the efficiency of various monetary policies moreover low inflation rate will have to be maintained consistently as per experts jahangir aziz economist at jpmorgan has questioned the government s move stating after resisting for 75 years why does the government believe that the time is now right to commit the original sin for which many emerging markets have suffered immensely the impact of forex borrowing in international markets can reduce interest rates but any change in foreign exchange forex can turn expensive countries like mexico indonesia brazil and russia have experienced massive pressure from international investors to repay debt in one instance elliott capital went on to seize argentina s naval vessel to recover its dues bank of america merrill lynch s jayesh mehta said sovereign bond issuances overseas need to be done in a planned manner the government should do it consistently for the next five years because then it will help create secondary market liquidity around the world supporters who second the proposal are of the view that foreign markets will discipline the government with integration in the global bonds market when fiscal responsibility and budget management frbm rules are in place with an advantage of lower interest rates abroad the domestic market can be left for the private issuers assistant professor at iim ranchi amarendu nandy said in such a scenario india s benchmark yield at around 7 percent and a relatively stable currency should help attract a sizeable amount of inflow into the domestic debt market from a diverse set of investors and aid indian sovereign bonds to get into global bond indices the sovereign foreign currency borrowing rate could serve as a useful benchmark for external commercial borrowings as well lower risk there are some who consider that sovereign bonds have evolved over the years bank for international settlements mentioned in a research paper that the risk gap of these bonds have narrowed we document that sovereign risk tends to be less when bonds are issued in local rather than foreign currency but that the gap has narrowed considerably over time we find that the gap narrows when foreign exchange reserves are higher foreign borrowing is lower banks hold more government debt and global volatility is less at the same time we find no support for the view that debt in local currency is safer because of sovereigns willingness to inflate away their local debt nonetheless ananth narayan associate professor of finance at sp jain institute of management and research said india is among the few major countries globally to have never issued a sovereign bond these sovereign issuances should be useful they draw in foreign savings at a good rate for the country they free up domestic savings to be channelled into productive private investments they establish a benchmark that helps price discovery for other corporates tapping overseas credit markets on the other hand chief economic adviser krishnamurthy subramanian believes it s a once in a generation opportunity to issue sovereign bonds to help boost national wealth while the move is expected to ease the burden on indian institutions there are economies that have seen a bitter past in the global bond market it remains to be seen whether history will be created or repeated in future
with brent d griffiths the ticker president trump s rhetorical assault on federal reserve chair jerome powell is meeting resistance from an unlikely source congressional republicans as powell appeared on capitol hill for two days of semiannual testimony this week gop lawmakers in both chambers went out of their way to praise his performance at the helm of the central bank and emphasize the importance of maintaining the fed s independence from political pressure republicans didn t invoke trump s name directly but their point was clear the president s jawboning of powell a sustained complaint that turns a year old next friday is wearing thin and trump should be wary about making good on his threats to try to fire or demote powell thank you for your service sen richard shelby r ala told the fed chief in his appearance before the senate banking committee on thursday thank you for your work to keep the federal reserve independent of both parties and do your job for what it was set up to be we salute you for that advertisement sen pat toomey r pa told powell he was happy to hear him say in testimony wednesday before the house financial services committee that he intended to serve out his full four year term atop the fed in part because i do think it s important the fed remain insulated from political pressure i also want to say that i think you ve done an outstanding job toomey in a bloomberg tv interview on wednesday said removing powell would be a very bad idea powell collected similar attaboys in the house i think you are doing an outstanding job chair powell said rep andy barr r ky and rep david scott d ga urged him to stay strong the president can t fire you we in congress both democrats and republicans got your back powell asserted wednesday that he wouldn t leave if trump tried to fire him and he told lawmakers that he is accountable to you and the public yet trump insists he has the authority and just hasn t decided to use it i have the right to do that the president said to nbc last month of demoting powell and he told the hill he could fire powell outright if i wanted to but i have no plans to do anything advertisement the law governing the fed states the president could only remove powell for cause a standard that requires illegal behavior or serious malfeasance not a difference of opinion over the direction of policy whether trump could demote powell is murkier and peter conti brown a financial historian who studies the fed at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school has argued trump could win if the matter ended up before the supreme court a fight over powell s future probably would get resolved long before then however and congress would have a critical role to play conti brown says politics is everything here so congressional support will raise the stakes for trump should he attempt to proceed he said in an email lawmakers have a pair of key levers he says they could pass legislation clarifying powell s term is shielded from presidential interference and senators could pledge to the administration they will refuse to schedule confirmation hearings for a successor if trump tries to replace powell given that power republicans sent an important signal this week with their expressions of support for the fed chief notably that goodwill didn t generate itself it s the product of a behind the scenes campaign by powell to build relationships with lawmakers in both parties advertisement i would say as far as meeting with congress is concerned i m going to wear the carpets of capitol hill out by walking those halls and meeting with members powell said in an interview with marketplace radio last july i feel like that s a really important thing that the chair can do by that point powell had invested considerable time in the project traveling that february for example to the republicans house financial services committee retreat in maryland my colleague heather long reported last year now 16 months into the job powell has met with lawmakers individually or in small groups 116 times the wall street journal calculates here s a closer look by reuters at powell s outreach trump in the meantime has gone zero for four winning senate confirmation of his most recent fed nominees with senators balking at the last two in part over concern about their loyalty to the president advertisement the show of support for powell isn t unprecedented alan greenspan and paul volcker before him both enjoyed bipartisan displays of support on the hill but it has become a rarer phenomenon since 2008 conti brown says it is important to see its resurgence given congress s enormous role to play here he says for those who see the trump administration swallowing congress whole yesterday s hearings are a strong counterpoint they are also a warning president trump will interfere with monetary policy at his peril given congress s strong support for the federal reserve and its chair market

transcript of the conference call on the release of the imf staff report on the extended fund facility arrangement for pakistan ernesto ramirez rigo mission chief for pakistan middle east and central asia department olga stankova special assistant to the director communications department ms stankova good afternoon everyone and good morning to those who are joining us in the morning time thank you for joining us for this call on the release of the imf staff report on the extended fund facility arrangement for pakistan the conference call is on the record and it is under embargo until 11 00 a m d c time you also have available for you the staff report and associated documents under embargo until 11 00 a m washington time with this i will pass the microphone to ernesto ramirez rigo mission chief for pakistan in the imf middle eastern and central asia department ernesto will make opening remarks summarizing the staff report and then we will open the floor for questions over to you ernesto mr ramirez rigo thank you very much olga good morning for those that are in our time zone good afternoon for those that are in pakistan time zone my name is ernesto ramirez rigo i m mission chief for pakistan as olga has explained let me just give you a brief review of all the documents that you are going to be seeing or that you see under embargo currently obviously the overarching objective of the authorities program is to restore external and internal balance in pakistan so that pakistan can resume sustainable growth i think the government s program that is now supported with the fund program has two main pillars and then i will develop a little bit each one of them to explain them the first pillar is obviously macroeconomic stabilization the second pillar is to strengthen and build institutions on the first pillar of macroeconomic stabilization that is critical for restoring external and internal balance the focus on the fiscal side given the large deficits and the high debt is to basically improve revenue mobilization throughout all of our discussions with the authorities and other stakeholders i think we all came to the same assessment and it is the main problem in pakistan its low level of revenue collections relative to gdp and relative to many other emerging markets and peer countries so there is where we have put the focus we have put the focus on increasing revenues by broadening the tax base not by increasing tax rates while making sure that the share of population contributing to revenues is increased and in trying not to continue with exemptions and concessions which have been a major source of leakage in the tax base in addition to that of course given the external sector conditions we have put focus on having a flexible market determined exchange rate which should help restore balance and which is going to help develop the local financial markets which are fundamental for growth and in the medium term every country needs to have financial deepening the flexible market determined exchange rate will also improve the conditions for local producers and for the exporting sector in addition there is a third pillar on the macroeconomic stabilization is basically increasing social spending as everybody knows and as you probably have already analyzed the budget there is quite a substantial increase on some of the social programs included in the budget that is something that we very much welcome and we definitely wanted to make sure that the adjustment was on the revenue side not on the expenditure side and i think the budget sends quite a strong signal in that direction now let me turn to the other main pillar of the adjustment which is building institutions this is going to have to be done in parallel so it is not the sequencing is going to be is going to follow at the same time as the macroeconomic stabilization is put in place and this is basically about improving business doing business in pakistan about reducing red tape streamlining the regulations having tax policy reform that includes the tax system in pakistan which we all know is very complex and difficult to navigate and is not something that businessmen look at as a positive we want to have increasing investment and obviously there will have to be an accompanying reduction in consumption so more investment less consumption more exports more green field operations in pakistan is something that we are looking for and we are also going to we are also hoping that through improved tax compliance and a new system of tax administration that will be quite an incentive for investors the imf program basically is going to act as a catalyst where we basically provide a framework on which many other international partners are going to be participating and the total amount of financing that the program is going to be unlocking is around 38 billion i think you might have seen already that in our press release after the approval of the program basically the fund opens the door for bilateral countries and multilaterals to also extend the financing to pakistan the world bank the adb the islamic development bank and so on to also come in and provide additional financing this financing should will help release pressure and allow time for the reforms to take hold in pakistan i think with that i m going to leave it at that and we can answer your questions ms stankova thank you very much that was a very comprehensive description of the program and now ryan please help us and moderate the question and answer session we will take the question from the journalists now questioner my question is that the imf has demand from pakistan that detail of cpac debt inaudible pakistan will get from china and is it possibility that pakistan can pay back cpac amount from this 6 billion and inaudible can pakistan pay back to inaudible already give pakistan almost 5 million can pakistan pay back from this amount these inaudible and uae amount and interfere with the cpac inaudible pay back by imf amount questioner thank you very much hello good day and good morning in d c and good night here the question is that the budget that has just been announced has set a target for the largest the revenue connection jump in a fiscal year that s probably been seen in a very long time some people say that the 37 percent jump is a record in pakistan s history but in any at any rate it s a very major jump is this achievable because there is a lot of skepticism on the ground here from various quarters and that s not just because of the slow down which will definitely come with the economy but also because of the working of fbr the federal board of revenue the tax collection agency which seems to have a number of internal issues it s not just corruption but also issues related to inefficiency and outdated systems which haven t been reformed fine tuned over time so if you could address that please thank you very much questioner can you give us an idea of how pakistan s external financing requirements are going to increase over the program period and beyond and whether or not how realistic is it to understand that this will be pakistan s last imf program and how far the conditions help establish the grounds to break this cycle of eternal return to the imf that pakistan has been stuck in for the past 30 years ms stankova thank you at this point we will start answering questions mr ramirez rigo i m going to answer the questions in the order that we received them i think these are very good questions that have been asked i think many many other people are wondering exactly the same type of things about whether debt sustainability is at hand whether there is debt transparency in the budget the revenue targets tax administration and external financing so i m going to start with the first question i we certainty believed that we have everything that is necessary for us to do our debt sustainability analysis and in fact you will see in the document that there is quite an extensive discussion about the debt position of pakistan the government of pakistan let me also clarify that this information has been available for a long time in the information that the government publishes in its economic survey annually and of course that information has been supplemented in our discussions so we do not have any doubt that we have the necessary information now you mentioned somebody mentioned the issue of capacity to repay on the basis of the information that is available we certainly think there is debt sustainability under the program is going to be assured it does require though a very ambitious fiscal effort it does require that the international partners contribute by maintaining exposure in pakistan during the program period but we do feel that there is the conditions are in place of this in terms of the budget revenue as i said at the beginning the focus was on revenue increasing and not on expenditure cutting it s a very ambitious budget like the program it is the authorities definitely have a strong commitment to turn around a page on this issue of no revenue collections i think that in terms of the revenue side there are several components that go into forming these numbers that have been talked about one is tax policy driven two is the impact of the economy on the tax policy front we don t have any doubt that this is going to be that this has been done it s all the exemptions that were eliminated in our estimation with together with fbr amounted to nearly 1 7 percent of gdp the second component though is more complicated to estimate which is what s the impact of the economic growth and the impact of tax administration capacity in collection we do recognize this is a race but the it is a long run race and the authorities are strongly committed to improving the tax administration our colleagues at the world bank have recently signed quite an extensive program with fbr to improve tax administration it s going to require work yes but is it not an impossible work to do now in terms of the external financing i would say that what we actually expect is external financing to be declining not increasing that s the whole purpose of the program and of our program so external financing will decline over time the financing is going to be obtained from the international partners as we are basically reporting in our document critical to it are going to be the multilateral institutions ourselves as well but of course as well china saudi arabia and the uae and i think whether this is the last program or not that s really what matters whether we set the stage for the lasting improvement and conditions in pakistan for sustainable growth and for external and internal balance we certainly think there is hope that this program will set those conditions and this is why the imf board supports the program questioner thank you very much and thanking the chair inaudible there seems to be a lot of skepticism especially among people outside the government who will be to the extent to which this program will succeed and part of that has to do with pakistan s own inaudible kind of programs but there are lots of people who also believe that after the last program in which pakistan got a record number of libor 13 libor altogether under former prime minister nawaz sharif that this time around it would be somewhat awkward for the imf to swing the pendulum to the other extreme to go completely tight especially in a situation where the economy is definitely going to slow down further what do you report on that and also if i may ask you on the future of pakistan you said you re not making public sector companies which continue to do such a big drain on the economy it s sort of fact that the government has promised to speed up the process of privatization but these promises have been made inaudible over the years and what we ve seen is that progress has lagged behind lip services or promises how can an ordinary pakistani be convinced that this time around the future is going to be different questioner i m sorry i missed a little bit of the earlier part of the call what i wanted to know were two things first if you can give a bit more detail on the rest of the money i think the segue you used in your statement was 36 billion which is going to come forward as part of this imf program where all is that coming from sorry 38 billion and secondly inaudible the government is forecasting a very sharp an economic slowdown growth is basically going to have compared to a couple of years ago so how fast do you think the economy can recover or is this going to be a prolonged period of very slow growth questioner good morning my question is do you think that change in pakistan is near to the reality or is there more potential or do you think it should be more depressed against dollar and the second question is do you think that pakistan launched inaudible eurobond in interests of two to three months is that a good time for pakistan to launch inaudible all eurobond mr ramirez rigo so i think unlike before i m going to start from the last two questions and then come back to the first one that was asked in terms of is it a good timing for the eurobonds and accessing the market well that s something that the authorities need to decide on the basis of their own market intelligence and market analysis obviously normally after an imf program approval and given that the authorities have taken some very significant and good policy measures conditions tend to improve i think especially international investors do look at international support from ifi as an indication that the policies are in the right direction so perhaps that is a bit of a window of opportunity but at the same time it is definitely up to the authorities to decide when the timing is best in terms of the exchange rate question that was asked i think the exchange rate is already in reality because essentially as the governor has explained previously the exchange rate regime has moved to a flexible market determined exchange rate so at the moment the market that s what it s thinking that this is the right exchange rate now in terms of the financing that has been mentioned the 38 billion includes the imf includes the multilaterals world bank adb idb and so on inaudible china saudi and eui and then i d just like to turn to the more complicated question about a skepticism i mean i think it s quite understandable that there is a skepticism outside the government in terms of the program there is no denying that we have pakistani are repeat adducer of imf resources the international community obviously has also this issue but what we like to emphasize is that the inaudible have the results to implement the program that has a lot of upfront action they ve done and with even in the budget in this occasion we re aiming for revenue mobilization through elimination of tax exemptions and privileges that in the past we have not addressed that gives us also comfort that there is political will to implement it but this is not going to be assured a inaudible it s going to be it is like the marathon there are a lot of things that need to be implemented especially in the structure outside that is really critical but the whole thing is whether this thing is going to be different or not from the past is going to depend very much on the pakistanis it doesn t one thing is to provide a macroeconomic framework and to receive support from the international partners but ultimately the consistency and the steadfast implementation is key not only during the program period but also after the program period let s not forget pakistan has already legislation in place like the fiscal debt responsibility legislation act which in principle should have limited the quantity of fiscal deficits and debt but if it is not implemented there might be another day no matter whether there is a good successfully completed program or not this is not going to improve conditions but this time around i think at least the starting point is a strong one and we certainly think there is the commitment turning to the issue of the state of enterprises that someone correctly identify as a major drain on the budget obviously we agree the authorities agree it is in the program but the issue is not only about privatization far from it i think the way we are thinking and the authorities have been thinking about it is let s start doing first a triage basically look at all these major state of enterprises let s decide which ones are in good condition and should be run more commercially which ones are in bad condition and should be considered for either closure or restructuring and let s see which ones should not be in public hands at all and should be privatized and that is going to take some time there are some targets in the memorandum of economic and financial policies and you will see the dates there in addition we have also agreed to do audit on the three main states of enterprises pia the railway company and the steel company which i think is very important to improve transparency and get a good understanding on exactly what is the problem in this company and then whatever the decision is the authorities have a few things in the store but on the positive side from the perspective of the program this privatization is really not something on which we are counting at the onset as an additional source of known tax revenue questioner i work for the news and my question is as you had mentioned that there is more focus on revenue side there is the fiscal consideration for instance you have already projected the budget deficit of 7 3 percent of gdp in the current financial year the dwi started off at 7 1 percent and i want to remind you already the basis of the budget making is already shaken for instance fdr s device target of 4150 billion they have missed around 300 billion rupees so the whole business of the varying target of rupees 5 5 billion have already shaken so how lbr is going to achieve around 43 percent growth which had never happened in pakistan history what shall we inaudible questioner there s an indication that the governances are ready to offer and place their inaudible gdp 3 7 versus gdp of the last two years what is the assurance that they ll deliver on this promise when they have not been able to deliver on bank inaudible delivery target and second there are a number of educations where that suggests pakistan are going to introduce a number of laws to get them passed given the moderate strength of the inaudible how do you think it is achievable mr ramirez rigo excuse me sir could you repeat the last part of your question the sound was very bad and i couldn t catch it i understood the first part about the provinces and the fiscal objectives but not the second questioner you know the indication that pakistan inaudible has asked you change their large in different areas including that indication and many others given the inaudible percent of the ppi going back in pakistan how would we expect such inaudible can be part questioner i just have two very short questions one is by when is the fund now expected to be dispersed and exactly date does the program can we say that the program has begun and by when will pakistan actually receive the money and number two are we reading this program correctly if we understand that it seems to be rather light on structural reforms because i m not seeing a lot of commitment for structural reform here aside from perhaps revenue increases so increases in the tax base at the outset of the program mr ramirez rigo so i m going to start with the first question about revenues which if i understood correctly it s asking whether the revenue target can be achieved let me first clarify at the beginning of the question the gentleman mentioned that there is not adjustment because the fiscal deficit is basically almost unchanged compared to the previous one i think what people are missing and it s very very important to focus on is that the targets are set on the primary balance and not on the overall balance and the reason why this has been done is because the primary balance is a much better indicator of fiscal efforts in a situation like this one where the discretion of components of the authority s polices which can be measured whereas on the interest bill which is going to be market determined and if it filled domestic market financing there is no direct control so essentially if you look at the primary balance that is when you really are going to see what is that that government is doing and what is therefore under the program which is quite substantial and ambitious and ongoing with that is the issue of revenues and this is going to be based on the elimination of tax exemptions i think most of you have probably read or even written about the issue of eliminating for the main five sectors the exemption of gst on domestic sales of their produce or their goods that is critical for the objective that sdr has for revenue less so is the issue of growth because obviously on that front we together with the authorities are aware that there is going to be some consideration and also important is going to be tax administration improvement they are already working on it it s going to be a prolonged effort on the part but we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve these numbers for the provinces the issue of the provinces you know and as you know well the constitution granted a lot of autonomy and basically we have worked together with the federal government and the provinces and met with the provincial ministers of finance to discuss in detail what is included on the fiscal side i think we feel that there is comfort in the fact that they have signed memorandums of understandings between the federal government and the provinces a committee meant to the principle of delivering on the fiscal adjustment in addition to that when we met with the ministers we found a lot of understanding on their part that this has a joint effort it s not just a federal government effort and given that the federal government shares nearly 57 percent of most of the revenues with the provinces in automatic way their willingness was to as long as they the sdr and the federal government deliver on the revenue side they will be willing to contribute to the savings now it is true that the program includes reforms that require legislative change for example very important for us is going to be the independence of the central bank it s going to be important for us and for the authorities as well the issue of more than the legislation for the state owned enterprises and these things will require passage for the national assembly as in many other democracies and yes the pti started moderating in the lower house and not in the upper house so it will require building consensus and that s why in part we tabled the sequencing in a way that will allow for the building of that consensus and hopefully there will be a possibility that they get passed finally the program started on the 3rd of july which is when the imf board approved the program the first disbursement should be either today or tomorrow already with the central bank of pakistan and there is structural conditionality that has been mentioned as very light i m glad some of you think it s light i don t think it was seen like that by many other people i think we re trying to put the focus on really what matters and to be parsimonious i think if we can get a list four or five things early in the program period for example independent of the central bank tax policy reform legislation on its state owned enterprises i think that would be really important to cement the gains from the macroeconomic stabilization ms stankova and to just add in case on one of your questions on the amount of the first disbursement it s about usd1 billion and then thank you the question please questioner hi i wonder if you could tell me what are the potential risks you re looking at in particular that you know what are the sort of essential points about the program s successful implementation and what are the downside risks that the government faces toward getting successful implementation questioner thank you very much i just want to go back to the matter of privatization and also to echo what inaudible said in iran the program looking short on structural reforms as opposed to a inaudible term stabilization you know the trouble is that in pakistan s system whenever a new government has come to office in the last 30 years they ve talked about reforming restructuring bodies like the pia steel mills but it doesn t work one figure making the rounds is that from the last time that the still mill characterization failed more than a decade ago the most it s so far in these past 11 years are equivalent to the cost that would have been incurred for setting up a new mega steel mill in pakistan fundamentally it seems like a dead causing turning around these companies wouldn t it be smarter for pakistan and for the imf to push for that end that these entities are privatized as quickly as possible at whatever cost possible just so that they stop they stop being a drain on the federal exchequer questioner hello sorry i just want you to reiterate the earlier question about how long you see the sort of stabilization trends lasting so that you know when can this government which obviously has some political goals looking forward to growth kicking in again mr ramirez rigo i m sorry i missed answering your question about growth and the stabilization i missed that so let me start right away with that one you mentioned that growth is decelerating sharply i wouldn t depict it as such growth is actually expected to be 2 4 percent in this fiscal year compared to 3 3 percent the previous fiscal year obviously there are several components that have gone into the forecast one of them is the impact of the fiscal multipliers and the fact that the fiscal adjustment is going to have on domestic demand which we expect it to be a drain on domestic demand at the same time we are taking into account the improvement and confidence that having a program should have on investors and on the domestic investors which are even perhaps more important in terms of when will growth return well we re expecting growth i believe again at 3 percent the following year and then after moving towards pakistan s potential and in the range of 4 5 to 5 percent before the end of the program period so i think it is relatively shallow the federation in economic activity because in a way the external position it requires that and at the same time the external demand at this point is not as strong as in the past but at the same time the initial conditions are probably not one that you could describe as a crisis type of situation at the same time that brings us what are those risks to the program i think there are several risks one obviously the price of oil could provide us a negative surprise for the oil prices increase significantly from here given how big they are and what a big share of imports they constitute and how elastic they are domestic demand enterprises obviously that would be complicated in addition to that then there are the domestic risks perhaps implementation of some of these policies is more complex that we have assumed consensus is harder to reach and that could slow down the process of program implementation finally the issue of privatization well it is right that some of these companies are a major drain the program includes quite a battery of measures in it and that s found to be with the state owned enterprises and the question is between frontloading versus gradualism i think sometimes trying to move too quickly presents challenges even a local legal nature our understanding is that what the authorities want to do provide a better opportunity to do it right this time and to finally address the issue a list of these major companies that have been for such a long time a drain on the exchequer ms stankova thank you i think with this we will wrap up the call a lot of questions answered thank you very much ernesto a lot of grounds covered mr ramirez rigo sure ms stankova if you have any questions of course please free to email to us we ll do our best to answer you you have my email and phone number on media advisory just to remind you the conference call was on the record it s embargoed until 11 00 a m d c washington time which is about another 15 minutes before this can be reported as well as the documents under the same embargo and thank you very much for joining us today and have a good day goodbye
after long delays and arduous negotiations the government of pakistan and the international monetary fund imf have finally reached a loan agreement on july 3 the imf executive committee approved a three year 6 billion u s dollars loan plan for pakistan as we all know imf much influenced by the united states and the west has many stringent conditions for lending to any country only by meeting the conditions can a country get the loan moreover the imf has said that its board of directors has approved an immediate payment of about 1 billion u s dollars to pakistan and that the rest of the loan would be paid in phases with quarterly reviews it is reported that pakistan will have received the entirety of the 6 billion u s dollars loan from imf by the fiscal year 2022 but will have to repay 4 35 billion of previous debt to the imf by the fiscal year of 2023 with a net increase of only 1 65 billion in the real loan received historically pakistan has accepted imf loans 21 times and carried out economic reforms according to imf conditions but pakistan has never been able to achieve sustainable economic development the main reason is that imf prescribes measures for pakistan according to the standards of western developed countries and its textbook reform program does not conform to pakistan s national conditions so it is difficult to achieve results for example imf forces the central bank of pakistan to raise its benchmark interest rate by 150 base points to 12 25 in western countries people rely heavily on bank lending for their daily consumption so raising interest rates does help to control inflation but for pakistan bank lending is mainly used for productive activities rather than consumption the benchmark interest rate above 12 would severely limit private sector lending and eventually lead to a further decline in pakistan s domestic production capacity pakistan has repeatedly sought loans from imf and accepted its reform program with which pakistan has not only been unable to fundamentally solve its economic problems but has also suffered from serious side effects the most serious problem is that the imf reform program which includes a floating exchange rate steep tax increases higher electricity and gas prices is directly leading to an increase in the tax burden higher cost of living and more debilitating poverty afflicting the pakistani people it is well understood that the government of pakistan has to borrow money from the imf in the face of serious financial difficulties however in order to achieve sustainable and high quality economic development in the long term and truly improve the people s living standards pakistan needs to choose its own development path that suits its national conditions and develop economic cooperation with partner countries that are able and willing to help pakistan in order to promote social and economic development in an all round way pakistan should broaden its horizons and formulate long term development strategies first pakistan should firmly put national interests and economic development in the first place all central authorities all political parties and all local governments should stop fighting for narrow interests and cooperate and coordinate with each other effectively second it should make full use of the huge development dividend unleashed by the cpec take the manufacturing industry as the orientation carefully study the current situation and needs of development in various regions and industries and formulate and implement the national development strategy third it should adopt active fiscal and business promotion policies moderately reduce bank interest rates and tax rates on commodity services encourage investment production and consumption help enterprises and people to reduce production and living costs simplify the administrative approval process and gradually achieve the goal of tax increase by stimulating economic development cheng xizhong special commentator of china economic net visiting professor at southwest university of political science and law senior fellow of the charhar institute

by j bradford delong berkeley why did the policy response to the great recession only partly reflect the lessons learned from the great depression until recently the smart money was on the answers given by the financial times commentator martin wolf and my berkeley colleague barry eichengreen each has argued that while enough was remembered to prevent the 1929 size shock of 2008 from producing another great depression many lessons were plowed under by a rightward ideological shift in the years following the crisis since then the fact that the worst was avoided has served as an alibi for a suboptimal status quo now nobel laureate economist paul krugman has offered an alternative explanation plutocracy at the start of the 2010s the top 0 01 per cent 30 000 people around the world half of them in the united states cared little about high unemployment which did not seem to affect them but were greatly alarmed by government debt they began demanding austerity and as krugman contends the political and media establishment internalised the preferences of the extremely wealthy would the us economy of the 2010s have been materially different if the share of total income accruing to the top 0 01 per cent had not quadrupled in recent decades from 1 3 per cent to 5 per cent krugman certainly thinks so while vigilance can mitigate the extent to which the wealthy get to define the policy agenda he writes in the end big money will find a way unless there s less big money to begin with hence curbing plutocracy should be america s top priority in fact big money does not always find a way nor does its influence necessarily increase as the top 0 01 per cent captures a larger share of total income whether the average plutocrat has 1 000 or 50 000 times more than the average worker makes little difference in this respect more to the point big money was not the primary determinant of whether policymakers heeded or forgot the lessons of the great depression for example one lesson from that earlier episode is that high unemployment is extremely unhealthy for an economy and society a depression is not as the early twentieth century economist joseph schumpeter once claimed a good cold douche for the economy but this lesson was forgotten only by a lunatic fringe some of whom suggested that the great recession was needed to shift workers out of bloated sectors such as home construction as for lessons that were forgotten one is that persistent ultra low interest rates means the economy is still short of safe liquid stores of value and thus in need of further monetary expansion during and after the great recession denying this plain truth and calling for an end to stimulus became a litmus test for any republican holding or seeking office worse these politicians were joined by an astonishingly large number of conservative economists who conveniently seemed to forget that the short term safe interest rate is a good thermometer for the economy to be sure big finance did play a role here by insisting that the fed was trying to push value away from fundamentals even though economic fundamentals are generally whatever the fed says they are but an even more obvious culprit was hyper partisanship another lesson is that printing or borrowing money to buy stuff is an effective means for governments to address worryingly high unemployment after 2009 the obama administration effectively rejected this lesson in favour of the logic of austerity even though the unemployment rate was still 9 9 per cent a related lesson is that high levels of government debt need not lead to price instability or an inflationary spiral as john maynard keynes argued in january 1937 the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity at the treasury unfortunately in the early 2010s those of us who recalled this lesson were consigned to the margins of debate yet here big money influence was a secondary problem compared to the democratic party s broader surrender to neoliberalism which started under president bill clinton but reached its apotheosis in the obama era after all the plutocracy itself profits when money is cheap and lending is dear the larger issue then is an absence of alternative voices if the 2010s had been anything like the 1930s the national association of manufacturers and the conference board would have been aggressively calling for more investment in america and these arguments would have commanded the attention of the press labour unions would have had a prominent voice as advocates for a high pressure economy both would have had very powerful voices inside the political process through their support of candidates did the top 0 01 per cent put something in the water to make the media freeze out such voices after 2008 did the ultra wealthy create our modern campaign finance system in which elite social networks and door to door canvassing are less important than a candidate s fund raising totals the problem is not so much that the plutocracy has grown stronger as that countervailing powers have disappeared after all there are wealthy donors and philanthropists on the left as well as the right and some billionaires have even started to demand that they be taxed more of course the political implications of plutocracy are dangerous and destructive in the us olin money has captured the judiciary koch money has misinformed the public about global warming and murdoch money routinely terrifies retirees about immigrants but just because the public sphere is tainted and skewed by plutocratic influence does not mean that more rational policymaking is doomed once we are aware of the problem we can begin to work around it 1 krugman admits as much when he warns centrist politicians and the media not to pull another 2011 treating the policy preferences of the 0 1 per cent as the right thing as opposed to well what a certain small class of people want for journalists academics elected officials and concerned citizens generally the first task is to ask oneself everyday whose voices are getting more attention than they deserve and who is not being heard at all ultimately it is the public that will decide the fate of the public sphere j bradford delong is professor of economics at the university of california at berkeley and a research associate at the national bureau of economic research he was deputy assistant us treasury secretary during the clinton administration where he was heavily involved in budget and trade negotiations his role in designing the bailout of mexico during the 1994 peso

the greek election results were first and foremost a victory for the center right new democracy whose nearly 40 percent of the vote secured it an absolute majority in parliament for the time since 2009 when the center left pasok panhellenic socialist movement last won an election a single party will form the government throughout most of the crisis greece has been run by coalitions including syriza s pact with the right wing anel independent greeks but new democracy s victory has formally brought that period to an end political stability has returned to greece and the traditional forces of government are back in power in practice this stability began to return in late 2015 when syriza surrendered to the european union and signed a bailout agreement with greece s lenders new democracy s victory is primarily the result of the four years of austerity syriza applied at the behest of the lenders hitting middle to low incomes hard and reducing national and popular sovereignty syriza s conservative foreign policy turning greece into a committed military and political ally of the united states and israel in the eastern mediterranean was a further factor in this defeat particularly as it led syriza to cut a deal on north macedonia s official name that was rejected by broad swathes of greek public opinion however syriza s defeat mostly owed to the economic and social policies it adopted after its capitulation to the eu considering that syriza originally promised a radical challenge to the greek and european status quo its evolution has been nothing short of disgraceful alexis tsipras and his party are a lesson in what the european radical left ought to avoid in years to come new democracy will not find it easy to keep its own promises the rigid economic policy framework imposed on greece by its lenders will ensure weak growth low incomes and sustained pressure on workers and the middle class the country might have turned to the right in reaction to syriza s policies but the conditions for long term social and political stability simply do not exist equally while in opposition syriza will focus on becoming the alternative party of government and reestablishing a new two party system it will also find its task far from easy there is however a deeper problem the parties of the radical left have either done very badly or proven untrustworthy the challenge is to reestablish a greek radical left connected with working people and articulating a transformative program that truly speaks to society s problems in this respect greece does still have lessons to offer for it is not so different from the rest of europe electoral shifts to understand syriza s defeat it is vital to consider some evidence about the electoral performance of the main parties of government during the decade of crisis the table shows all national parliamentary elections since october 2009 i have rounded the figures to make it easier to follow the figures for the greek electorate have remained stable at around 10 million throughout this period there is very good reason to doubt the accuracy of this number as the electoral rolls appear to be badly out of date though here we in any case focus on absolute figures parliamentary election results in greece october 2009 may 2012 june 2012 january 2015 september 2015 july 2019 abstention 29 35 38 36 44 42 syriza 5 0 32m 17 1 06m 27 1 66m 36 2 25m 35 1 93m 32 1 79m new democracy 33 2 36m 19 1 19m 30 1 83m 28 1 72m 28 1 53m 40 2 25m pasok 44 3 01m 13 0 85m 12 0 76m 5 0 62m several important political conclusions are immediately apparent first the abstention rate has risen significantly indicating that greeks are profoundly disillusioned with parliamentary politics this percentage is probably substantially exaggerated given the poor quality of the electoral rolls but the rise is not in doubt the rising trend goes back a long time and became stronger during the deep crisis of the last decade when syriza rose to power in january 2015 abstention declined as the country looked to the left and there was a new enthusiasm for politics syriza s surrender after the notorious referendum in the summer of 2015 destroyed hope and disillusionment returned abstention declined once again on sunday but has remained very high and this time the turn was to the right syriza s real legacy for greek politics is that it has reinforced apathy and discredited the left the outbreak of the crisis severely damaged the electoral appeal of new democracy which registered just 1 19 million votes in may 2012 rising to 1 83 million in june 2012 when it formed a government but in january 2015 when syriza first won new democracy s votes fell to 1 72 million and then collapsed to 1 53 million in the september 2015 contest when syriza won again in the immediate aftermath of its capitulation this is the benchmark against which to judge new democracy s resurgence in sunday s election its vote jumped to 2 25 million nearly the same as in october 2009 the reason why the center right won on sunday with an apparently large 40 percent score is that far more people abstained compared to 2009 syriza s rule has certainly rejuvenated new democracy but it is important to keep in mind the center right s true electoral strength syriza emerged from the margins of greek politics in 2012 by taking advantage of the massive wave of anger regarding bailout policies and the humiliation of greece its electoral support rose rapidly peaking at 2 25 million when it formed its first government in january 2015 syriza rode a tremendous wave of popular hope and increased involvement in politics even following its capitulation in summer 2015 it still managed to win the election that september with 1 93 million votes the electorate was prepared to give tsipras another chance despite his manifest lack of trustworthiness it is remarkable that after four more years of government syriza can still today collect 1 79 million votes new democracy s rise has not been matched by the equivalent decline of syriza this development will mark greek politics in the coming period and calls for explanation indeed greece appears to be returning to a two party system in which new democracy and syriza both establishment parties will alternate in power however the table brings out a further crucial point if there is going to be a new two party system it will be a threadbare version of the one that preceded the crisis despite new democracy s dominance its electoral strength is barely on a par with 2009 similarly although syriza has sustained itself it is a pale version of pasok the party it seeks to replace even in 2009 just before it commenced the relentless decline that eventually brought its marginalization and name change pasok could rally more than 3 million votes there is no evidence that syriza will ever manage this feat the causes of defeat the seeds of new democracy s victory were sown in summer 2015 when syriza surrendered to the lenders and became an establishment party it signed greece s third bailout lasting formally until august 2018 and consistently applied economic policies dictated by the eu and the imf the result was weak economic development and the alienation of broad layers of the population especially those attached to small and medium businesses which are still the backbone of the greek economy syriza accepted the bailout condition of ensuring monstrous primary balance surpluses of 3 5 percent of gdp with the aim of servicing greece s huge public debt achieving these surpluses required imposing heavy taxation the entry rate of income tax was raised to 22 percent and the maximum rate to 45 percent vat was also raised averaging 24 percent taxes on small and medium enterprises rose to 29 percent though they were recently dropped a point in a desperate attempt to placate reactions incredibly small and medium enterprises were frequently required to pay next year s taxes in advance thus throttling their operations social security rates were also raised to confront the intractable problems of the pension system but they were imposed very unequally among companies to these burdens must also be added heavy property taxes including on private houses taxes that are rightly perceived as the most unfair of all syriza had promised to abolish property taxes when it rose to power but instead maintained them to achieve the huge surplus targets syriza also systematically reduced public investment thus undermining greece s infrastructure and productive potential even worse following the dictates of the lenders it set as its main aim the return of greece to the markets the party that had risen to power by railing against the loan sharks of the global markets came to consider their approval the ultimate mark of success to this end syriza undertook an extraordinary effort to build a protective cushion of nearly 40 billion that would act as a guarantee for the markets thus it exceeded even its 3 5 percent target chalking up a surplus of 4 2 percent in 2017 the cushion was built by imposing tremendous pressure on working people and their families the markets did indeed reward tsipras for his obedience by allowing his government to reissue bonds and even brought the spread of ten year greek bonds to the remarkably low level of 2 5 percent in july 2019 this is the lowest borrowing rate greece has been able to secure since well before the crisis and the drop occurred despite its public debt standing at a record 355 billion around 180 percent of gdp the markets approval has however come at great social and political cost in light of these policies it is not at all surprising that the greek economy performed poorly in the syriza years even though it has recovered from the depths of the gigantic recession of 2010 2012 growth has been anemic barely reaching 2 percent the main cause of which is weak domestic demand due to bailout policies consumption has been largely stagnant as real incomes are not rising and household indebtedness to banks is huge the most telling indicator of ratcheting pressure on workers and their households is the enormous backlog of unpaid taxes the sum currently exceeds 100 billion or roughly 60 percent of gdp owed by nearly 4 million people and enterprises this huge debt has accumulated rapidly in recent years growing by a further 3 billion in the first quarter of 2019 its escalation has occurred despite the ruthless government policy of sequestering the private bank accounts and wage receipts of more than 1 million people the axe has fallen heavily on the poorest since at least half the debtors owe trivial sums of less than 500 private investment has also been very weak from its peak of 63 billion in 2007 it collapsed to just over 18 billion in 2015 as the recession ravaged greek industry the steepest collapse of investment was in the construction sector which has been devastated destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs investment has been persistently weak during the syriza years barely exceeding 24 billion in 2018 together with the fall in public investment imposed by syriza to achieve the exorbitant targets of primary surpluses the profound weakness of private investment has been the main reason for anemic growth greek capitalists will not invest partly because the battered country s net saving is negative leaving little room for investment growth to make prospects even bleaker greek banks are essentially bankrupt as nearly 45 percent of their assets comprise non performing loans the crisis has shattered the banks and syriza has made things worse by selling them to foreign speculative investment funds the provision of credit to the economy for investment and consumption has been steadily declining for years the only positive sign for the economy has been the growth of exports as greek enterprises turned to foreign markets during the crisis exports of goods rose to more than 33 billion in 2018 and this growth has been much trumpeted as a sign of success for the bailout policies it is less often mentioned that once the economy had stabilized imports began to rise again strongly reaching 54 billion in 2018 their growth reflects the underlying weakness of greek industry heavily dependent on imports it also makes a complete mockery of the neoliberal notion promoted by the eu the imf and the greek elite that the country could be saved by directing itself toward world markets and becoming more outward oriented greece s trade deficit has been growing since 2015 and will prove a barrier to the neoliberal strategy greece cannot and will not be saved by directing its efforts toward exports it needs a major restructuring of its productive base and strengthening of domestic consumption and investment this will not happen without systematic public intervention in short the straitjacket imposed by the lenders and accepted by syriza has stabilized greece by impoverishing it and miring it in stagnation the greek economy has not been structurally transformed it has a weak industrial sector and an uncompetitive agriculture while relying heavily on services of low productivity it is no wonder that the sector with the strongest growth in recent years has been tourism including rapid growth of airbnb tourism is a welcome boost to an economy ravaged by crisis but it represents a complete developmental dead end the inevitable result has been persistent and entrenched poverty unemployment has declined from around 27 percent in 2013 to around 18 percent in 2019 but the new jobs have typically been of very poor quality precarious and badly paid especially for the young the ilo international labour organization found that real wages declined significantly in 2017 and it is probable that they fell again in 2018 indeed in 2018 about one third of workers were paid less than 400 a month before tax during the syriza years despite the mealymouthed words about helping society to stand upright exploitation in the private sector reached fever pitch poverty has been further exacerbated by the austerity and privatization policies in welfare provision health education housing adopted as part of the syriza bailout no wonder that the exodus of skilled greeks seeking employment abroad perhaps exceeding 400 000 people during the last decade continued apace in the syriza years the capitals of europe berlin london stockholm and elsewhere abound in highly trained greeks working as doctors engineers builders and mechanics greece is losing its skilled youth while its birth rate is collapsing and its population is rapidly aging depopulation poverty and decline have resulted from implementing eu imposed policies realizing the severe social implications of its bailout policies syriza adopted a redistribution policy toward the end of its tenure part of the extraordinary surpluses in excess of the 3 5 percent target were redistributed to pensioners low income families and others through small handouts in effect the tremendous tax burden imposed on modest incomes and small and medium enterprises was partly used to shore up low or very low incomes this policy had very little to do with a socialist redistribution which would aim to rebalance the share of national income in favor of labor against capital and would seek primarily to redistribute a growing income as well as wealth as the economy expanded syriza effectively redistributed poverty within a stagnating economy in the hope of maintaining its electoral influence along similar lines after the formal end of the third bailout in august 2018 syriza decided to increase the minimum wage until 2012 the country s minimum wage stood at 751 a month but it was reduced to 586 for those over twenty five and 510 for those under twenty five the subminimum with effect from february 2019 the minimum wage was raised to 650 and the subminimum abolished close to 1 million workers were affected by these changes at the same time the government began to take some steps toward reregulating the labor market collective agreements were made generally binding and the benefits were felt by workers in several sectors including banking tourism and mining these belated measures were important in allowing syriza to avoid a steep decline in the recent election what lies ahead syriza has paid the price for capitulating to the eu and greece s lenders middle class layers turned against it especially those attached to small and medium enterprises suffering from taxation and economic stagnation they made up the increase new democracy s vote syriza did however succeeded in maintaining support in working class areas of athens piraeus thessaloniki and other parts of greece these are traditional pasok supporting areas though syriza today obtains far less votes than that party once did there is no doubt that the political initiative now belongs to the rejuvenated new democracy its new leader kyriakos mitsotakis comes from a rich family of long established political operators his own father was prime minister and many close to him are scions of well known political families they are the core of the elite that led greece to bankruptcy a decade ago now syriza has ushered them back in mitsotakis appears to have learned some lessons from the crisis and the electoral shock it delivered to new democracy he has surrounded himself with technocrats often people from enterprises and the financial markets seeking to convey an impression of efficiency modernity and progress he has promised to reduce taxation thus directly appealing to the layers battered by syriza while also vowing to boost investment in the hope of accelerating growth and providing good jobs his program and outlook are uncompromisingly neoliberal aiming to shrink and revamp the public sector presumably in order to boost the wealth creating private sector his message has found some resonance even among the young who associate the public sector with corruption inefficiency and nepotism including during the syriza years new democracy will not find it easy to deliver on its promises the straitjacket imposed by the lenders on greece leaves very little room for maneuver it will be impossible to substantially reduce the burden of taxation without negotiating a reduction in the 3 5 percent target for primary surpluses and there is no evidence that the eu will agree to that it will also be very difficult to increase investment over several years given the negative net saving and the parlous state of the banking sector even if there is a temporary uptick of investment as private capitalists feel more encouraged by the change of government the notion of systematically attracting foreign direct investment fdi is just a red herring beloved by greek conservatives and economic weather forecasters in the mass media

menafn jordan times by j bradford delong berkeley why did the policy response to the great recession only partly reflect the lessons learned from the great depression until recently the smart money was on the answers given by the financial times commentator martin wolf and my berkeley colleague barry eichengreen each has argued that while enough was remembered to prevent the 1929 size shock of 2008 from producing another great depression many lessons were plowed under by a rightward ideological shift in the years following the crisis since then the fact that the worst was avoided has served as an alibi for a suboptimal status quo now nobel laureate economist paul krugman has offered an alternative explanation plutocracy at the start of the 2010s the top 0 01 per cent 30 000 people around the world half of them in the united states cared little about high unemployment which did not seem to affect them but were greatly alarmed by government debt they began demanding austerity and as krugman contends the political and media establishment internalised the preferences of the extremely wealthy would the us economy of the 2010s have been materially different if the share of total income accruing to the top 0 01 per cent had not quadrupled in recent decades from 1 3 per cent to 5 per cent krugman certainly thinks so while vigilance can mitigate the extent to which the wealthy get to define the policy agenda he writes in the end big money will find a way unless there s less big money to begin with hence curbing plutocracy should be america s top priority in fact big money does not always find a way nor does its influence necessarily increase as the top 0 01 per cent captures a larger share of total income whether the average plutocrat has 1 000 or 50 000 times more than the average worker makes little difference in this respect more to the point big money was not the primary determinant of whether policymakers heeded or forgot the lessons of the great depression for example one lesson from that earlier episode is that high unemployment is extremely unhealthy for an economy and society a depression is not as the early twentieth century economist joseph schumpeter once claimed a good cold douche for the economy but this lesson was forgotten only by a lunatic fringe some of whom suggested that the great recession was needed to shift workers out of bloated sectors such as home construction as for lessons that were forgotten one is that persistent ultra low interest rates means the economy is still short of safe liquid stores of value and thus in need of further monetary expansion during and after the great recession denying this plain truth and calling for an end to stimulus became a litmus test for any republican holding or seeking office worse these politicians were joined by an astonishingly large number of conservative economists who conveniently seemed to forget that the short term safe interest rate is a good thermometer for the economy to be sure big finance did play a role here by insisting that the fed was trying to push value away from fundamentals even though economic fundamentals are generally whatever the fed says they are but an even more obvious culprit was hyper partisanship another lesson is that printing or borrowing money to buy stuff is an effective means for governments to address worryingly high unemployment after 2009 the obama administration effectively rejected this lesson in favour of the logic of austerity even though the unemployment rate was still 9 9 per cent a related lesson is that high levels of government debt need not lead to price instability or an inflationary spiral as john maynard keynes argued in january 1937 the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity at the treasury unfortunately in the early 2010s those of us who recalled this lesson were consigned to the margins of debate yet here big money influence was a secondary problem compared to the democratic party s broader surrender to neoliberalism which started under president bill clinton but reached its apotheosis in the obama era after all the plutocracy itself profits when money is cheap and lending is dear the larger issue then is an absence of alternative voices if the 2010s had been anything like the 1930s the national association of manufacturers and the conference board would have been aggressively calling for more investment in america and these arguments would have commanded the attention of the press labour unions would have had a prominent voice as advocates for a high pressure economy both would have had very powerful voices inside the political process through their support of candidates did the top 0 01 per cent put something in the water to make the media freeze out such voices after 2008 did the ultra wealthy create our modern campaign finance system in which elite social networks and door to door canvassing are less important than a candidate s fund raising totals the problem is not so much that the plutocracy has grown stronger as that countervailing powers have disappeared after all there are wealthy donors and philanthropists on the left as well as the right and some billionaires have even started to demand that they be taxed more of course the political implications of plutocracy are dangerous and destructive in the us olin money has captured the judiciary koch money has misinformed the public about global warming and murdoch money routinely terrifies retirees about immigrants but just because the public sphere is tainted and skewed by plutocratic influence does not mean that more rational policymaking is doomed once we are aware of the problem we can begin to work around it 1 krugman admits as much when he warns centrist politicians and the media not to pull another 2011 treating the policy preferences of the 0 1 per cent as the right thing as opposed to well what a certain small class of people want for journalists academics elected officials and concerned citizens generally the first task is to ask oneself everyday whose voices are getting more attention than they deserve and who is not being heard at all ultimately it is the public that will decide the fate of the public sphere j bradford delong is professor of economics at the university of california at berkeley and a research associate at the national bureau of economic research he was deputy assistant us treasury secretary during the clinton administration where he was heavily involved in budget and trade negotiations his role in

2018 india s per capita gross domestic product gdp was 2015 60 according to the world bank this makes sense our economy is currently sized at 2 7 trillion and our population is around 1 35 billion this is considerably behind the united states 62 641 and not even a fourth of china s 9 770 80 the bank s data show that india s gdp per capita grew by 5 9 in 2018 over 2017 that was the slowest since 5 14 in 2013 growth in per capita gdp during modi 1 0 tells the story 6 19 in 2014 6 8 in 2015 6 99 in 2016 then 6 04 in 2017 post demonetization like all good ceos prime minister narendra modi sets stretch targets we have been challenged to hit 3 trillion in gdp in fiscal 2019 20 and the new india goal is to be a 5 trillion economy by 2024 25 about time too india is projected to be the world s most populous country by 2025 with at least 1 45 billion people our per capita gdp if we hit the 5 trillion mark will be around 3 600 finance minister nirmala sitharaman said in her budget speech last friday in purchasing power parity terms we are in fact the 3rd largest economy already only next to china and the usa that is true in ppp terms although at 9 33 trillion we are considerably behind china at 22 54 trillion and the us at 18 22 trillion india s ppp per capita gdp measured in 2011 dollars rose to 6 899 in 2018 from 1 886 in 1991 when economic reforms began many economists believe ppp is a better gauge of an economy s strength you could argue that a 5 trillion economy is the minimum we should aspire to given our size and population right now india is just about at the level of lower middle income countries in ppp terms average 6 777 ahead of india are a large number of countries notably china 16 187 the united states 55 681 canada 44 051 france 39 556 germany 45 959 and

mirage stirred up by professional pessimists as the prime minister put it the economic survey drew a pragmatic blueprint for the next five years to achieve the objective of becoming a us 5 trillion economy by 2024 25 india needs to sustain a real gdp growth rate of 8 it says international experience especially from high growth east asian economies suggests that such growth can only be sustained by a virtuous cycle of savings investment and exports catalysed and supported by a favourable demographic phase how are we doing on those metrics household savings rates have declined steadily over the recent past to 17 2 in 2017 18 from 23 6 in 2011 12 our overall savings rate was at a weak 30 5 in 2017 18 from a high of 37 8 in 2008 private investment is still moribund our trade deficit is rising on the back of weak export growth the 2019 20 budget short on numbers is not likely to set off a frenzy of investment even the ambitious fiscal deficit target of 3 3 of gdp was revealed by sitharaman after her speech how will the government finance its expenditure including a rs 70 000 crore capital infusion into still struggling public sector banks and a six month credit guarantee for crisis hit nbfcs as well as its agriculture and social welfare plans gross tax revenue would have to grow in 2019 20 at more than twice the pallid rate of 8 4 in 2018 19 the gtr was hit by lower receipts from both gst and direct taxes gross government borrowings are projected at a whopping rs 7 1 trillion surging from 5 7 trillion last year simultaneously delivering on fiscal consolidation and raising incomes will be extremely challenging for india s authorities particularly since growth is likely to remain weak over the coming year moody s investor service said one senior economist told me the unrealistic number are untenable the tax authorities are being given unrealistic targets that will lead to tax terrorism he said the spending ministries are being given allocations that they cannot spend a pliant reserve bank of india has been more than happy to help it has cut interest rates three times this year and it purchased 60 of last year s government bond issues in the open market now the government is waiting expectantly for the bimal jalan committee report next week which might be the open sesame it needs to access the central bank s huge reserves still the government s plans to borrow as much as 10 billion through sovereign bonds overseas combined with optimism that both the rbi and the u s federal reserve might trim interest rates has received a thumb s up from bond markets the yield on the benchmark 10 year government bond has fallen to around 6 54 it hit 8 last year narrowing the real interest rate that is the gap with inflation which is around 3 but things are going to get worse before they get better this year s monsoon will be deficient even if banks start to lend again private investment revives and a nbfc shakeout takes place we are looking at two more years of pain will we achieve 7 gdp growth this year and vault to 8 plus in the remainder of modi 2 0 that would be the stuff of legend right now it is legerdemain

international experience in developing open economy in inland areas and the enlightenment to hubei province to seize the strategic opportunity of one belt and one road raising the level of open economy is the inevitable choice for hubei to build up the strategic fulcrum of the rise of central china this paper summarizes the successful experience of developing open economy in inland areas of foreign countries analyses the current situation and existing problems of hubei s open economy development and on this basis draws lessons from foreign experience and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions for developing open economy in hubei 1 introduction this nowadays economic globalization and regional economic integration have become two major trends in world development developing an open economy is the first choice for most developed and developing countries since the reform and opening up china s coastal areas with superior geographical environment have made unprecedented development but after decades the gap between eastern and western areas coastal and inland areas has become more and more obvious compared with the developed coastal areas the economic development and openness of inland and edgewise provinces are relatively backward therefore the demand of inland areas for expanding economic development space through opening up is more urgent than that of coastal areas the concept of one belt and one road is an innovation for china s opening up theory it complies with the need of china s opening up to regional structural transformation it means that china s opening up to the outside world will change its strategy it is a major strategic plan for china to take the initiative to cope with the profound changes in the global situation and coordinate the two overall situations at home and abroad it opened a door of opportunity to accelerate the development of hubei which has obvious regional advantages and strong comprehensive strength if hubei wants to transcend and form inland open highlands we must have new ideas and not blindly copy the coastal mode we can take the regional advantages hubei is in the middle of china and the two major national strategies the one belt and one road and the yangtze river economic belt it will be helpful for the sustainable development of hubei s open economy to learn from the experience of the open economy construction in the inland areas of foreign countries 2 literature review 2 1 research abroad the study of open economy by foreign scholars began with adam smith s absolute advantage theory and david ricardo s comparative advantage theory later economists in the field of open economy mainly focused on the impact of the opening of factors of production on a country s economy and the impact of the opening of industrial or serving products on a country s economy kawai 1994 holds that the impact of foreign direct investment on the economic growth of a region mainly depends on the overall level of economic openness in that region higher level of openness has a greater impact on the economy while lower level of openness has a smaller impact on the economy de gregorio 1991 believes that the impact of fdi on regional economic growth depends on some special conditions and many later studies are looking for these special conditions blomstrom 1992 argues that the impact of fdi on the economy of the investment region depends mainly on the overall level of economic development of the region feder 1983 has studied and analyzed the role of the export sector in promoting the economy of non export sectors after combining the new trade theory with the new growth theory most scholars believed that trade with other countries can promote the rapid economic growth of a region through technology introduction product export and international division of labor 2 2 domestic research since the 15th national congress of the communist party of china proposed to develop the open economy and further promote the opening strategy china s research on this area has begun to increase gradually the research on open economy mainly includes the discussion on the connotation the measurement and the development mode of open economy 1 on the connotation of open economy guan bai 2000 an economist believes that an open economy is a development model that takes advantage of its own advantages to actively participate in the international division of labor to drive its own rapid economic growth zhengjichang 2003 elaborated from the aspect of allocation of production factors that open economy is an economic development mode that can allow all kinds of production factors to flow freely and optimize the allocation of resources zeng zhilan 2003 believed that all the developed countries implemented the open economic development model he raised the open economic development model to the height of the economic system and it was no longer a temporary policy opening 2 on the measurement of open economy different economists in different periods have different measurement methods the most frequently used measure is the degree of dependence on foreign trade that is the proportion of total imports and exports to the gross product of the region because of its simplicity and convenience it can directly reflect the relationship between import and export trade and gdp in a region so it has been widely used for a long time li yi 1998 put forward three indicators of international trade openness international financial openness and international investment openness each of which occupies different weights and forms a complete measurement and evaluation system together then huang fanhua 2001 put forward a four in one measurement and evaluation system the four indicators are commodity trade openness service trade openness direct investment openness and indirect investment openness after that more and more indicators are used to evaluate the open economy more and more detailed and more specific xiao junfu et al 2009 put forward three first level indicators and 22 second level indicators to evaluate the open economy development of a region 3 on the path of open economic development at present there are few studies on the development path of open economy in the inland areas of central and western china most of which are about the eastern coast or the specific areas along the river guoxianguang 2003 made a thorough inquiry into the mode of introducing foreign capital in jiangsu province and going out in zhejiang province and made a thorough comparative analysis of the characteristics causes advantages and disadvantages of the two classical modes he believed that jiangsu province relied heavily on foreign direct investment and zhejiang province relied excessively on a single type of export products and he put forward corresponding countermeasures and suggestions about the deficiencies ma huiqiang et al 2014 analyzed the open economy of the coastal provinces and cities in china through the evaluation index system the results show that the open economy of coastal provinces and cities in china can be divided into four categories strong open area shanghai open area tianjin guangdong jiangsu zhejiang general open area liaoning fujian shandong weak open area hebei guangxi the coastal open economy has great regional differences and the north is lower than the south cheng jian et al 2013 believed that since the reform and opening up the inland areas have made great achievements in opening up through continuous efforts however the inland areas are also facing many difficulties in the process of open economy development the inland areas can t simply copy the experience of coastal areas they should innovate in integrating global factors restructuring world resources and creating comparative advantages so as to ensure the healthy development of the inland open economy at present there is hardly any systematic research on the open economy of hubei province 3 successful cases and experiences of open economy development in inland areas of foreign countries in the development of inland open economy abroad the development experience of chicago and bangalore india is worth learning 3 1 chicago usa located in the northeast of illinois chicago is the largest city in the midwest of the united states it is also an old industrial inland city chicago has many successful experiences in developing export oriented economy first is building regional railway transport hub more than 30 railway lines in the north central part of the united states are assembled here the total length of urban railway lines is more than 124 000 kilometers with an annual freight volume of 512 million tons it ranks first among the major cities in the world and is the largest railway hub in the united states second is focusing on developing the airborne economy chicago airport is one of the busiest airports in the world aircraft traffic passenger numbers and cargo tonnage are all in the forefront of the united states and even the world it is the largest air transportation center in the united states third is striving to build a financial center chicago has more than 300 us banks 40 branches of foreign banks and 16 insurance companies its total financial assets rank third in the federal reserve s jurisdiction it is the second largest us financial center after new york and the largest financial derivatives trading center in the world fourth is actively introducing large enterprises and groups to chicago there are 33 fortune 500 companies in the world and 47 forbes 500 companies in the united states settled here 3 2 bangalore india bangalore is a typical inland city in southern india it is an industrial and commercial center in india it is famous for its software industry and is known as the silicon valley of india software and service outsourcing industry is the most successful case of indian industrial development in the international market and it is also a typical case of world economic globalization before the 1960s bangalore mainly developed traditional industries such as steel machinery chemistry textiles leather food and so on in order to occupy a place in the division of labor in the world industry the city aims at the information service outsourcing industry which is totally free from geographical constraints promulgates preferential policies to support the development of the software industry actively participates in the global information service subcontracting and attracts software enterprises and high tech talents from all over the world at the same time the indian government has set up key national defense and communication research institutes such as the institute of scientific research the national aeronautical research institute and radar electronics development corporation in the city today bangalore software science and technology park with an area of only 1 5 square kilometers has become the world s recognized software outsourcing service base and the world s fifth largest information technology center bangalore is the first developing country to benefit from the internet era bangalore s success can be attributed to first seizing the important opportunities of international industrial transfer with the rapid development of information technology industry since the mid 1990s outsourcing of software services has risen in large numbers this industry is less restricted by geographical location so bangalore has seized the opportunity of international industry transfer by taking advantage of local talent advantages second the success is due to the background of international culture and education and science research influenced by british culture english is one of the main languages in bangalore which provides a basis for the opening up of cultural level with an international educational background it is suitable for the development of knowledge intensive industries third the supports of the government s open policy in view of the development of the information industry the indian government has adopted a series of supporting policies to create a scientific research environment and investment environment for the growth of the software industry and to provide financial support 4 current situation of open economy development in hubei province in 2017 under the correct leadership of provincial party committees and provincial governments hubei earnestly implemented the spirit of the eighteenth and nineteenth national congresses of the party adhered to the opening up pioneer strategy facing difficulties they made new achievements in opening up development 4 1 achievements of hubei s open economy development first foreign trade continues to improve in 2017 the total import and export volume reached 313 4 billion yuan an increase of 20 6 the export volume was 206 4 billion yuan an increase of 20 2 and the import volume was 107 billion yuan an increase of 21 4 in 2018 the total import and export volume reached 348 7 billion yuan an increase of 11 2 the export volume was 225 3 billion yuan an increase of 9 2 and the import volume was 123 4 billion yuan an increase of 15 second hubei vigorously promoted investment promotion the total amount of contractual foreign investment in the whole province was 8 6 billion us dollars up 157 6 the actual use of foreign investment was 11 billion us dollars up 8 5 thirteen new top 500 chinese enterprises came to hubei to invest totaling 267 third foreign investment is developing rapidly the total turnover of foreign contracted projects in the whole province reached 7 1 billion us dollars an increase of 38 4 and the newly signed contracts reached 14 9 billion us dollars an increase of 17 7 non financial fdi was 1 6 billion up 15 4 fourth hubei accelerated the construction of port platforms the number of people entering and leaving the provincial ports was 2 863 million an increase of 12 2 over the same period last year the central european railway liner wuhan has 377 rows transporting 34 000 standard boxes with a growth rate of over 60 and a loading rate of 97 7 there are 58 international and regional passenger and freight routes in the province 4 2 problems existing in hubei s open economy at present the economic situation at home and abroad is undergoing profound and complex changes our province s opening up and development is in an important strategic opportunity period with bright prospects but the challenges are also very serious lack of openness is still the biggest weakness of hubei it is mainly embodied in the following three aspects first the scale of foreign trade is small and the degree of industrial export orientation needs to be improved the gdp of our province ranks seventh in the country and the second in the central part while the import and export of goods ranks 16th in the country the import and export ranks obviously lag behind the gdp ranking which is not commensurate with the economic size of our province in the country in 2017 the national dependence on foreign trade was 33 6 while the dependence on foreign trade in our province was only 8 6 which was about 25 percentage points lower than the national level there are 17 big industries over hundred billion in our province accounting for 90 of the province s main industrial income but the export oriented degree of the industry is very low secondly the quantity and quality of foreign capital utilization in hubei are limited there are 173 overseas top 500 enterprises invested in hubei but the investment intensity is not enough in recent three years 2016 2018 the actual utilization of foreign capital in hubei province was 10 129 billion us dollars 10 094 billion us dollars and 11 941 billion us dollars respectively far behind the developed coastal provinces the structure of industrial structure and layout of foreign funded projects is unreasonable there are many general projects and resource consumption projects of short flat and fast but few projects with high technology content large industrial correlation and strong supporting capacity the group and the top 500 companies in the world are relatively few hong kong taiwan and other asian countries regions have more investment while the developed countries in europe and the united states are relatively less thirdly the construction of hubei port is relatively lagging behind and the open hardware and software environment needs to be improved there are only five main ports in the hubei section of the yangtze river which is 1062 km long there is a lack of special wharfs to meet the needs of the development of characteristic industries and products in the region the port facilities are backward the throughput is small and the navigation conditions are poor among the 6 provinces and 2 cities along the yangtze river hubei s port number and throughput capacity rank third and hubei s port throughput ranks fourth there is a big gap between hubei s port throughput and shanghai s and jiangsu s the leading role of the customs special supervision zone is not obvious enough and the trade facilitation measures such as the online supervision of electronic ports and the single window of international trade are still imperfect logistics costs are high and the benefits of trade channels such as railway lines wuhan between china and europe and the departure river port need to be further enhanced there are only four consulates general in wuhan there is a big gap compared with shanghai and guangzhou the quantity of consulates general in wuhan also lags behind chengdu chongqing and other western cities the openness of science technology education culture and tourism is insufficient the construction of market supervision rule of law and honesty environment is lagging behind there are still many bottlenecks in the development of openness in addition the lack of ideological emancipation weak awareness of openness and unsound institutional mechanisms are also important factors affecting the open development of hubei province 5 suggestions on developing hubei s open economy by using international experience for reference 5 1 perfecting the spatial pattern of hubei s open economic development improving the spatial pattern of hubei s open economic development is one of the important strategies of hubei s opening up to the outside world under the background of one belt and one road implementation considering the actual characteristics of the current economic development in hubei province and the problems of unbalanced regional economic development and inadequate degree of opening up to the west we suggest based on the opportunity of opening up economic development in hubei brought by the national multiple strategies to take the strategy of wuhan drives cities along the yangtze river to further radiate the whole province as the overall thinking of the open economic development relying on the one transverse yangtze river and one longitudinal beijing guangzhou railway comprehensive linkage one belt and one road and give full play to the advantages of hubei as a key development area of ecological economy so as to achieve the goal of improving the spatial pattern of economic opening up 5 2 speed up the construction of hubei s open economic export base from the actual situation of the present stage of open economy development in hubei province hubei s industrial development has a long history and its industrial system has gradually matured at the same time in recent years relying on its own strong scientific and educational strength it has further accelerated the speed of economic transformation and upgrading and effectively promoted mass entrepreneurship and innovation and the overall vitality of open economy development in hubei has been significantly enhanced under such circumstances hubei should speed up the construction of export infrastructure of open economy and continuously optimize the structure of economic development and trade of open economy in hubei by cultivating the dominant export base so as to effectively promote the further expansion of industrial export scale in hubei economy for example at present hubei province has six provincial export bases involving shipbuilding automobile and spare parts machinery and equipment biomedicine chemical industry and steel industry it is suggested that the above six industrial export bases should be taken as the basic carrier and on this basis a number of new export bases of advantageous industries should be cultivated and enterprises should be actively encouraged to register trademarks internationally and complete product certification and gradually highlight the brand advantage of made in hubei 5 3 vigorously promote overseas investment and accelerate the internationalization of enterprises from the perspective of promoting multi mode overseas investment in hubei s open economic development we should focus an key leading enterprises in hubei and actively encourage and support enterprises to develop in groups and further strengthen the capacity of hubei s economic development to allocate resources globally on the basis of actively participating in the construction of overseas economic and trade cooperation zones we should speed up the internationalization of large enterprises in traditional industries in hubei and promote the overseas extension or restructuring of traditional industrial chains through overseas investment or mergers and acquisitions hubei has certain advantages in the traditional industrial field we must speed up the optimization of the traditional industrial industry speed up the internationalization process of large enterprises and expand the international development space of the traditional industrial industry in hubei at the same time we should establish a sound risk prevention mechanism for overseas investment expand the scale of insurance effectively expand the large scale international projects along the one belt and one road around some key areas such as exploration design and construction and establish a cooperation mode based on the general contract project which can provide opportunities and guarantees for the export and labor export of hubei s technology equipment and raw materials 5 4 speed up the planning and construction of open platform we will further plan and build an open platform to enhance its channel functions first we should actively promote the construction of free trade zones replicate and disseminate the experience of the four approved free trade zones in an all round way and actively declare for the establishment of an experimental inland free trade zone in hubei province we should attract the agglomeration of production factors at home and abroad through highly open trade tariff and financial policies so as to make up for the scarcity of resources in the inland areas second speed up the construction of wuhan bonded zone and actively support cities with conditions to speed up the construction of bonded zone develop the foreign trade service function of wuhan export processing zone build a public bonded logistics platform for the whole vehicle and spare parts in wuhan development zone and build a big platform for wuhan automobile industry and even the automobile industry in the wuhan shiyan auto corridor of hubei province to go out third we should promote the construction of customs clearance and enhance the level of trade facilitation on the one hand we will speed up the construction of convenient window for hubei electronic ports and international trade and vigorously promote the exchange of information mutual recognition of supervision and law enforcement among port management departments on the other hand regional cooperation should be strengthened we will accelerate the reform of integration of customs clearance and inspection and quarantine in hubei s docking yangtze river economic zone comprehensively promote the one stop operation of integration of customs clearance in the yangtze river economic zone and deepen cooperation with shanghai port customs clearance explore and promote the construction of regional sharing platform of electronic ports in urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the yangtze river at the same time we should speed up the construction of logistics public information platform and specialized market trading information platform and build a fully functional foreign related logistics information network covering southeast asia central asia and europe as soon as possible 5 5 strengthening the guarantee of hubei s open economic policy strengthening the policy guarantee of hubei s open economic policy is the basic guarantee for the development of hubei s open economy under the background of one belt and one road implementation policy environment as a key factor to ensure the sustainable development of the open economic function of hubei province can effectively promote the continuous improvement of the open economic environment of hubei province through deep excavation of policy dividends while building the free trade zone of hubei province for example in the process of deepening the reform of utilizing foreign capital we should vigorously promote the negative list of foreign related investment access in hubei and at the same time increase the efforts to serve foreign funded enterprises so as to further expand the scope of economic opening up in some key industries such as new industries and modern service industries in addition we should optimize the government and business environment further improve the administrative examination and approval system eliminate unreasonable charges in an all round way and increase support for small and medium sized technology based foreign trade enterprises and independent brand export enterprises notes this paper was financially supported by innovation fund for college

international experience in developing open economy in inland areas and the enlightenment to hubei province to seize the strategic opportunity of one belt and one road raising the level of open economy is the inevitable choice for hubei to build up the strategic fulcrum of the rise of central china this paper summarizes the successful experience of developing open economy in inland areas of foreign countries analyses the current situation and existing problems of hubei s open economy development and on this basis draws lessons from foreign experience and puts forward countermeasures and suggestions for developing open economy in hubei 1 introduction this nowadays economic globalization and regional economic integration have become two major trends in world development developing an open economy is the first choice for most developed and developing countries since the reform and opening up china s coastal areas with superior geographical environment have made unprecedented development but after decades the gap between eastern and western areas coastal and inland areas has become more and more obvious compared with the developed coastal areas the economic development and openness of inland and edgewise provinces are relatively backward therefore the demand of inland areas for expanding economic development space through opening up is more urgent than that of coastal areas the concept of one belt and one road is an innovation for china s opening up theory it complies with the need of china s opening up to regional structural transformation it means that china s opening up to the outside world will change its strategy it is a major strategic plan for china to take the initiative to cope with the profound changes in the global situation and coordinate the two overall situations at home and abroad it opened a door of opportunity to accelerate the development of hubei which has obvious regional advantages and strong comprehensive strength if hubei wants to transcend and form inland open highlands we must have new ideas and not blindly copy the coastal mode we can take the regional advantages hubei is in the middle of china and the two major national strategies the one belt and one road and the yangtze river economic belt it will be helpful for the sustainable development of hubei s open economy to learn from the experience of the open economy construction in the inland areas of foreign countries 2 literature review 2 1 research abroad the study of open economy by foreign scholars began with adam smith s absolute advantage theory and david ricardo s comparative advantage theory later economists in the field of open economy mainly focused on the impact of the opening of factors of production on a country s economy and the impact of the opening of industrial or serving products on a country s economy kawai 1994 holds that the impact of foreign direct investment on the economic growth of a region mainly depends on the overall level of economic openness in that region higher level of openness has a greater impact on the economy while lower level of openness has a smaller impact on the economy de gregorio 1991 believes that the impact of fdi on regional economic growth depends on some special conditions and many later studies are looking for these special conditions blomstrom 1992 argues that the impact of fdi on the economy of the investment region depends mainly on the overall level of economic development of the region feder 1983 has studied and analyzed the role of the export sector in promoting the economy of non export sectors after combining the new trade theory with the new growth theory most scholars believed that trade with other countries can promote the rapid economic growth of a region through technology introduction product export and international division of labor 2 2 domestic research since the 15th national congress of the communist party of china proposed to develop the open economy and further promote the opening strategy china s research on this area has begun to increase gradually the research on open economy mainly includes the discussion on the connotation the measurement and the development mode of open economy 1 on the connotation of open economy guan bai 2000 an economist believes that an open economy is a development model that takes advantage of its own advantages to actively participate in the international division of labor to drive its own rapid economic growth zhengjichang 2003 elaborated from the aspect of allocation of production factors that open economy is an economic development mode that can allow all kinds of production factors to flow freely and optimize the allocation of resources zeng zhilan 2003 believed that all the developed countries implemented the open economic development model he raised the open economic development model to the height of the economic system and it was no longer a temporary policy opening 2 on the measurement of open economy different economists in different periods have different measurement methods the most frequently used measure is the degree of dependence on foreign trade that is the proportion of total imports and exports to the gross product of the region because of its simplicity and convenience it can directly reflect the relationship between import and export trade and gdp in a region so it has been widely used for a long time li yi 1998 put forward three indicators of international trade openness international financial openness and international investment openness each of which occupies different weights and forms a complete measurement and evaluation system together then huang fanhua 2001 put forward a four in one measurement and evaluation system the four indicators are commodity trade openness service trade openness direct investment openness and indirect investment openness after that more and more indicators are used to evaluate the open economy more and more detailed and more specific xiao junfu et al 2009 put forward three first level indicators and 22 second level indicators to evaluate the open economy development of a region 3 on the path of open economic development at present there are few studies on the development path of open economy in the inland areas of central and western china most of which are about the eastern coast or the specific areas along the river guoxianguang 2003 made a thorough inquiry into the mode of introducing foreign capital in jiangsu province and going out in zhejiang province and made a thorough comparative analysis of the characteristics causes advantages and disadvantages of the two classical modes he believed that jiangsu province relied heavily on foreign direct investment and zhejiang province relied excessively on a single type of export products and he put forward corresponding countermeasures and suggestions about the deficiencies ma huiqiang et al 2014 analyzed the open economy of the coastal provinces and cities in china through the evaluation index system the results show that the open economy of coastal provinces and cities in china can be divided into four categories strong open area shanghai open area tianjin guangdong jiangsu zhejiang general open area liaoning fujian shandong weak open area hebei guangxi the coastal open economy has great regional differences and the north is lower than the south cheng jian et al 2013 believed that since the reform and opening up the inland areas have made great achievements in opening up through continuous efforts however the inland areas are also facing many difficulties in the process of open economy development the inland areas can t simply copy the experience of coastal areas they should innovate in integrating global factors restructuring world resources and creating comparative advantages so as to ensure the healthy development of the inland open economy at present there is hardly any systematic research on the open economy of hubei province 3 successful cases and experiences of open economy development in inland areas of foreign countries in the development of inland open economy abroad the development experience of chicago and bangalore india is worth learning 3 1 chicago usa located in the northeast of illinois chicago is the largest city in the midwest of the united states it is also an old industrial inland city chicago has many successful experiences in developing export oriented economy first is building regional railway transport hub more than 30 railway lines in the north central part of the united states are assembled here the total length of urban railway lines is more than 124 000 kilometers with an annual freight volume of 512 million tons it ranks first among the major cities in the world and is the largest railway hub in the united states second is focusing on developing the airborne economy chicago airport is one of the busiest airports in the world aircraft traffic passenger numbers and cargo tonnage are all in the forefront of the united states and even the world it is the largest air transportation center in the united states third is striving to build a financial center chicago has more than 300 us banks 40 branches of foreign banks and 16 insurance companies its total financial assets rank third in the federal reserve s jurisdiction it is the second largest us financial center after new york and the largest financial derivatives trading center in the world fourth is actively introducing large enterprises and groups to chicago there are 33 fortune 500 companies in the world and 47 forbes 500 companies in the united states settled here 3 2 bangalore india bangalore is a typical inland city in southern india it is an industrial and commercial center in india it is famous for its software industry and is known as the silicon valley of india software and service outsourcing industry is the most successful case of indian industrial development in the international market and it is also a typical case of world economic globalization before the 1960s bangalore mainly developed traditional industries such as steel machinery chemistry textiles leather food and so on in order to occupy a place in the division of labor in the world industry the city aims at the information service outsourcing industry which is totally free from geographical constraints promulgates preferential policies to support the development of the software industry actively participates in the global information service subcontracting and attracts software enterprises and high tech talents from all over the world at the same time the indian government has set up key national defense and communication research institutes such as the institute of scientific research the national aeronautical research institute and radar electronics development corporation in the city today bangalore software science and technology park with an area of only 1 5 square kilometers has become the world s recognized software outsourcing service base and the world s fifth largest information technology center bangalore is the first developing country to benefit from the internet era bangalore s success can be attributed to first seizing the important opportunities of international industrial transfer with the rapid development of information technology industry since the mid 1990s outsourcing of software services has risen in large numbers this industry is less restricted by geographical location so bangalore has seized the opportunity of international industry transfer by taking advantage of local talent advantages second the success is due to the background of international culture and education and science research influenced by british culture english is one of the main languages in bangalore which provides a basis for the opening up of cultural level with an international educational background it is suitable for the development of knowledge intensive industries third the supports of the government s open policy in view of the development of the information industry the indian government has adopted a series of supporting policies to create a scientific research environment and investment environment for the growth of the software industry and to provide financial support 4 current situation of open economy development in hubei province in 2017 under the correct leadership of provincial party committees and provincial governments hubei earnestly implemented the spirit of the eighteenth and nineteenth national congresses of the party adhered to the opening up pioneer strategy facing difficulties they made new achievements in opening up development 4 1 achievements of hubei s open economy development first foreign trade continues to improve in 2017 the total import and export volume reached 313 4 billion yuan an increase of 20 6 the export volume was 206 4 billion yuan an increase of 20 2 and the import volume was 107 billion yuan an increase of 21 4 in 2018 the total import and export volume reached 348 7 billion yuan an increase of 11 2 the export volume was 225 3 billion yuan an increase of 9 2 and the import volume was 123 4 billion yuan an increase of 15 second hubei vigorously promoted investment promotion the total amount of contractual foreign investment in the whole province was 8 6 billion us dollars up 157 6 the actual use of foreign investment was 11 billion us dollars up 8 5 thirteen new top 500 chinese enterprises came to hubei to invest totaling 267 third foreign investment is developing rapidly the total turnover of foreign contracted projects in the whole province reached 7 1 billion us dollars an increase of 38 4 and the newly signed contracts reached 14 9 billion us dollars an increase of 17 7 non financial fdi was 1 6 billion up 15 4 fourth hubei accelerated the construction of port platforms the number of people entering and leaving the provincial ports was 2 863 million an increase of 12 2 over the same period last year the central european railway liner wuhan has 377 rows transporting 34 000 standard boxes with a growth rate of over 60 and a loading rate of 97 7 there are 58 international and regional passenger and freight routes in the province 4 2 problems existing in hubei s open economy at present the economic situation at home and abroad is undergoing profound and complex changes our province s opening up and development is in an important strategic opportunity period with bright prospects but the challenges are also very serious lack of openness is still the biggest weakness of hubei it is mainly embodied in the following three aspects first the scale of foreign trade is small and the degree of industrial export orientation needs to be improved the gdp of our province ranks seventh in the country and the second in the central part while the import and export of goods ranks 16th in the country the import and export ranks obviously lag behind the gdp ranking which is not commensurate with the economic size of our province in the country in 2017 the national dependence on foreign trade was 33 6 while the dependence on foreign trade in our province was only 8 6 which was about 25 percentage points lower than the national level there are 17 big industries over hundred billion in our province accounting for 90 of the province s main industrial income but the export oriented degree of the industry is very low secondly the quantity and quality of foreign capital utilization in hubei are limited there are 173 overseas top 500 enterprises invested in hubei but the investment intensity is not enough in recent three years 2016 2018 the actual utilization of foreign capital in hubei province was 10 129 billion us dollars 10 094 billion us dollars and 11 941 billion us dollars respectively far behind the developed coastal provinces the structure of industrial structure and layout of foreign funded projects is unreasonable there are many general projects and resource consumption projects of short flat and fast but few projects with high technology content large industrial correlation and strong supporting capacity the group and the top 500 companies in the world are relatively few hong kong taiwan and other asian countries regions have more investment while the developed countries in europe and the united states are relatively less thirdly the construction of hubei port is relatively lagging behind and the open hardware and software environment needs to be improved there are only five main ports in the hubei section of the yangtze river which is 1062 km long there is a lack of special wharfs to meet the needs of the development of characteristic industries and products in the region the port facilities are backward the throughput is small and the navigation conditions are poor among the 6 provinces and 2 cities along the yangtze river hubei s port number and throughput capacity rank third and hubei s port throughput ranks fourth there is a big gap between hubei s port throughput and shanghai s and jiangsu s the leading role of the customs special supervision zone is not obvious enough and the trade facilitation measures such as the online supervision of electronic ports and the single window of international trade are still imperfect logistics costs are high and the benefits of trade channels such as railway lines wuhan between china and europe and the departure river port need to be further enhanced there are only four consulates general in wuhan there is a big gap compared with shanghai and guangzhou the quantity of consulates general in wuhan also lags behind chengdu chongqing and other western cities the openness of science technology education culture and tourism is insufficient the construction of market supervision rule of law and honesty environment is lagging behind there are still many bottlenecks in the development of openness in addition the lack of ideological emancipation weak awareness of openness and unsound institutional mechanisms are also important factors affecting the open development of hubei province 5 suggestions on developing hubei s open economy by using international experience for reference 5 1 perfecting the spatial pattern of hubei s open economic development improving the spatial pattern of hubei s open economic development is one of the important strategies of hubei s opening up to the outside world under the background of one belt and one road implementation considering the actual characteristics of the current economic development in hubei province and the problems of unbalanced regional economic development and inadequate degree of opening up to the west we suggest based on the opportunity of opening up economic development in hubei brought by the national multiple strategies to take the strategy of wuhan drives cities along the yangtze river to further radiate the whole province as the overall thinking of the open economic development relying on the one transverse yangtze river and one longitudinal beijing guangzhou railway comprehensive linkage one belt and one road and give full play to the advantages of hubei as a key development area of ecological economy so as to achieve the goal of improving the spatial pattern of economic opening up 5 2 speed up the construction of hubei s open economic export base from the actual situation of the present stage of open economy development in hubei province hubei s industrial development has a long history and its industrial system has gradually matured at the same time in recent years relying on its own strong scientific and educational strength it has further accelerated the speed of economic transformation and upgrading and effectively promoted mass entrepreneurship and innovation and the overall vitality of open economy development in hubei has been significantly enhanced under such circumstances hubei should speed up the construction of export infrastructure of open economy and continuously optimize the structure of economic development and trade of open economy in hubei by cultivating the dominant export base so as to effectively promote the further expansion of industrial export scale in hubei economy for example at present hubei province has six provincial export bases involving shipbuilding automobile and spare parts machinery and equipment biomedicine chemical industry and steel industry it is suggested that the above six industrial export bases should be taken as the basic carrier and on this basis a number of new export bases of advantageous industries should be cultivated and enterprises should be actively encouraged to register trademarks internationally and complete product certification and gradually highlight the brand advantage of made in hubei 5 3 vigorously promote overseas investment and accelerate the internationalization of enterprises from the perspective of promoting multi mode overseas investment in hubei s open economic development we should focus an key leading enterprises in hubei and actively encourage and support enterprises to develop in groups and further strengthen the capacity of hubei s economic development to allocate resources globally on the basis of actively participating in the construction of overseas economic and trade cooperation zones we should speed up the internationalization of large enterprises in traditional industries in hubei and promote the overseas extension or restructuring of traditional industrial chains through overseas investment or mergers and acquisitions hubei has certain advantages in the traditional industrial field we must speed up the optimization of the traditional industrial industry speed up the internationalization process of large enterprises and expand the international development space of the traditional industrial industry in hubei at the same time we should establish a sound risk prevention mechanism for overseas investment expand the scale of insurance effectively expand the large scale international projects along the one belt and one road around some key areas such as exploration design and construction and establish a cooperation mode based on the general contract project which can provide opportunities and guarantees for the export and labor export of hubei s technology equipment and raw materials 5 4 speed up the planning and construction of open platform we will further plan and build an open platform to enhance its channel functions first we should actively promote the construction of free trade zones replicate and disseminate the experience of the four approved free trade zones in an all round way and actively declare for the establishment of an experimental inland free trade zone in hubei province we should attract the agglomeration of production factors at home and abroad through highly open trade tariff and financial policies so as to make up for the scarcity of resources in the inland areas second speed up the construction of wuhan bonded zone and actively support cities with conditions to speed up the construction of bonded zone develop the foreign trade service function of wuhan export processing zone build a public bonded logistics platform for the whole vehicle and spare parts in wuhan development zone and build a big platform for wuhan automobile industry and even the automobile industry in the wuhan shiyan auto corridor of hubei province to go out third we should promote the construction of customs clearance and enhance the level of trade facilitation on the one hand we will speed up the construction of convenient window for hubei electronic ports and international trade and vigorously promote the exchange of information mutual recognition of supervision and law enforcement among port management departments on the other hand regional cooperation should be strengthened we will accelerate the reform of integration of customs clearance and inspection and quarantine in hubei s docking yangtze river economic zone comprehensively promote the one stop operation of integration of customs clearance in the yangtze river economic zone and deepen cooperation with shanghai port customs clearance explore and promote the construction of regional sharing platform of electronic ports in urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the yangtze river at the same time we should speed up the construction of logistics public information platform and specialized market trading information platform and build a fully functional foreign related logistics information network covering southeast asia central asia and europe as soon as possible 5 5 strengthening the guarantee of hubei s open economic policy strengthening the policy guarantee of hubei s open economic policy is the basic guarantee for the development of hubei s open economy under the background of one belt and one road implementation policy environment as a key factor to ensure the sustainable development of the open economic function of hubei province can effectively promote the continuous improvement of the open economic environment of hubei province through deep excavation of policy dividends while building the free trade zone of hubei province for example in the process of deepening the reform of utilizing foreign capital we should vigorously promote the negative list of foreign related investment access in hubei and at the same time increase the efforts to serve foreign funded enterprises so as to further expand the scope of economic opening up in some key industries such as new industries and modern service industries in addition we should optimize the government and business environment further improve the administrative examination and approval system eliminate unreasonable charges in an all round way and increase

package of tax incentives to jumpstart economic development in distressed communities by financing local startups building small businesses or developing properties but there are also opportunities for education institutions and workforce development programs a lack of investment in distressed communities a growing body of research has revealed geographic prosperity gaps across the united states recent economic growth is concentrated in large metropolitan areas with populations of over 1 million which have experienced 72 percent of the nation s job growth since the financial crisis nearly half of the net increase in business establishments from 2007 to 2016 took place in just two cities washington d c and new york city millions of americans now live in distressed communities characterized by higher rates of poverty and lower levels of income educational attainment and workforce participation pockets of the country also struggle with higher rates of deaths of despair due to suicide drugs and alcohol symptomatic of a larger sense of lost opportunity distressed communities are home to millions of americans too many communities have become poverty traps it s no wonder that economist raj chetty has found that where children grow up matters for their economic prosperity as adults working with the u s census bureau chetty and his team at opportunity insights were able to produce an opportunity atlas that mapped the disparities neighborhood by neighborhood chetty and team found that a low income child growing up in a less poor community is more likely to climb the economic ladder than a child who spends her entire life in a low income area in 2015 the economic innovation group a bipartisan policy center launched by sean parker brought together a group of economists from across the political spectrum to discuss possible causes of these troubling trends and identify potential solutions these experts discovered that while struggling communities each faced a series of complex and interrelated challenges they shared one common barrier a lack of access to capital needed for community and economic development projects distressed communities have hopes and dreams but no one is investing in them the federal reserve found that banks now make fewer loans of less than 1 million than they did before the recession nearly 75 percent of all venture capital is invested in just three states california massachusetts and new york philanthropic support is also concentrated in a handful of areas an analysis of overall philanthropic giving revealed that alabama receives an average of 130 per capita in grantmaking below the national average of 451 and well below the new york city average of 1 966 when it comes to education the philanthropy roundtable estimates that 90 percent of k 12 giving is concentrated in urban areas the economists assembled by economic innovation group proposed designating these distressed communities opportunity zones and offering investors incentives to funnel capital into revitalization projects the concept drew the support of a bipartisan congressional coalition led by senators tim scott r sc and cory booker d nj and representatives pat tiberi r oh and ron kind d wi with a group of almost 100 cosponsors the legislation was eventually included in the broader overhaul of the tax code signed into law in 2017 how does the opportunity zone program work the program consists of two parts the first asked governors to identify up to 25 percent of their low income census tracts for certification by the u s treasury department as opportunity zones these designations last ten years and cannot be changed states territories and the district of columbia designated a total of 8 700 opportunity zones which are home to nearly 35 million americans where are the opportunity zones the second part creates a qualified opportunity fund a new investment vehicle to finance projects within opportunity zones after investors sell appreciated assets such as stocks bonds real estate or businesses they can reinvest the money gained from those sales into a qualified opportunity fund these qualified opportunity funds then invest in certain equity financed projects located in an opportunity zone including businesses property redevelopment or new construction the law offers investors three tax incentives that grow the longer the investment stays in an opportunity zone deferred payment of the federal capital gains taxes on the reinvested amount until 2026 a tax liability reduction of up to 15 percent if they hold the investment for up to seven years and no taxes on any generated gains from that investment if held for at least ten years benefits for communities and investors this approach has several strengths it offers low income communities a flexible tool to support their own local approaches to economic development some may need affordable housing while others need broadband or capital for growing businesses it also rewards patient capital investors must hold their investments in the community for at least ten years to secure all the benefits opportunity funds allow for enormous flexibility in terms of who can establish them what they invest in where they invest and whether the fund s goal is to maximize social impact or balance financial returns fund managers can be institutional banks community development finance institutions universities or impact investors funds can focus on a single city or support projects anywhere in the country unlike other economic development programs such as new markets tax credits there are no caps on the number of funds or the investment amounts that can be raised already there are at least 90 funds with nearly 30 billion pledged a number expected to grow as the treasury provides additional regulatory clarity economic innovation group estimated there are 6 trillion in unrealized capital gains that are eligible to reap the tax benefits the law provides potential drawbacks and problem areas while the opportunity zone program offers significant potential for positive impact there are several areas of risk previous placed based policies including empowerment zones enterprise communities renewal communities and promise neighborhoods have had mixed results as the california budget and policy center put it the inconclusiveness of the research exploring the connection between economic development tax incentives and community outcomes suggests that the costs of such incentives may outweigh the benefits these past efforts targeted the tax incentives on a project by project basis in an expensive cumbersome and time consuming process that discouraged many from applying the authors of the opportunity zone policy sought to remedy this by focusing the tax incentive on investors instead of projects once funds are pooled in an opportunity fund they can be invested in projects through the familiar processes and timelines used for most investments risk is also shared under this structure as investors and fund managers must identify good projects in order to make the investment pay off given the history of past policies and programs it is possible that investments may lead to gentrification displacement and inequitable development but this risk is likely localized to a handful of regions such as san francisco new york city and washington d c new research by the university of minnesota law school s institute on metropolitan opportunity found that the most common type of change over the last two decades has been not gentrification but rather poverty concentration in areas where there is a population displacement risk mayors and state policymakers can also use other financial incentives and permitting processes to help prevent displacement and encourage projects with greater social impact such as prioritizing affordable housing over a market rate condo a further critique of many placed based programs is that they result in tax giveaways for investment that would have occurred anyway investors could flock to the projects that have known deal pipelines such as real estate in the markets they know best such as major metropolitan areas instead of taking on challenging projects in struggling locales addressing this risk requires new services to help investors and project organizers find each other across the 8 700 zones one such service is the opportunity exchange which is working with several cities and states to serve as a searchable listing of projects the platform also assigns a social impact score based on the oz reporting framework developed by the u s impact investing alliance the beeck center for social impact and innovation at georgetown university and the federal reserve bank of new york expanding services like the opportunity exchange can help connect overlooked communities and high impact projects with investors even so the opportunity zones program lacks the organizational infrastructure taken for granted in the education sector there isn t something like chiefs for change for opportunity zone coordinators or the council for chief state school officers for state economic development directors thanks to the work of the economic innovation group accelerator for america and the local initiatives support corporation there are more ways for participants to share best practices but philanthropic support of capacity building organizations will be critical to the program s long term success how can opportunity zones impact education education and workforce institutions are the backbone of most communities if the goal of the opportunity zones program is to empower residents then investing in educational opportunities will deliver powerful results for future generations and future success early childhood and afterschool care high quality affordable childcare is essential to families economic stability parents ability to work and children s healthy development many distressed communities however are afterschool deserts where families have limited access to afterschool care tutoring and other enrichment programs qualified opportunity funds could be used to purchase or build new facilities or rehabilitate existing ones for providers the city of dayton ohio for example is pitching investors the chance to build a new public library and afterschool community center investments could even finance small businesses operating tutoring or early care programs elementary and secondary schools according to the 21st century school fund there are 13 536 elementary or secondary public schools located in opportunity zones on average 71 percent of students in these schools come from low income families many of these schools are also struggling likely reflecting the distressed communities they re serving greatschools provides a snapshot of school quality based on data indicators and found that the average rating for schools located in opportunity zones was 4 0 out of 10 0 compared to 5 2 for those located outside an opportunity zone school districts in these low wealth areas could tap into qualified opportunity funds to improve their buildings to deliver these modern schools developers and a school district could form a public private partnership using ground leases to transfer building ownership to private investors while leaving the local school district in control of ongoing operations the investment from a qualified opportunity fund could then finance the renovations with ownership returning to the district at the end of the term this approach can be used by district schools charter schools and private schools the 21st century school fund has also suggested that developers partner with school districts to modernize underutilized school facilities as mixed use community centers involving partners such as health facilities childcare centers libraries and even elder care service centers this approach is aligned with that of many emerging community schools which work with families students and community organizations to identify and address unmet needs developers can also incorporate new school construction into their projects for example the developers behind greenpoint landing in brooklyn new york are building 5 500 new apartments 1 400 which will be affordable along with nine acres of parks and a new public school serving preschoolers through 8th graders other cities with large development projects could embrace a similar approach there are ways to leverage these resources for adjacent needs as well rbh group is using opportunity zones to finance workforce housing for teachers in teacher villages a strategy that could be important for cities with a higher cost of living charter schools while at least 22 percent of charter schools are located in opportunity zones nearly 70 percent of opportunity zones are actually charter deserts or areas of three or more contiguous moderate to high poverty census tracts without charter elementary schools all things being equal a charter network may want to consider expansion into opportunity zones to tap into qualified opportunity funds an additional source of facilities funding that can complement other forms of financing developers can also include charters or private schools in mixed used properties built using opportunity funds starwood capital group for example announced a development in the south bronx that will be home to zeta charter school along with retail and apartment units even if charters don t receive any opportunity fund investment they can be part of a community s revitalization plan in florida charter schools can apply to be schools of hope which allows their networks to establish new charters near low performing schools governor ron desantis has proposed expanding the program to allow charters to serve students in other opportunity zones potentially bringing new education options to children in distressed areas colleges and universities nearly every governor designated opportunity zones near universities and research institutions creating the potential for commercializing research supporting technology transfer incubating student startups and expanding student housing universities can serve as important anchor institutions in facilitating community planning arizona state university and the university of delaware are already playing this role by leveraging their faculty research and convening abilities to assist communities with planning and development higher education institutions can also benefit from qualified opportunity fund investments almost half of historically black colleges and universities are located in opportunity zones some of these campuses will receive investment from a newly created 50 million opportunity fund led by renaissance equity partners the hbcu community development action coalition and calvert impact capital similar funds could be established to support projects near community colleges or other institutions for example some research has suggested that when students live on campus graduation rates tend to be higher opportunity funds could allow colleges to expand student housing to serve more students and thereby improve outcomes universities can also leverage their proximity to opportunity zones to create entrepreneurship incubators for students qualified opportunity fund investments could support building a dedicated facility and provide start up capital for the most promising ventures workforce training programs communities have to create workforce development programs to give residents the skills needed for new jobs and to attract business development from companies that require those skills governor larry hogan for example is targeting state job training funds in maryland opportunity zones workforce training providers can also benefit from qualified opportunity funds to build out services the technology apprenticeship provider kenzie academy is located in an opportunity zone in indianapolis which allows it to tap into qualified opportunity funds as part of its fundraising rounds kenzie also recently announced a partnership with hypothesis studios that will use kenzie graduates as candidates for roles at the startup organizations in hypothesis portfolio some opportunity zone businesses are even providing job training michigan based chart house energy uses investments from qualified opportunity funds to install solar panels and pass discounted energy costs to host facilities which may include schools but the company has also committed to hiring and training local residents creating a new employment pipeline and driving inclusive growth business incubators can provide workspace seed funding mentoring and training for entrepreneurs in fields like tech and advanced manufacturing in ohio the youngstown business incubator and bounce innovation hub offer places for entrepreneurs to learn more about advancing manufacturing and 3d printing in michigan projects like the detroit grocery incubator help address the problem of food deserts by supporting entrepreneurs who wish to set up local grocery stores entrepreneurs growing local businesses is an important part of addressing poverty and one of the primary objectives of the opportunity zone program according to the kauffman foundation for every 1 percent increase in the rate of new businesses started in a state there is a 2 percent decline in the poverty rate opportunity zones give investors the chance to add qualified opportunity funds to their portfolios and thereby support overlooked entrepreneurs in distressed communities hypothesis studios for example is searching for mission driven founders in opportunity zones who are trying to make an impact in sectors including healthcare technology education technology agricultural and the internet of things modeled after the famous edison labs hall labs in utah has 25 companies and employs more than 200 engineers scientists and specialists hall venture partners is launching an opportunity fund giving investors the chance to participate this same approach could be used by education investors to attract private capital to the launch and growth of education and workforce solutions it could also be used to help target underserved populations such as minority or female entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs launching their startups in an opportunity zone creates a new fundraising advantage for example the next generation assessment startup imbellus is located in the heart of a distressed opportunity zone in culver city california which means the company is eligible to receive opportunity fund investment as part of its next venture raise this additional capital would help imbellus accelerate its work developing new assessments through learning science psychometrics and artificial intelligence incubators and accelerators could also be established within a zone to help jumpstart new education businesses or nonprofits matt candler of 4 0 schools for example is exploring the use of qualified opportunity funds to develop small creativity boosting approachable spaces like microschools and maker spaces facilitating the success of opportunity zones investment is not guaranteed just because a community is designated an opportunity zone it is up to mayors community leaders and local business leaders to bring projects to investors define priorities and provide additional support only then will opportunity zones drive inclusive growth how policymakers can help mayors and governors are well positioned to identify community assets and needs by evaluating current conditions in their opportunity zones to this end the accelerator for america and new localism advisors is working with cities like cleveland ohio erie pennsylvania louisville kentucky stockton california and south bend indiana on investment prospectuses that describe local demographic and economic trends assets and anchor institutions and potential projects for investors the local initiatives support corporation has also released a playbook to help communities with their planning education and workforce institutions need to join these discussions to inform the work and potentially benefit from investment policymakers will need to leverage state support through grant preference points eligibility criteria or other state incentives to make projects in their opportunity zones more attractive for investors so far more than 150 bills addressing some or all of these policy levers have been introduced this year proposed legislation in alabama for example would provide 50 million in tax credits to impact oriented qualified opportunity funds which benefit projects in rural areas technology companies workforce training providers and affordable housing developments but state policymakers do not necessarily have to pledge new funds and in many cases can use existing state and federal dollars the u s department of education is giving competitive preference to career and technical education projects serving opportunity zones under the innovation and modernization grant program within the perkins act a federal law funding career and technical education states can follow the federal government s lead by making the opportunity zone designation an indicator of need in their own state grant programs or they can award bonus points for competitive grants allocated under the every student succeeds act these approaches allow states to encourage the types of development they want to see in opportunity zones and prioritize the projects most likely to benefit residents the role of philanthropic organizations philanthropies also have a critical role in the success of opportunity zones particularly in terms of capacity building foundations can support local planning or provide funding for a dedicated opportunity zone coordinator along these lines the rockefeller foundation announced that six cities will receive financial support for the hiring of a chief opportunity zone officer who will be embedded in a city government or a city economic development agency and two community engagement specialists the economic innovation group is also in the process of securing support for a forum where opportunity zone coordinators can exchange best practices and develop shared strategies qualified opportunity funds also give foundations another tool besides traditional grants and program related investments for education and education adjacent foundations these funds offer unique opportunities to improve student outcomes a whole child opportunity fund for example might complement school based philanthropic endeavors by investing in a new grocery store in a food desert building affordable housing for a low income community or creating dedicated space for tutoring and afterschool programs though these projects would normally be outside their grantmaking scope qualified opportunity funds let foundations address pressing needs by leveraging outside capital directed at mission aligned projects opportunities are what we make of them the opportunity zones program is the largest community development initiative in a generation but its success isn t guaranteed policymakers mayors community leaders investors developers and philanthropic organizations will have to work together to get the best results for opportunity zone residents if education leaders pursue these investment opportunities they too can benefit from the program and ensure better outcomes for those in distressed communities for generations to come john bailey is an advisor to the walton family foundation and a visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute he previously created the opportunity zone proposal announced by president bush in 2004

u s producer prices rose slightly for the second straight month in june as an acceleration in the cost of services was offset by cheaper energy goods resulting in the smallest annual increase in producer inflation in nearly 2 1 2 years the report from the labor department on friday also showed a slowdown in underlying producer prices last month a sign that overall inflation could remain moderate for a while despite strong gains in prices of some consumer goods and services in june the tepid readings also suggested that tariffs on chinese imports were not yet having an impact on inflation the low inflation environment and rising risks to the economy from the trade war between the united states and china and cooling global growth are likely to see the federal reserve cutting interest rates this month for the first time in a decade fed chairman jerome powell on wednesday told lawmakers the u s central bank would act as appropriate to protect the economy against these risks we don t anticipate any significant acceleration in inflation through the remainder of this year said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania therefore the fed can cut rates in july and then keep them unchanged through 2020 the producer price index for final demand edged up 0 1 per cent last month after a similar gain in may in the 12 months through june the ppi rose 1 7 per cent the smallest gain since january 2017 slowing from a 1 8 per cent increase in may economists polled by reuters had forecast the ppi unchanged in june and increasing 1 6 per cent on a year on year basis excluding the volatile food energy and trade services components producer prices were unchanged in june after rising 0 4 per cent for two straight months the so called core ppi increased 2 1 per cent in the 12 months through june after advancing 2 3 per cent in may the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher with the s p 500 and dow indexes hitting record highs on rate cut expectations goods prices fall the fed which has a 2 per cent inflation target tracks the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index for monetary policy the core pce price index increased 1 6 per cent year on year in may and has undershot its target this year in june wholesale energy prices fell 3 1 per cent after slipping 1 0 per cent in the prior month goods prices decreased 0 4 per cent last month after declining 0 2 per cent in may a 5 0 per cent drop in gasoline prices accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the decline in the cost of goods last month wholesale food prices rebounded 0 6 per cent in june driven by chicken eggs and fresh fruits and melons corn prices surged 19 9 per cent the largest rise since july 2015 but meat prices fell excluding food and energy goods prices were unchanged for the third straight month the prices of core goods that companies pay to produce their products are seeing no lift from the tariffs that the trump administration has put in place said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york that s not good news as it speaks volumes to the weakening demand seen in the manufacturing sector this year manufacturing is struggling under the weight of trade tensions an inventory bloat and a slowing global economy the cost of services increased 0 4 per cent in june the most since october 2018 after rising 0 3 per cent in may services were boosted by an increase in margins received by wholesalers and retailers the cost of healthcare services rose 0 2 per cent last month matching may s gain while prices for doctor visits and dental care were unchanged last month the cost of hospital care increased a solid 0 4 per cent those healthcare costs feed into the core pce price index last month s gains in wholesale healthcare prices combined with an increase in costs at the consumer level in june were seen offsetting a 1 8 per cent drop in portfolio management prices economists are forecasting the core pce price index rising 0 2 per cent in june which would lift the annual increase to 1 7 per cent june s pce price data is scheduled to be released on july 30 while core pce will likely remain around this somewhat below 2 per cent range for the next few months favorable base effects later in the year continue to imply a return to the 2 per cent target around the start of 2020 said veronica clark an economist at citigroup in new york your time is valuable have the top business headlines newsletter conveniently delivered to your inbox in the morning or evening sign up today
published friday 12 july 2019 print disqus david haggith the bears that are gathering will soon enough be picking flesh off the sun bleached bones of this market even the fed chair who usually does all he can to avoid dismal pictures and to sound optimistic is finally talking downcast about the us economy powell helps trump trade war he didn t do much but powell genuflected in trump s direction giving him a nudge where he needed it in trade powell s congressional comments today helped trump out a little with his trade deficit problem by causing the dollar to plunge in value cnbc since trump has been in office the trade deficit has widened by 25 as has the us budget deficit the trade deficit is widening because countries are importing fewer us goods and because they are lowering the value of their currency against the dollar and we measure trade in dollars as foreign currency devalues it takes fewer of those dollars to buy the same amount of goods that devaluation of foreign currencies good for us consumers but bad for us exporters because the price of their goods in foreign currencies goes up because they start out being built and priced in dollars so they sell fewer goods abroad it s also bad for us trade statistics when other nations lower their currency the lower price of goods in us dollars increases the amount of goods on the foreign side of the ledger that the us imports widening the trade deficit it turns out tariff wars are trickier than trump said they were which is partly why trump is constantly cudgeling fed chair jerome powell to lower interest as that correspondingly has the effect of devaluing the dollar on foreign exchanges as other nation s are doing it helps us in a trade war by getting into a currency war the enemy fights back as it turns out and so far the enemy is winning in terms of the trade balance sheet powell s remarks also helped trump by giving his prize badge the stock market a boost i had said in a comment on this site yesterday that i anticipated the s p would break briefly through its 3 000 barrier and it did that intraday today so that didn t take long whether it closes there having settled back beneath that level remains to be seen my comment was actually in respect to my agreement with nearly everyone else s opinion that the most likely scenario for july is that the fed will lower interest rates by 0 25 near the end of the month that i said will give stocks a brief bump not much of one because it is already price in but there is always a little halelujah dance when the moment arrives and does what it was supposed to a relief rally as the pressure of waiting and wondering is lifted then reality sets in a day or two later my most likely scenario for june and july has been that trump and xi would agree to continue talks but not get much accomplished and that powell would talk the market up and will ultimately give the 0 25 rate increase the market is demanding i ve never believed he has the courage to crash the market the worst case scenario i presented for june and july however i have said all along what happens economically in the run up to that big day and in the days after that rate cut matters more because the rate cut is already priced in that s why it s only going to deliver a bump powell aligns with me on recession though he doesn t have a clue i exist what happens during those days leading up to and after the powell put is going to be increasingly bad economic news in fact that news i ve said will press powell into delivering the rate cut that both the bond market and stock market are demanding which is why i moved some of our own money into bonds this month that news will be trouble for stocks and probably good for bonds lowering yields which makes the bonds that are already in bond funds worth more because they have higher yields money moving out of stocks could seek safe haven in bonds pressing bond yields down ever more under the new economic paradigm the fed single handedly created during its recovery regime bad economic news is good news for stocks here in wonderland because it assures more free fed funds are coming soon since free money happens quicker and easier than earning money the hard way that is currently all investors care about that is until things go so bad with the economy that there is no way to keep up the pretense that business is going along with all the falderal earnings are about to change the picture that is where powell is finally winding up just as i said he would be as july wore on he is starting at last to see the economy my way his talk shifted notably this week from past months of saying the economy was sound and expanding to sounding concerned about growing recessionary forces here are the specific concerns powell laid out most of them are concerns he is expressing for the first time powell said in prepared remarks that the inflation outlook looks muted and that the central bank will act as appropriate to sustain economic expansion cnbc in other words powell sees that deflationary pressures have returned earlier in the year he saw inflation as being above the fed s 2 0 target so he spoke in terms of a symmetric target meaning as i pointed out in one of my premium posts titled teasing out the fed s big plan for our future the fed would be aiming for inflation above 2 in what powell termed a make up strategy for the years when the fed couldn t get inflation up to save its life the fed hoped to run the economy hot powell sees that hope rapidly fading away now and that is much greater incentive for him to give that rate cut and to restart quantitative easing as i ve said for years the fed will have to do when it realizes its great recovery is failing due to its great recovery rewind balance sheet reduction good unemployment numbers especially now that they are hinting at turning the wrong way are not going to dissuade the fed from aiming to raise inflation by lowering interest rates declining inflation provides the ready excuse for powell and the boys and girls at the fed to do what stocks and bonds are both demanding in order to avoid a tantrum they do not want to be seen as being responsible for i said in earlier comments that if powell is leaning toward giving the market what it demands look for his comments to start focusing on falling inflation so that powell can say at the end of july the fed is cutting rates due to inflation rather than due to being the market s slave and trump s boy now here we have it there is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate we are carefully monitoring these developments and we will continue to assess their implications for the u s economic outlook and inflation powell said in his testimony just from this tease stocks rose and bond yields which had been rising due to stronger job numbers settled back down today all was made well as papa powell comforted his markets where the market was recently concerned that a blip up in job number might keep the fed from doling out cheap money those concerns are now assuaged my sense is that powell is more concerned about global financial conditions weak global pmis low global inflation weakening growth everywhere than he is pacified by a strong us labor market jim caron managing director of global fixed income at morgan stanley investment management wrote in an emailed statement the other growing concern powell fixed on was trade i said earlier this month trump would keep trade concerns on the fed s front burner through july even if he could solve them which he probably can t in order to extract his rate cut from powell powell is now paving a path to capitulate it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook he added powell hit the drum numerous times on both low inflation and rising trade war problems in fact he hit the trade note more times than any other thing he talked about in both his own speech and during questions and answers and he didn t just go there when democrats led him that way with questions so powell not only laid a clear path to rate cuts based on the fed s inflation mandate but also laid a path to blame the need for those cuts on the trump administration by basing growing economic troubles on trump s trade war rather than on fed monetary tightening business conditions are also declining which powell tied to trade problems and that is resulting in lowered capital investment certainly a recessionary move that has now caught powells eye too just as i ve said recessionary forces would start to do in july the central bank leader also noted that business investments across the u s have decelerated of late as worries over the economic outlook dog executives across the country finally powell noted slower growth in economies all over the world as a pressure on the us economy in all cnbc described our reserved chairman s testimony as striking a downbeat tone which perfectly sets the tone for his rate cut but it also means the rate cut will be happening as i ve been saying for months would be the case as recessionary winds in the general economy begin to blow and no matter how much good news is bad news here in wonderland no stock market has ever weathered a recession well there is now economic evidence that the outlook for the u s economy is not that great said juan perez senior currency trader at tempus inc in washington ultimately what that means is that the federal reserve will need to intervene cnbc as i ve said the dizzy stock market looks at economic weakness as hope of dope from the fed s free dispensary and it will be that for sure but what the market is completely failing to grasp is that years of fed meds boosted the market after it has already plunged into the basement it is entirely different when the fed starts down the interest rate cutting path after the end of a long expansion it is one thing to boost a market valued low because it has already collapsed and to do it as economic times are starting to recover it is another thing entirely to boost the stock market when values are at record heights and to do so as the economy is falling put your money there if you want it should be good for a bounce this month but good luck with that later in the summer as all the forces powell is now finally starting to openly fear continue to build exactly as you ve been reading about here all year as the bulls crack the corks on their champagne bottles when the fed makes it first rate cut in years at the end of july just remember how the fed s first rate cuts in 2000 and 2007 turned out the so called fed put was of little use in 2001 and 2007 when s p 500 index earnings growth fell to 0 moreover earnings growth has been slowing more rapidly than economic data suggests companies in the s p 500 index are expected to see an earnings decline in the second quarter according to factset marketwatch here s a graph i ve presented more than once as i ve built my case for a summer recession and for the fed s first increase being the perfect start to such a recession notice where the fed s first rate cuts after a long period of rate increases typically times out and how far the fed has to keep cutting before the attending recession ends you don t get nicer correlation than that maybe that will stuff the cork back in your champagne and save you from a major hangover later remember

file this feb 5 2018 file photo shows the seal of the board of governors of the united states federal reserve system in the ground at the marriner s eccles federal reserve board building in washington president donald trump says on twitter he will nominate economists christopher waller and judy shelton to fill two vacancies on the federal reserve board of governors ap photo andrew harnik file let s say you are deciding between two models of federal reserve candidates one has no fixed principles and embraces whatever is most politically expedient the other has a blind commitment to a dangerously wrong set of beliefs to borrow from hamilton i know it s lose lose but if you had to choose or maybe you don t because with judy shelton you can get both last week president trump announced plans to fill two vacant fed slots with shelton now u s executive director at the european bank for reconstruction and development and christopher waller the research director at the st louis federal reserve bank waller has kept a low profile but looks like a serious researcher and reasonable candidate the same cannot be said of shelton who appears to have deftly tricked the president into thinking she supports all his bad ideas when she actually supports different possibly even worse bad ideas shelton a denizen of the republican gold bug circuit in some ways resembles trump s two recent failed fed picks stephen moore and herman cain like them she decried monetary and fiscal stimulus even while we were on the brink of depression when a democrat happened to be president but she supports ultralow rates and shrugs off deep deficits now when the economy is much stronger and can it be coincidence a republican occupies the white house back during the obama years easy money and profligate fiscal policy were about to stoke ruinous inflation and debase the dollar shelton argued zero percent interest rates were equivalent to stealing from savers she argued that the fed should stop trying to make its supposedly favored politicians look good or inflate financial markets today she has been transformed or she wants her audience of one to believe so anyway she believes interest rates should be cut to zero the fed should support the president s agenda and the central bank should help prop up markets after all people can evolve what s striking about shelton s evolutions however is that they concur exactly with what the president wants to hear these about faces call into question whether she would safeguard the fed s political independence a feature necessary for it to function trump after all has made clear he s looking for a puppet having been disappointed that the four sitting board members he previously chose haven t done his bidding besides the flip flops shelton has demonstrated her personal loyalty with effusive praise of the president she has also pointedly mentioned multiple times that trump s mar a lago club would be a lovely place for a major international monetary conference a bretton woods for the 21st century this brings me to what her actual monetary policy views are and they re doozies there is one doctrine shelton has consistently promoted for decades including in recent public comments it s sometimes difficult for laypeople probably including the president to decipher unless you understand the sound money or dependable dollar code of the crank right wing fringe her radical vision involves replacing the fed s mandate of stable prices and maximum employment with a gold standard the gold standard is roundly rejected by economists and was abandoned ages ago worldwide for good reason gold prices are volatile a gold peg also crimps liquidity in times of crisis as it did during the great depression she also wants the rest of the world to adopt some version of the same thing resulting in either fixed exchange rates or even a single global common currency that s where bretton woods at mar a lago comes in there s a lot to say about why such a system would create more severe business cycles and more international financial contagion for now it s worth pointing out that if trump actually understood what shelton is promoting he probably never would have tapped her for the fed because it contradicts so much of what he stands for such a system would mean ceding u s sovereignty over its currency as well as tighter monetary policy and at least theoretically tighter fiscal policy too she s riding two horses at the same time says american enterprise institute fellow desmond lachman shelton has tried to reconcile her grand globalist un trumpian vision with trumpian policy goals with some skillful sleights of hand in a recent washington post op ed for instance she complained that other countries are cutting rates to manipulate their currency what trump wants to hear but proposed as a solution a new dependable dollar an unsubtle wink to her fellow gold bugs but if confirmed to the fed she might eventually have to choose a lane lackey or crank catherine rampell catherine rampell s email address is crampell washpost com follow her on twitter crampell

continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook new government data released thursday showed consumer prices rose in june from a year earlier the bump in inflation wasn t expected to give the fed reason to reconsider whether it should lower rates if necessary inflation has remained muted through much of the economy s 10 year expansion which powell has said cited as a justification for potentially lowering rates the early rally weakened by early afternoon after bond yields spiked following weak demand at an auction for 30 year treasurys that pulled bond prices lower driving the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note to 2 14 from 2 06 late wednesday a big move the markets were higher at the beginning of the day based on powell s testimony and him confirming what the futures markets have been telling us for a whole month that we were going to get a rate cut said randy frederick vice president of trading derivatives at charles schwab but then we had this treasury auction which apparently didn t go so hot the surge in bond yields marked a reversal from recent weeks when many investors funneled money into bonds and other less risky assets amid growing anxiety over the u s trade conflicts and signs of a slowing global economy the move had a swift effect on real estate stocks utilities and other high dividend stocks that lose their appeal when bond yields rise real

european commission president ursula von der leyen europe needs to improve its ability to act on behalf of its own security europe s army is already taking shape among european nations germany and france are the driving forces in defense now 25 countries have joined forces in a security initiative we call pesco europe must be able to defend itself expanding our the eu s security capabilities first means increased and coordinated investment in equipment that is modern and mutually compatible european council president charles michel european central bank president christine lagarde high representative of the union for foreign affairs security josep borrel conclusion new eu leaders have just been chosen which one did you vote for well none of course this is the eu after all decisions about who makes the policies which rule our lives aren t for the likes of us no no eu leaders are carefully selected for what they bring to the table they need to be able to enact the favoured policies such as sustainable development goals and further the ambitions like military expansionism of the corporate cartel who run the eu all to be funded by the european tax paying citizenry so who has been chosen to deliver the eu doesn t have an elected executive meaning the branch of eu government with the sole power to propose all eu legislation has absolutely technically the elected mep s could veto the appointment of ursula von der leyen but they only have one person to vote for the european council have already decided it will be ursula in 2014 mep s upset by the way commission presidents were appointed decided to elect their favoured candidate by majority the spitzenkandidaten nominee jean claude juncker was subsequently approved as commission president by majority decision of the european council this time around the technocrats who run the eu weren t falling for any of that pseudo democracy stuff again cleverly ursula didn t even stand or campaign in the recent european elections effectively blind swiping the european parliament the previous demand from mep s that this be a prerequisite for future commission presidents was completely ignored behind the closed doors of the eu decision makers they have foisted ursula upon a somewhat surprised european parliament who claim they will resist thankfully for the technocrats the european parliament is hopelessly corrupt so despite the apparent protestations the deals will be struck and her appointment is virtually a fait accompli they ve already been thrown a bone with the appointment of the socialist david maria sassoli to the parliamentary presidency who to his credit seems to be the only decent one among the whole bunch the eu have been militarising for some time as they move towards complete eu defence union by ursula is a big fan of the project she wrote so you might imagine that ursula s german defence minister role makes her an excellent choice to build the new eu military empire however that all depends upon what you consider the goals of the eu s emerging military industrial intelligence and security complex to be ursula has proven to be absolutely useless at running german defence policy and quite possibly corrupt too in january this year a german parliamentary report concluded that bunduswehr in 2016 german troops had to abandon a nato training exercise because ursula wouldn t approve the overtime from submarines and helicopters to small arms and personal protective equipment she has presided over a litany of procurement disasters in 2014 ursula appointed former mckinsey executive katrin suder as her state secretary for defence procurement her son david is also an associate of mckinsey she was in post when in an amazing coincidence the private consultancy firms mckinsey and accenture were given multimillion euro contracts to sort out the german procurement mess they had absolutely no effect whatsoever though they did hoover up a lot more of german tax payers hard earned money so perhaps a shudder will go down the spine of every european tax payer and service man and woman when they learn she recently wrote the only drawback being that dodgy calamity ursula will be in charge despite the numerous scandals that have characterised her political career ursula denies any wrongdoing she is currently under investigation by the german parliament so her appointment to europe s top job should see her promoted safely out of the way however if the purpose of eu defence union is to create an enormous funding trough from which private corporations can feast then ursula would appear to have all the necessary experience the european council eu council not to be confused with the council of europe sets the political direction of the european union nation states and elected mep s aren t considered capable of dealing with complex or sensitive issues so the eu council does this on your behalf it also appoints the head of the european central bank the eu council sets the eu s common foreign and security policy cfsp it selects the commission nominees and the high representative of the union for foreign affairs security so who better to lead discussions and policy on complex or sensitive issues than charles michel the man who oversaw the collapse of the belgium government because of the insensitive way he handled policy discussions as the belgian prime minister leading a coalition government despite warnings from his coalition partners that they would walk out if he signed the u n s migration pact he signed the u n s migration pact off they went and the coalition he led became a minority government with the stroke of his pen throwing belgium into completely unnecessary political turmoil this is the man who is now in charge of leading eu s political and security policy with an assumed non existent mandate to handle complex and sensitive issues apparently there wasn t anyone in europe better qualified for this role than charles the european central bank ecb has monetary control of the eurozone setting interest rates and most importantly doing anything it likes to protect the fundamentally flawed euro as the former managing director of the international monetary fund imf christine lagarde is a longstanding leader of the troika the eu commission ecb imf following the 2008 economic crisis a global crash largely caused by the profligacy of the private multinational banks and financial corporations to protect the euro greece ireland cyprus and portugal were all controlled by the troika huge pressure was also brought to bear on the economies of spain and italy the people faced shortages of basic goods high unemployment and low wages because the troika decided to asset strip their economies in return for christine s imf loans well someone had to pay for the failed business model of the banks and prop up the euro christine who qualified in law financial negligence a conveniently polite term for fraud in 2016 following her involvement in an extremely dodgy 403 million deal with french business man bernard tapie the best possible leader of one of the world s most powerful banks effectively the eu s foreign minister josep borrell is the man appointed by the eu council to lead on security which includes intelligence public health the environment and policing eu defence union future military deployment and oversight of the csfp so a steady hand is definitely required in 2000 borrell had to withdraw his candidacy for the spanish presidency after he was embroiled in a financial scandal with two former colleagues in 2014 josep forced to resign as head of the european university institute after it emerged he had failed to disclose a 300 000 p a consultancy conflict of interest with the energy firm abengoa last year he was fined 30 000 for insider trading by the spanish national securities market commission cnmv leading to calls for his resignation from the post of spanish foreign minister renowned for his well honed diplomatic skills speaking to journalists at the munich security conference in 2018 he said iran wants to wipe out israel nothing new about that you have to live with it when asked about u s independence celebrations he said all they americans had to do was kill four indians but apart from that it was very easy also as an expert at handling the media he recently walked out of an interview with the german public broadcaster deutsche welle after they asked him questions he didn t like artfully managing his public persona by having an unseemly row with the interviewer on camera only a few months agoprompting russia to lodge a protest and take fernando valderrama the spanish ambassador to russia to task to explain the outburst josep borrel would appear to just the kind of money grabbing belligerent loose cannon you want in charge of eu security defence and foreign policy were this the character list for a mike myers film we might anticipate fun and japes my only hope though admittedly a distant one is that these dictatorial appointments will shock a significant proportion of the remoaners into realising what it is they are trying to force the rest of us to stay signed up to a kakistocracy is government by the worst least qualified or most unscrupulous citizens in selecting their new eu leaders the eu has proven that is precisely what it is

after fed chief powell all but guaranteed a july cut things could quiet down a little next week as the agenda is dominated by economic data growth figures from china may shed light on how much damage the trade war has inflicted while in the us retail sales numbers will be among the final pieces of the puzzle before the next fed meeting inflation stats from new zealand and canada are also on tap with some uk data perhaps attracting attention as well given a scarcity of brexit news china s growth to touch three decade low despite the stimulus the world s second largest economy will release a raft of data on monday with the highlight being the gdp print for q2 economic growth is forecast to have slowed to 6 2 in yearly terms from 6 4 earlier which if confirmed would be the clearest sign yet that the trade war has really started to bite the nation s retail sales fixed asset investment and industrial production for june are all coming out as well while such a growth slowdown doesn t seem extreme at first glance one must consider that economic momentum is losing steam even despite strong stimulus both fiscal and monetary from the chinese authorities in fact a 6 2 gdp reading would constitute the weakest print in three decades implying that it could increase the pressure on policymakers to open the stimulus floodgates even wider besides the yuan these figures could also impact the australian dollar as well as risky assets like stocks us retail sales among the final pieces of the fed s easing puzzle in america retail sales on tuesday will provide the last piece of evidence on the consumer before the fed s two week quiet period begins ahead of the july 31 rate decision forecasts suggest that retail sales slowed on a monthly basis in june but remained in positive territory for a fourth straight month which would be encouraging in itself admittedly though there s not much that can stop the fed from cutting rates in july even if these numbers are stronger than expected chairman powell made it painfully clear that the fed will deliver an insurance cut even though the domestic economy doesn t seem to be in dire need of monetary stimulus yet his proactive stance is likely a signal of how aggressively the fed will react moving forward policymakers don t want to be caught behind the curve in a recession as for the dollar while it may rebound slightly ahead of july 31 as expectations for a double rate cut are priced out again the big picture remains grim global central banks are entering an easing cycle and the fed has the most firepower with which to ease that means the potential downside in the dollar is likely much greater than the euro s or the yen s as both the ecb and boj have much less scope to cut given their already negative rates british data back in the spotlight amid brexit hiatus with the conservative leadership contest not expected to conclude until july 22 brexit news are likely to remain scarce for now so uk data may come back in the limelight employment figures for may will hit the markets on tuesday before the inflation prints for june on wednesday culminating with retail sales stats on thursday mark carney the bank of england governor changed his tune lately by highlighting that trade tensions have amplified downside risks for britain his comments imply the bank may officially abandon its rate hike plans soon though that would hardly be surprising for markets which currently price in a 40 probability for a rate cut by december the pound meanwhile resumed its downtrend as both candidates hoping to become prime minister indicated they d be willing to leave the eu in october without a deal granted part of that may be political theatre echoing theresa may s famous line no deal is better than a bad deal what makes this threat more credible though and hence scary for sterling is that the tories are sinking so severely in opinion polls that their next leader may truly consider a no deal for fear of losing more support as a party if brexit is delayed again in this sense the worst may not be over for the pound perhaps the only saving grace for the currency may be further weakness in the us dollar that offsets losses in sterling new zealand inflation and australian jobs data to guide antipodeans the main event in new zealand will be the release of inflation data for q2 on tuesday the rbnz already cut rates back at its may meeting and markets are pricing in a 73 chance for another move at the august gathering so these figures will be crucial in shaping expectations in australia jobs numbers for june are due on thursday the rba also reduced rates at both of its last two meetings but appeared reluctant to signal more cuts instead officials noted that labor market developments will guide their next move which elevates the importance of the upcoming data the minutes from the latest rba meeting are also due on tuesday canadian cpis and retail sales coming up for loonie the bank of canada boc adopted a slightly more cautious tone this week noting that trade tensions are becoming a bigger threat although policymakers still maintained a neutral stance overall that could change quickly if the us china negotiations turn sour the loonie dropped but recovered quickly to touch a fresh high for 2019 the next highlight for the currency will be the inflation data for june due on wednesday retail sales for may will follow on friday while a lot will depend on trade as long as the boc fed policy divergence narrative holds the outlook for the loonie remains positive overall japanese inflation prints unlikely a game changer for yen in japan inflation numbers for june will hit the wires on friday but as usual the yen is unlikely to react much to economic data rather the haven currency may take its cue mainly from any signals in the trade talks
as wall street equity indexes broke new ground the s p 500 cleared 3000 points two days in a row and the dow jones industrial index finished above the 27 000 mark powell all but let slip that the rate cut is pre ordained trump s finger prints responding to questions from senators powell said policymakers indicated at our last meeting that we are looking at changing rates the economy is in a very good place and we want to use our tools to keep it there he said on thursday friday aest but more important was the rationale he offered with donald trump s finger prints clearly visible even as official figures showed an uptick in us inflation last month powell insisted that the link between unemployment and price pressures is getting weaker and weaker and weaker advertisement the comment is hugely significant it implies powell regrets last december s rate hike and perhaps several prior to that given they were based on the fed s belief that a us jobless rate below 4 per cent would lead to wage inflation and a rising consumer price index but by throwing the phillips curve which illustrates the theory linking falling unemployment to faster inflation under a bus powell is now directly echoing white house talking points donald trump s chief economics adviser larry kudlow even applauded new york democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez for getting powell this week to agree to her assertion that the phillips curve is no longer describing what is happening in today s economy high marks tongue only partially in his cheek kudlow pounced jay powell said well you re right that thing hasn t worked in decades now i ve got to give her high marks for that she got that out of the chairman said kudlow advertisement by the way that is my position that has been the president s position strong growth doesn t cause higher inflation and interest rates it looks like the fed is going to cut their rates while powell continues to defend the fed s independence from the white house it s clear he s swinging to their way of thinking the only sign of resistance from the fed chairman was his repeated reference this week to the negative global impact of the trump administration s trade war it was almost passive aggressive in its repetition yes you ll get your rate cut mr president but the economic damage it seeks to repair is your doing powell seemed to be telling committee members eating the seed corn advertisement around the world the trade war fear is clearly animating central bankers and some governments to loosen policy eating the seed corn is how economists at bank of america merrill lynch describe what s happening monetary and fiscal easing has helped offset the uncertainty shock from the trade war they said on thursday however this has come at a big cost instead of reloading their policy weapons policymakers have been forced to expend policy ammunition that they hoped to have for the next recessionary shock a rate cut could be the trigger for a recession rather than insurance against it michael k farr furthermore by cushioning the shock powell may well be encouraging more shocks that will require more easing to offset advertisement the biggest risk is that there will be an adverse feedback loop between the fed s attempts to support the economy and president trump s incentives to escalate the trade war if this powell put and trump call are strong enough they could create an ever escalating trade war matched by an ever lower funds rate boom bust cycle already most investors anticipate several cuts those with long memories know the fed almost never lowers rates just once since the 1960s cuts come in multiples which throws up another concern that the cuts will create a boom bust cycle rather than sustained growth my concern not prediction but concern is that a july rate cut in the face of a still healthy economy will create the exuberance and bubbles from which crashes and crises arise said washington based investment adviser michael farr advertisement rather than expecting monetary stimulus to generate more business investment it s more realistic to think that interest rate cuts will cause higher asset prices and more debt recessions are caused by financial imbalances and a rate cut could be the trigger for a recession rather than insurance against it the pivot to rate cuts is also one of the fastest reverse course manoeuvres in fed history this month s rate cut would come less than seven months after policymakers last hiked normally the gap is measured in years inflation will implicitly be allowed to accelerate above the fed s 2 per cent target if the cuts work as intended the us dollar should also weaken likely deepening growing global concern that the world is headed for a new currency war but it s the erratic nature of policy that should concern investors the most as news arrived on thursday that america s budget deficit has widened 23 per cent to us747 1 billion 1 07 trillion in the first nine months of the us fiscal year it should be clear there are serious problems brewing advertisement short term tinkering isn t enough just ask those department stores
if ever there was a policy area where president trump s actions were completely at odds with his objectives it has to be his dollar policy president trump clearly would like to have a weak dollar in order to level the international playing field and give a boost to us exporters with that goal in mind he continually harangues the chinese and the europeans for alleged exchange rate manipulation to gain an unfair competitive advantage he also keeps heaping opprobrium on federal reserve chairman jerome powell for maintaining us interest rates too high and he chastises european central bank ecb president mario draghi for keeping european interest rates too low as a tool to weaken the euro he does so knowing that relative interest rates play a major role in currency movements yet at the same time that trump tries to talk the dollar down he pursues an irresponsible budget policy and an america first trade policy that has exactly the opposite effect of keeping the dollar strong as a result over the past year while trump has huffed and puffed about the need for a weak dollar the dollar has kept appreciating in value one of the main pillars of president trump s macroeconomic policy has been the massive unfunded tax cut he signed in 2017 according to the congressional budget office that tax cut will cause the us budget deficit to balloon to around 4 25 of gdp over the next decade up from an average of below 3 of gdp over the preceding 50 years it will also cause the us public debt to rise by around 1 5 trillion over the next decade to over 90 of gdp by 2029 by choosing to allow the budget deficit to balloon at this late stage in the economic cycle and at a time that the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low trump has left the federal reserve with little option but to keep interest rates higher than they otherwise might have done in order to fulfill its inflation mandate this makes it all the more unfair that trump should now be blaming jerome powell rather than himself for the dollar s unwanted strength another main pillar of president trump s macroeconomic policy has been his relentless pursuit of an america first trade policy this has included the widespread imposition of aluminum and steel import tariffs as well as tariffs on a big part of china s exports to the united states it also has included the threat of more generalized and punitive import tariffs on china as well as a 25 import tariff on european and japanese automobiles an unfortunate yet predictable consequence of trump s america first policy has been a marked slowing in international trade growth and a generalized weakening in manufacturing activity abroad that in turn has prompted central banks abroad including the european central bank to loosen their monetary policies to respond to economies flirting with recession and with undesirably low inflation rates the fact that his america first policy might have left central banks abroad with little option but to signal lower interest rates ahead has not stopped trump from hauling these central banks over the coals for loosening their monetary policies to cheapen their currencies making this criticism all the more hypocritical is the president s repeated calls for interest rate cuts at home to provide the us economy with more monetary policy support this is all the more so the case considering that he is calling for such support at a time when the us economy is much less in need of policy support than are those economies abroad the america first policy has also contributed to the dollar s strength by sowing uncertainty in global financial markets that has had the effect of causing foreign money to flow towards the dollar in search of a safe haven against such uncertainty that in turn has bid up the dollar s value sadly the trump administration is not known as much for acknowledging its policy mistakes as it is for doubling down on failed policies that makes it all too likely that when the dollar continues to rise as a result of relative economic weakness and of unsettled financial markets abroad the trump administration will double down on its america first policy if it does so we could very well be on the way to the destructive beggar my neighbor and currency war policies of the 1930s
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s underlying consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 1 1 2 years in june amid solid gains in a range of goods and services but that did not change expectations the federal reserve would cut interest rates this month signs of a pick up in underlying inflation and a strong labor market reported by the labor department on thursday however further tempered financial market expectations of a 50 basis point cut at the end of the month and views that the fed would lower borrowing costs at least twice this year related stories a rate cut at the july 30 31 policy meeting the first in a decade is almost certain after fed chairman jerome powell on wednesday told lawmakers the u s central bank would act as appropriate to protect the economy from rising risks such as trade tensions and slowing global growth this argues against aggressive monetary stimulus from the central bank said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york fed officials are unlikely to cut interest rates more than one or two times this year no matter how badly the trump economics team wants even more stimulus to stoke the economy s engines of growth going into next year s presidential election president donald trump has repeatedly urged the fed to cut rates because

furnishings there were also increases in the cost of healthcare and rents in the 12 months through june the core cpi climbed 2 1 after advancing 2 0 in may but the overall cpi edged up 0 1 last month

weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate following june s solid increase in the core cpi fed officials will be watching to see if that translates into a rebound in both consumers and market based inflation expectations which have dropped over the past year one of the primary reasons the fed is going to cut rates is that inflation expectations have fallen so if expectations bounce back it may limit the scope of the impending easing cycle said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein in new york i think it will take a few months of data for that to happen the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies after the data while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street were mixed healthy labor market in another report on thursday

the first half of the year was excellent for investor returns with the s p 500 up 18 5 developed country equities up 15 and emerging markets up 11 says david kelly chief global strategist for j p morgan asset management in new york city this was well above the expectations we had coming into the year especially after the severe market correction in the 4th quarter of 2018 he adds ed farrington executive vice president of retirement strategies at natixis investment managers in boston speaking from the perspective of a retirement plan investor says any time there are double digit returns it is a positive if exposed to equities retirement plan participants are really pleased because their balances have gone up however the outlook for the second half of the year is not as good kelly says looking forward we are modest in our expectations he explains that stocks are starting from an expensive price to earnings pe ratio stock prices are at about 17 times expected earnings and bonds aren t cheap either and the 10 year treasury bond only pays 2 below inflation because of that plan sponsors and participants need to dampen down expectations of returns going forward he says a fear of both economists and investors is that the country is headed into another recession allianz life s quarterly market perceptions study found 48 of americans fear a major recession and 47 fear a major market crash only 31 of americans say they are comfortable with market conditions and are ready to invest in addition nearly three quarters 72 say it s important to protect retirement savings during a video conference liz ann sonders chief investment strategist charles schwab co inc said with 100 certainty we will get a recession trade is the most important needle mover to timing she said if the u s is on that path the peak will be in the first quarter of 2020 she said the trade war will offset business confidence gained by corporate tax cuts and absent a comprehensive trade deal businesses will not be reignited she also cited an inverted yield curve as a sign of an impending recession however other economists are not as certain about a recession farrington says the trade war tariffs and the slowing of global economic growth are increasing fears that a recession could happen but natixis chief strategist says there s a 30 chance in an investment strategy overview christopher hyzy chief investment officer at merrill a bank of america company says market watchers believe the u s is the late stages of the business cycle with a rising probability of a recession however he says we believe there have been a series of mini waves and we are in the early to mid stages of the fourth mini wave since the great recession our view is largely based on current economic conditions many of which are not typical of a cycle s late stages historically while farrington says natixis believes there will be positive returns in the next six months still there are storm clouds on the horizon that may cause some trepidation robert c doll chief equity strategist and senior portfolio manager at nuveen in bob doll s 10 predictions for 2019 2q update says we are in unbelievable cross currents with investors trying to figure things out during the schwab video conference brett wander cfa chief investment officer of fixed income charles schwab investment management inc said the federal reserve will meet at the end of july and the last thing it wants to do is have market pricing one thing and do something else in 80 out of 80 meetings the fed has done what the market is doing so a rate cut is possible he said adding that he expects three by the end of the year for this reason wander said using fixed income to offset risk in equities may not be what investors want to do but kathy jones chief fixed income strategist schwab center for financial research said if the stock market goes into a correction treasuries are investors best bet they should have some duration but also be high quality farrington says retirement plan sponsors and advisers know there s always a bump in road sometimes it s not something we hear in the news every day that causes volatility it s something not on the radar screen he says hyzy offers some examples in his investment strategy overview a potential drop in business confidence could lead to lower job growth and ultimately lower consumer confidence and spending if consumer spending pulls back then the need for liquidity may rise he adds that at that point any areas with very high exposure to illiquid assets or an excessive need for financing could have liquidity issues another item of risk not widely discussed hyzy offers is the weight of deflation deflationary risks in many cases are more difficult to turn around than inflationary risks this is where companies have less pricing power which could lead to anemic financial institutions around the world a drop in lending velocity a sharp rise in savings productive capital exiting the broader economy and the potential for a negative feedback loop a self reinforcing system so to speak with these factors potentially driving a further reduction in inflation he says actions for db and dc plan sponsors kelly says defined benefit db plan sponsors are constrained by their own investment policy to match liabilities the problem is when interest rates fall liabilities are expensive and the presumption of lower interest rates makes the problem more serious the major thing db plans can do is increase exposure to international equities they are cheaper than u s stocks selling at about 79 of the pe ratio and they will give better returns because of that beyond that db plans have to be realistic about returns being low going forward u s stocks around 3 and u s bonds around 2 if that doesn t give db plan sponsors a chance of matching liabilities they have to think about putting more money into the fund he says every db plan is unique farrington says the funded status of the plan will often determine the investment mix that s appropriate the ideal scenario is the plan is fully funded and can look at a more conservative investment approach to maintain that however globally there are many markets where the bond yield is negative the extremely low rate environment forces db investors to look at investments that are not bonds he says doll suggests portfolios include companies that benefit from the economic cycle and show they are reinvesting in their business he also suggests looking into companies with extras to offer such as a new product with the ability to raise prices in contrast to kelly he suggests investing in companies with most of their business in the u s and to be underweight in international companies for defined contribution dc plan sponsors communications is the place to focus the message should never be to time the market for dc participants kelly says constantly switching investments hurts people however kelly does suggest that plan sponsors should point out to participants that if they have a lot of money in stable value and cash they are paying more now and since the fed is expected to cut interest rates participants shouldn t regard cash as a long term investment what s critical is we live in a world of short termism and new cycles defined in 12 or 24 hour chunks of time farrington says but a retirement plan is for the long term so participants need to be reminded that their time horizon is defined in decades he also suggests that plan sponsors remind participants that the choices are very artfully put into the plan s investment menu so much goes into making the choices participants should be told the investments were chosen for their best interest and they should let short term results derail their strategies history is a great friend when it comes to communicating to plan participants farrington adds i often remind myself that my job keeps me focused on the stock markets but most people are focused on their own jobs he says it is important to communicate historical lessons to dc plan participants a great one comes from the 2008 09 financial crisis some dc plan balances went down 35 to 40 and participants may have panicked and moved to safer strategies when in fact the next year markets went up significantly he says especially equities will experience ups and downs but history tells us the return trade off is favorable historical lessons help people stay patient one final note farrington makes is that where both performance and demand are starting to find common ground is in environmental social and governance esg investments we ve seen a growing demand from plan participants for more esg and at the very same time there is an emerging body of evidence that companies with strong esg profiles are stronger and more stable he says when plan sponsors think about the volatility expected in the second half of the year esg is a consideration due to its strong investment profile in uncertain markets participants may be on to something

if ever there was a policy area where president trump s actions were completely at odds with his objectives it has to be his dollar policy president trump clearly would like to have a weak dollar in order to level the international playing field and give a boost to u s exporters with that goal in mind he continually harangues the chinese and the europeans for alleged exchange rate manipulation to gain an unfair competitive advantage he also keeps heaping opprobrium on federal reserve chairman jerome powell for maintaining u s interest rates too high and he chastises european central bank ecb president mario draghi for keeping european interest rates too low as a tool to weaken the euro he does so knowing that relative interest rates play a major role in currency movements yet at the same time that trump tries to talk the dollar down he pursues an irresponsible budget policy and an america first trade policy that has exactly the opposite effect of keeping the dollar strong as a result over the past year while trump has huffed and puffed about the need for a weak dollar the dollar has kept appreciating in value one of the main pillars of president trump s macroeconomic policy has been the massive unfunded tax cut he signed in 2017 according to the congressional budget office that tax cut will cause the u s budget deficit to balloon to around 4 25 percent of gdp over the next decade up from an average of below 3 percent of gdp over the preceding 50 years it will also cause the u s public debt to rise by around 1 5 trillion over the next decade to over 90 percent of gdp by 2029 by choosing to allow the budget deficit to balloon at this late stage in the economic cycle and at a time that the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low trump has left the federal reserve with little option but to keep interest rates higher than they otherwise might have done in order to fulfill its inflation mandate this makes it all the more unfair that trump should now be blaming jerome powell rather than himself for the dollar s unwanted strength another main pillar of president trump s macroeconomic policy has been his relentless pursuit of an america first trade policy this has included the widespread imposition of aluminum and steel import tariffs as well as tariffs on a big part of china s exports to the united states it also has included the threat of more generalized and punitive import tariffs on china as well as a 25 percent import tariff on european and japanese automobiles an unfortunate yet predictable consequence of trump s america first policy has been a marked slowing in international trade growth and a generalized weakening in manufacturing activity abroad that in turn has prompted central banks abroad including the european central bank to loosen their monetary policies to respond to economies flirting with recession and with undesirably low inflation rates the fact that his america first policy might have left central banks abroad with little option but to signal lower interest rates ahead has not stopped trump from hauling these central banks over the coals for loosening their monetary policies to cheapen their currencies making this criticism all the more hypocritical is the president s repeated calls for interest rate cuts at home to provide the u s economy with more monetary policy support this is all the more so the case considering that he is calling for such support at a time when the u s economy is much less in need of policy support than are those economies abroad the america first policy has also contributed to the dollar s strength by sowing uncertainty in global financial markets that has had the effect of causing foreign money to flow towards the dollar in search of a safe haven against such uncertainty that in turn has bid up the dollar s value sadly the trump administration is not known as much for acknowledging its policy mistakes as it is for doubling down on failed policies that makes it all too likely that when the dollar continues to rise as a result of relative economic weakness and of unsettled financial markets abroad the trump administration will double down on its america first policy if it does so we could very well be on the way to the destructive beggar my neighbor and currency war policies of the 1930s desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney

alienating production to an approach that challenged social reality from the perspective of its consumption and crucially as cultural critique it conceives of social relations in interpersonal terms in terms of manipulation of conning of managed consent the impersonal forces of the older marxist critique become personalised they are transfigured as the forces of manipulators hidden persuaders in short bad guys they re the advertisers the corporations the organisations the result is a moment in which subjectivity culture is fetishised which in turn results in a mode of theorising in which subjectivity is pacified it becomes something that is shaped by external forces of production which consumes what it is fed by an alien power hence subjectivity is celebrated at the same as its celebrants claim it is administered and controlled stupefied by the automobile hi fi set split level home kitchen equipment marcuse named and interpellated by a ruling ideology althusser and captured by the culture industry adorno a left wing social critique which might once have dived deep into the contradictory processes by which reality is produced becomes superficial concentrating on the way in which we are determined by our consumption of media of adverts of ideas during the 1970s this latent conspiracy theory even becomes a paranoid fantasy one consumed ironically by those allegedly manipulated masses themselves in a cycle of films in which society is depicted as being controlled by corrupt economic and political elites think klute 1971 executive action 1973 chinatown 1974 the parallax view 1974 all the president s men 1976 and network 1976 conspiracism goes global the theoretical and practical abandonment of the sphere of production in favour of that of consumption a movement signalled by the shift away from an economic towards a cultural critique does not necessarily result in leftist conspiracism conspiracism becomes more pronounced through the inclusion of other forms of cultural politics too from the concern with identity and recognition to the new labour ish politics of behaviour however what the cultural turn of the 1960s and 1970s does is lay the ground for a form of leftist conspiracism in which the subject seen apart from its economic activity becomes the victim of shadowy forces beyond its control after the defeats of the organised working class during the 1980s and the fall of the soviet union the conspiracist moment fully arrives and it does so most notably in the anti globalisation movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s and its occupy revival in 2011 journalist and activist naomi klein is a significant figure here her no logo taking aim at the brand bullies 1999 an evocative essay on consumer activism provided the theoretical mood music to an era punctuated by the anti wto protests in seattle in 1999 and the carnivals against capitalism of the early 2000s in the spirit of earlier new left theorists the anti globalisation movement addressed itself to the seeming colonisation of every aspect of life by the corporations no cultural nook or cranny was out of their grasp it suggested as a treatise it had the aura of profundity hinting at some more authentic life beyond the brand in style it even had the appearance of an economic critique couched as it was in terms of anti capitalism but in substance it was conspiracist conjuring up a set of corporations aided and abetted by the world trade organisation as the source of our collective inauthenticity our unreality our unfreedom in her 2002 collection fences and windows dispatches from the front line klein s conspiracism starts to come out more explicitly globalisation starts to reveal itself as a global conspiracy every local problem she writes from food security in europe to the rise of hiv in africa is the effect of a global ideology one enforced by national politicians but conceived of centrally by a handful of corporate interests and international institutions including the world trade organisation the international monetary fund and the world bank 4 this depthless insight forms the basis for the fully fledged capitalism as conspiracy schtick of shock doctrine the rise of disaster capitalism 2007 in which she contends that a neoliberal clique acting out the dreams of milton friedman use disasters and crises in former colonies and elsewhere to leverage loans in return for mass privatisations tax cuts for the rich and public spending cuts for the rest it sounds almost economic almost like an objective analysis it talks of economic policy of high finance of profit but it has no depth no penetration no genuine theoretical movement from appearance to essence instead it sticks at the level of how things appear and reduces relations of production and so on to interpersonal relations to relations between individuals between brand bullies and dupes between a set of baddies and those to whom they re doing bad things capitalism is not a mode of production anymore it is a plot a get rich quick scheme klein was only the most high profile of the new left wing conspiracists there were others too such as kalle lasn the founder and editor of adbusters who set out like klein to challenge through subversion the branded colonisation of our lives before his conspiracism like klein s broke out into the open in the mid 2000s as brendan o neill reminds us this culminated in lasn publishing his infamous 2004 list of neoconservatives intent on advancing the us as a hyper power around the world complete with an asterisk next to their names if they were jewish
pusillanimous powell was at it again today on capitol hill pivoting wildly as he took care to signal that a rate cut is still on track for the july meeting never mind though that by his lights the economy is in a good place the unemployment rate is close to it s lowest level in 50 years and job openings are plentiful given all those good things on the economy front and also that the fed held the money market rate below the inflation rate for 10 years running between april 2008 and october 2019 you d think that perhaps finally the us economy could shed its fed supplied training wheels and get along without monetary stimulus for at least a few quarters but no the nation s monetary central planner in chief espied some risks and crosscurrents that warrant vigilance and that have strengthened the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy the latter phrase of course is code for a rate cut as outlined in the chairman s written statement these risks boil down to inflation running below target trade war uncertainty a slowing global economy and weakening business confidence and investment rates peak trump the undrai david a stockman best price 12 72 buy new 43 07 as of 11 40 utc details but here s the thing the fed can t do a damn thing about any of those factors and most certainly the wet monetary noodle of a 25 or even 75 basis point cut in the administered policy rate over the next few quarters is not going to move the needle at all of course the needle actually uppermost in the fed s mind is the hourly position of the s p 500 index still the spuriousness of the above economy based rationalizations is surely a reminder of how very dangerous our monetary politburo has actually become the fed heads are literally making it up by the week day and hour as they scramble to keep the everything bubble aloft perhaps partly explaining why powell came off today sounding like the whirling dervish of money for instance consider the low flation excuse as the following passage indicates the fed s inflation targeting timeframe has either shrunk to just a few months or powell was just jabbering to keep rate cut hopes alive until some additional incoming data like last friday s allegedly blowout jobs report gives the fed an excuse to back off however inflation has been running below the federal open market committee s fomc symmetric 2 percent objective after running close to our 2 percent objective over much of last year overall consumer price inflation measured by the 12 month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce declined earlier this year and stood at 1 5 percent in may the 12 month change in core pce inflation which excludes food and energy prices and tends to be a better indicator of future inflation has also come down this year and was 1 6 percent in may well if you want to look at the very short term core pce deflator here it is during the last 20 months the annualized run rate has been at or above 2 00 on 13 occasions and in between it has been all over the lot moreover during the last two months it has posted at a 3 00 and 2 30 annualized rate respectively this suggests if anything that the short run inflation momentum is heading higher not lower so whatever caused the core pce deflator rate to swoon during q1 earlier this year has apparently vamoosed the short term trend is now actually back above the 2 01 average posted for september december of last year to be sure the very idea that the fed should adjust its policy rate or other tools in response to extremely short run blips in the inflation metric even of the holy grail of the core pce deflator is ridiculous as a conceptual matter but even empirically speaking how would they know whether to bob the lever up or weave the lever down based on the 20 monthly readings below there is in fact absolutely nothing in this chart that says it was time to raise rates in 2017 2018 but urgent to cut them now nor does a slightly longer year over year time frame like powell cited above make any difference to say that the 12 month rate of inflation shortfall is currently worrisome is to ignore what has happened three times since 2011 namely short run anomalies quickly wash out of the year year rate of change and what appears to be a swooning trend reverses into a rising trend indeed the chart above shows unusually low readings for june and august of 2018 meaning that the y y rate is about to get a big lift from a low prior year base effect during the next three monthly readings by the time the july and september fomc meetings they actually get around to cutting rates in fact the low flation risk is likely to have washed out of the very metric which powell cited in today s testimony they will likely be easing right into the jaws of 2 00 on the core pce deflator when you look at the charts since the eve of donald in october 2016 in fact you wonder exactly what all the low flation gumming is actually about at the former date the pce deflator less food and energy stood at 106 37 and in may 2019 it had risen to 111 60 that s a 4 5 gain which computes out to 1 80 at an annual rate isn t that close enough for government work well unless you are clairvoyant and already know that readings will be significantly lower during the next 12 months but clairvoyant of course the fed heads most definitely are not there is a far larger point however with respect to the fed s efficacy to wit even if second decimal place shortfalls from the 2 00 inflation target made any difference to growth and prosperity which they manifestly do not it would be absolutely impossible for the fed to close such trivial gaps anyway thus since the fed adopted formal inflation targeting in january 2012 the pce deflator less food and energy has risen at a 1 55 annual rate yet when you disaggregate the index it is clear that there are three distinct components and that all three of them are well beyond the fed s policy reach in the chart below the brown line represents the domestic services component housing education medical transportation finance personal services etc of the pce deflator it has risen at a 2 3 annual rate without fail during the past seven years while the durable goods component dark green line has steadily fallen just as consistently at a negative 1 2 annualized rate accordingly the nondurable goods component has been the tie breaker so to speak that is the overall pce deflator has mainly oscillated within a 1 5 to 2 0 per annum band depending upon short run fluctuations in the items foods energy and other commodity prices which dominate nondurable goods so here is why the fed can t manage the inflation rate symbolically speaking the negative trend in durable goods is the china price at work it represents cheap labor being mobilized from the rice paddies and villages of asia into modern factories built with sub economic debt capital the fed can do absolutely nothing about that except perhaps to recognize that it actually exports financial repression to the rest of the world that is to keep their exports competitive mercantilist minded governments and central banks deliberately neutralize the fed s flood of weak dollars by printing even more of their own currencies this has made factory capital cheap and plentiful in the rest of the world thereby keeping globally traded goods prices low even deflationary most ordinary people of course would say this is a good thing for american consumers but not the fed heads who see the world through their keynesian beer goggles the seven years of steadily falling durables inflation tracked by the dark green line below is the main reason for the shortfall in the aggregate pce deflator so either the fed means to cancel a boon to consumers or it intends to pump up the aggregate pce deflator with even more inflation in services and nondurables that is to say apparently 2 5 services inflation year in and year out is not enough punishment for the overwhelming share of us households which are already reeling from soaring education medical and housing costs the fed would apparently like to see services inflation in the 3 4 zone in order to insure that their overall 2 00 symmetrical target is delivered to the second decimal point actually the wide and persistent gap between the brown line services and the dark green line durables in the chart below makes a mockery of the entire inflation targeting folly of our present day monetary politburo on the one hand deflation is supposed to be really really bad because it allegedly causes consumers to stop buying today waiting for even lower prices tomorrow but that s just ridiculous based on the dark green line below spending for durables would have collapsed long ago which most assuredly it has not indeed since november 2014 apparel prices have dropped by 3 5 footwear by 4 0 information tech products by 11 personal computers by 23 and toys by 33 but take it from amazon or walmart or target there has been no buyers strike spending on these items is at all time highs at the same time the only way the fed could stimulate more services inflation beyond the uncomfortable levels already being measured is by causing households to borrow even more than the 15 6 trillion they already owe so that they can buy more health care education services or housing thereby pushing up prices from existing suppliers then again when it comes to housing mortgage rates are not even in the inflation indices anymore they were taken out in the early 1980s what s in the index for housing is mainly a theoretical construct called owners equivalent rent that s a made up guesstimate from bls surveys i e what would you rent your castle for if you didn t have to live there that has no relationship to interest rates whatsoever likewise we seriously doubt that lower interest rates would cause consumers to purchase even more health care that they can t afford and don t need nor is there any apparent relationship at all between interest rates and tuition day care or the other items under the education services heading yes we know that inflation is supposedly everywhere and always a monetary phenomena according to uncle milton friedman but that s just the point it s global and the pathways of transmission are far too opaque intricate and meandering to be fiddled by a crude instrument like the fed s administered policy rate see part 2 and that s true in spades for the purple line nondurables in the chart below the latter is driven in the intermediate term by global commodity stocking and destocking cycles opec supply machinations droughts and pestilence and increasingly of late by the herky jerky credit impulses emanating from the red ponzi as we have repeatedly demonstrated in short there is no proof whatsoever that 2 00 inflation is better than the 1 55 per annum increase in the core pce deflator that has actually been recorded since inflation targeting was adopted in january 2012 even then in today s global economy the fomc has virtually no tools to close the gap anyway while the low flation case for a rate cut is exceedingly threadbare the other reasons cited by powell today are even more specious that is powell is essentially suggesting that the fed has declared itself to be the global broom and shovel brigade traveling behind the moveable circus of politicians and policy makers it has taken on the mission of cleaning up their droppings whether large or small in order that their follies may not impinge on the us gdp growth rate apparently to the decimal point brexit the donald s insane trade war the next partisan food fight over the debt ceiling the great deformation david a stockman best price 2 00 buy new 9 95 as of 09 55 utc details this is complete insanity and represents the epitome of institutional arrogance and mission creep among the unelected monetary politburo domiciled in the eccles building our baseline outlook is for economic growth to remain solid labor markets to stay strong and inflation to move back up over time to the committee s 2 percent objective however uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months in particular economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies and that weakness could affect the u s economy moreover a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved including trade developments the federal debt ceiling and brexit in part 2 we will address these matters further but suffice it to recall this every excuse and rationalization for easing which emanates from pusillanimous powell and his posse is simply a cover story for the fact that they are hostage to a massive and dangerous wall street bubble that they are desperately attempting to keep afloat yet what they are self evidently doing is adding kerosene to the fire insuring that the ultimate explosion will be all the more devastating for want of proof as to the central bank fostered madness being fueled even here and now consider today s revelation that there are now 14 junk bond issues in the eurozone trading

after fed chief powell all but guaranteed a july cut things could quiet down a little next week as the agenda is dominated by economic data growth figures from china may shed light on how much damage the trade war has inflicted while in the us retail sales numbers will be among the final pieces of the puzzle before the next fed meeting inflation stats from new zealand and canada are also on tap with some uk data perhaps attracting attention as well given a scarcity of brexit news china s growth to touch three decade low despite the stimulus the world s second largest economy will release a raft of data on monday with the highlight being the gdp print for q2 economic growth is forecast to have slowed to 6 2 in yearly terms from 6 4 earlier which if confirmed would be the clearest sign yet that the trade war has really started to bite the nation s retail sales fixed asset investment and industrial production for june are all coming out as well while such a growth slowdown doesn t seem extreme at first glance one must consider that economic momentum is losing steam even despite strong stimulus both fiscal and monetary from the chinese authorities in fact a 6 2 gdp reading would constitute the weakest print in three decades implying that it could increase the pressure on policymakers to open the stimulus floodgates even wider besides the yuan these figures could also impact the australian dollar as well as risky assets like stocks us retail sales among the final pieces of the fed s easing puzzle in america retail sales on tuesday will provide the last piece of evidence on the consumer before the fed s two week quiet period begins ahead of the july 31 rate decision forecasts suggest that retail sales slowed on a monthly basis in june but remained in positive territory for a fourth straight month which would be encouraging in itself admittedly though there s not much that can stop the fed from cutting rates in july even if these numbers are stronger than expected chairman powell made it painfully clear that the fed will deliver an insurance cut even though the domestic economy doesn t seem to be in dire need of monetary stimulus yet his proactive stance is likely a signal of how aggressively the fed will react moving forward policymakers don t want to be caught behind the curve in a recession as for the dollar while it may rebound slightly ahead of july 31 as expectations for a double rate cut are priced out again the big picture remains grim global central banks are entering an easing cycle and the fed has the most firepower with which to ease that means the potential downside in the dollar is likely much greater than the euro s or the yen s as both the ecb and boj have much less scope to cut given their already negative rates british data back in the spotlight amid brexit hiatus with the conservative leadership contest not expected to conclude until july 22 brexit news are likely to remain scarce for now so uk data may come back in the limelight employment figures for may will hit the markets on tuesday before the inflation prints for june on wednesday culminating with retail sales stats on thursday mark carney the bank of england governor changed his tune lately by highlighting that trade tensions have amplified downside risks for britain his comments imply the bank may officially abandon its rate hike plans soon though that would hardly be surprising for markets which currently price in a 40 probability for a rate cut by december the pound meanwhile resumed its downtrend as both candidates hoping to become prime minister indicated they d be willing to leave the eu in october without a deal granted part of that may be political theatre echoing theresa may s famous line no deal is better than a bad deal what makes this threat more credible though and hence scary for sterling is that the tories are sinking so severely in opinion polls that their next leader may truly consider a no deal for fear of losing more support as a party if brexit is delayed again in this sense the worst may not be over for the pound perhaps the only saving grace for the currency may be further weakness in the us dollar that offsets losses in sterling new zealand inflation and australian jobs data to guide antipodeans the main event in new zealand will be the release of inflation data for q2 on tuesday the rbnz already cut rates back at its may meeting and markets are pricing in a 73 chance for another move at the august gathering so these figures will be crucial in shaping expectations in australia jobs numbers for june are due on thursday the rba also reduced rates at both of its last two meetings but appeared reluctant to signal more cuts instead officials noted that labor market developments will guide their next move which elevates the importance of the upcoming data the minutes from the latest rba meeting are also due on tuesday canadian cpis and retail sales coming up for loonie the bank of canada boc adopted a slightly more cautious tone this week noting that trade tensions are becoming a bigger threat although policymakers still maintained a neutral stance overall that could change quickly if the us china negotiations turn sour the loonie dropped but recovered quickly to touch a fresh high for 2019 the next highlight for the currency will be the inflation data for june due on wednesday retail sales for may will follow on friday while a lot will depend on trade as long as the boc fed policy divergence narrative holds the outlook for the loonie remains positive overall japanese inflation prints unlikely a game changer for yen in japan inflation numbers for june will hit the wires on friday but as usual the yen is unlikely to react much to economic data rather the haven currency may take its cue mainly from any signals in the trade talks
monaca pa if you want a sense of the challenges democrats face in 2022 s house races look no further than two districts that share a common border in western pennsylvania pennsylvania s 12th district which includes pittsburgh as well as suburbs to the east and south looks to be solidly democratic a deep blue stronghold the district is home to democratic candidate summer lee who has built her campaign around environmental justice and income inequality the state s 17th district which holds some of pittsburgh s suburbs and all of rural exurban beaver county looks much more like a toss up the district is home to democratic candidate chris deluzio who focuses on his veteran status and his work to help unionize the university of pittsburgh s faculty both districts include parts of allegheny county the home of pittsburgh but the two offer very different terrains for democrats not long ago this entire area was democratic in the 2000 presidential race democrat al gore carried allegheny county by 16 points while carrying beaver by 9 points but 2020 showed how the map had changed joe biden carried allegheny by 20 points but donald trump carried beaver by 18 points what happened pittsburgh still considered the steel city by many americans has morphed into a medical and tech center about 43 percent of the 25 and over population has a bachelor s degree but many of the suburbs around the city like those in beaver are still rooted in the area s industrial past about 26 percent of adults in beaver have a bachelor s degree the emerging differences are clear to see on the ground last week in pittsburgh we met with jasiri x the co founder and ceo of 1hood a community organizing group in the city his concern is whether democrats are doing enough on the issues that black voters face on a day to day basis 2018 was this very pivotal year for pittsburgh he said we had a very high profile police killing of a young man named antwon rose we also had the tree of life massacre later on that year it began to be like ok well protesting by itself isn t enough he continued can we move to come together to actually create and change laws he says that these voters haven t seen the return on their investment and want democrats to push harder on progressive policies instead of being passive an hour drive away from the city in the far northern reaches of the northwestern pittsburgh suburbs the united steelworkers local 1016 held a meeting in wheatland pennsylvania there we heard a very different message of what the country needs trump s new brand of union workers were more worried about issues like the emerging supreme court decision on abortion united steelworkers district 10 director bernie hall studied his crowd of union leaders closely taking stock of what political questions arose a biden voter himself he was worried about candidates increasingly going to extremes if the supreme court can overturn a law like roe v wade from 1973 what about the 1935 wagner act that said employees have a right to establish a union we ll have dozens of these across the state he said i m concerned that people aren t getting facts in general not only about president biden but just about the political process and issues that face our country in aliquippa after the local steel mill shut down nature is slowly reclaiming empty homes and many of residents of this hard hit african american community are well beneath the poverty line aliquippa mayor dwan walker d urged democrats to unite the rural voters and urban progressives the way forward in western pennsylvania he says is to remind people the area is the birthplace of the unions there s 72 000 democrats light blue he said but they ll vote republican just based off the message the message just has to be claimed
china also offered low interest loans after pro democracy rioters destroyed much of downtown nuku alofa in 2006 and analysts say those loans could prove tonga s undoing the country of 106 000 people owes some 108 million to china s export import bank equivalent to about 25 of gdp the us ambassador to australia arthur culvahouse jnr calls china s lending in the pacific payday loan diplomacy the money looks attractive and easy upfront but you better read the fine print he said china s ambassador to tonga wang baodong said china was the only country willing to step up to help tonga during its time of need graeme smith a specialist in chinese investment in the pacific is not convinced china tried to trap tonga in debt saying its own financial mismanagement is as much to blame fisherman and former politician teisina fuko thinks tonga is china s stepping stone into the pacific ap advertisement nonetheless he said it s worrying that the nation of 171 islands already vulnerable to costly natural disasters has little ability to repay why is china pouring money into tonga teisina fuko a 69 year old former parliament member suspects china finds his country s location useful i think tonga is maybe a window to the western side he said because it s easy to get here and look into new zealand australia it s a stepping stone he said for decades the south pacific was considered the somewhat sleepy backyard of australia new zealand and the united states now as china exerts increasing influence western allies are responding advertisement experts say there hasn t been this level of geopolitical competition in the region since the us and japan were bombing each other s occupied atolls we haven t seen anything like this since world war ii said smith a research fellow at australian national university after cyclone gita destroyed tonga s historic parliament house last year the government first suggested china might like to pay to rebuild it then australia and new zealand stepped in and are now considering jointly funding the project elsewhere in the region australia is redeveloping a papua new guinea naval base while new zealand has announced it will spend an extra 500 million on overseas aid over four years with most of it directed at south pacific nations rory medcalf the head of the national security college at australian national university said the area could provide a security bridgehead for china s navy which currently must sail through the us friendly islands of japan taiwan and the philippines to get to the pacific advertisement other possible explanations medcalf said include the region s fisheries seabed minerals and other natural resources as well as china s ongoing effort to lure away the few remaining countries that recognise taiwan instead of china several of them pacific island nations it s not entirely clear what china wants in the south pacific medcalf said it s just clear that china is becoming very active and making its presence felt china has poured about 1 5 billion in aid and low interest loans into the south pacific since 2011 putting it behind only australia according to an analysis by australian think tank the lowy institute and that figure rises to over 6 billion when future commitments are included china s use of loans and aid to gain influence in developing nations worldwide is nothing new as illustrated by chinese financed projects from africa to latin america and the asian subcontinent some worry that these can become debt traps when nations can t repay in sri lanka for example the government was forced to hand over control of its hambantota port as it struggles to repay loans it got from china to build the facility a move that has given beijing a strategic foothold within hundreds of miles of rival india wang said china has only benevolent intentions in tonga and no hidden agenda some people in the west are being over sensitive and too suspicious he said no need advertisement it s not just money flowing in from china chinese immigrants began arriving in the 1990s when tonga started selling passports the passports which went for about 10 000 each were aimed at attracting wealthy hong kong residents hedging their bets ahead of the former british colony s return to china in 1997 instead they were snapped up by rural chinese looking for a better life and who now compete with native tongans for scarce jobs chinese immigrants already run most of the dozens of hole in the wall groceries dotting the islands selling cheap imports like potato chips and canned meat and tongans worry they are now expanding into farming and construction most tongans live a subsistence existence in a nation where the king is revered and people take christianity so seriously that working on sundays is with few exceptions banned under the constitution the economy relies on foreign aid and cash sent home by tongans working abroad and the chinese loans haven t changed that because the money went to chinese run projects fuko said they brought the money they brought the workers they brought the building materials he said maybe a few tongans pulled wheelbarrows advertisement wang acknowledged the criticism that chinese immigrants run many businesses but said tonga s leaders recognise the contribution they make and have even called on tongans to learn from their hard work ethic tonga never benefited from the passport money either a former financial adviser to the government american jesse bogdonoff helped place about 26 million into speculative investments and almost all of it evaporated the real threat to tonga s future may lie in its crippling loans from china in december 2017 the international monetary fund increased tonga s debt distress rating from moderate to high risk citing its vulnerability to natural disasters and noting that the large upcoming loan repayments to china would reduce tonga s foreign exchange reserves double its debt servicing costs and could force the country to borrow yet more money repayments were due to start last year and panic crept in in august prime minister akilisi pohiva called on other pacific nations to join forces to demand debt relief warning that china could snatch away buildings and other assets but he reversed his position days later saying tonga was exceedingly grateful for china s help advertisement within months tonga announced it had been given a reprieve and didn t need to start repayments for another five years tonga also said it was joining china s belt and road initiative the trillion dollar global investment and lending program that is a signature policy of president xi jinping tongan officials don t seem eager to discuss the relationship with china the prime minister withdrew from an interview because of an illness while finance minister pohiva tu i onetoa cancelled at the last minute due to something urgent the chief secretary to the prime minister s office edgar cocker agreed to meet but then quickly asked a reporter to leave saying he wasn t authorised to speak for the government cocker said all questions about china s loans and aid should be directed to chinese officials wang said there was no link between tonga getting a break on its loans and joining the belt and road initiative he said tonga had raised concerns about the loan and china was willing to help advertisement tonga s immediate financial crisis has been averted but fuko thinks the loans have given china the upper hand i don t know how we are going to pay that back the former legislator said an unintended consequence of tonga s china loans could be a reduction in foreign investment and withering of the revenues needed to pay them back take the scenic hotel one of the few large hotels on the main island of tongatapu it abruptly closed its doors in march in a setback to the key tourism industry brendan taylor managing director of the new zealand based scenic hotel group said one problem was the new foreign exchange control act tonga introduced last year designed to keep money in the country and protect its currency during financial emergencies it was enacted as tonga prepared to begin making the chinese loan repayments advertisement the issue you have got in tonga is that no overseas companies are keen to go in taylor said they ve cut out investors he said the hotel got a large insurance payout after it was hit by cyclone gita but the new law created legal hurdles to move money out of tonga to pay new zealand suppliers for repairs and so the payout languished in a tongan trust account he said tonga based lawyer ralph stephenson said that while the law isn t being enforced it s still spooking investors the penalties for breaching the act are draconian in terms of fines that can be imposed and also in so far as the act actually affords the courts the power to forfeit property he said wang said any suggestion that china might be engaged in a pacific power struggle with the west or using tonga to keep tabs or even spy on new zealand and australia is nonsense tonga is a small country it s almost impossible to hide any secret wang said for some of our western friends personally i think they should be confident in their relations and influence in this region advertisement if china sees any strategic importance to tonga it was the country s recognition that taiwan is part of china he said tonga switched from recognising taiwan and established formal diplomatic relations with beijing in 1998 china s economic success has allowed it to build new embassies around the world and too much shouldn t be read into the size of its new embassy in tonga wang said he said that over the past 20 years diplomatic relations between china and tonga have widened to include infrastructure trade education and sports he doesn t see it as a case of larger countries jockeying for influence i don t think so he said just whoever is able to provide assistance for the goodness of the tongan people but for ola koloi who runs a tourist lodge china s footprint is too pervasive influencing what she can buy since so many goods for sale come from china she said the china loans should worry every tongan i feel like i ll be chinese soon she said aap
are investors placing too much hope in the fed as us china trade war lingers analysts see fewer rate cuts than markets as uncertainties over the us china trade war continue to weigh on sentiment

interest rate cuts or about 75 basis points this year most observers however said they expected cuts of 25 to 50 basis points unless the trade war escalates further given that the market is pricing in roughly three rate cuts by the end of the year anything less would disappoint expectations and cause headwinds for asian credit and currencies mark haefele ubs s chief investment officer for global wealth management and min lan tan the head of the swiss bank s asia pacific chief investment office for global wealth management said in a recent report the fed is expected to announce its decision on interest rates on july 31 but investors could get a preview when fed chairman jerome powell testifies over the next two days before the house financial services committee and the senate banking committee in washington hiring rebounded strongly in june in the us easing fears the american economy was weakening and could take pressure off the fed to act immediately advertisement advertisement but that has not stopped us president donald trump from sharply criticising the central bank as he continues to press the fed to cut rates if we had a fed that would lower interest rates we d be like a rocket ship trump said last week larry kudlow director of the white house s national economic council said at a cnbc event on tuesday the fed s last interest rate increase in december was unnecessary story continues donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 24 2019 frances donald manulife investment management s chief economist and head of macroeconomic strategy said on tuesday two rate cuts were likely this year as insurance against deteriorating growth in the face of heightened uncertainty but also to stroke inflationary pressures which have been absent if the trade war escalates further rate cuts could be in the mix donald said the big question for the fed is whether the trade war reignites after the united states and china reached a ceasefire following discussions between trump and chinese president xi jinping at the g20 summit last month nomura said on tuesday the us was likely to put tariffs on nearly all goods imported from china by the end of this year which could cause china to ramp up its own stimulus the us already has 25 per cent tariffs on about us 250 billion of chinese made products but held off adding tariffs on another us 300 billion of goods many that would directly led to american consumers paying higher prices advertisement advertisement on wednesday s p global ratings cut its economic growth forecast for asia pacific to 5 1 per cent for this year and 2020 saying growth in capital expenditure had softened in the region because of the trade war and is negative impact on more trade dependent economies we still believe that achieving a comprehensive deal that would remove uncertainty from the bilateral economic relationship is challenging said shaun roache s p s asia pacific chief economist thorny issues remain on market access intellectual property protection an agreement monitoring mechanism and potentially restructuring china s state owned entities one side may need to make substantial concessions to arrive at a lasting deal and while this is possible it seems unlikely at least over the next 12 months will leung head of investment strategy for standard chartered s wealth management business in hong kong however said the majority of the negative associated with the trade war had already been priced into the market geopolitics is clearly an area of concern while risks are impossible to quantify and difficult to factor into decision making they argue for a less aggressive investment stance than would otherwise be the case standard chartered s global investment committee said in its latest outlook in our view trade tensions are a symptom of the shift from a us centric world order to a more multipolar one amid rising chinese economic military and political power to what degree the us accepts china s increased role in global affairs will be key to the evolution of us china tensions in the coming years advertisement advertisement standard chartered said one to two rate cuts by the fed were likely to extend the economic cycle helping to ensure a slowdown in economic growth that is a temporary soft spot rather than the early stages of a recession aninda mitra senior sovereign analyst at bny mellon investment management said he expected the fed to take out some insurance with a rate cut of as much as 50 basis points this summer our view is also the us economy is not slumping labour markets are still tight he said we think one off or two rate cuts back to back would be sufficient to lend some support as global uncertainty takes its toll on trade volumes athanasios vamvakidlis a bank of america merrill lynch forex strategist said uncertainty over trade was affecting the weak global economic outlook and risks for an even sharper slowdown will increase fast if the uncertainty persists advertisement advertisement the fed has positioned itself between a rock and a hard place vamvakidlis said the data was strong other data has been mixed or even weak but the overall picture does not justify the aggressive monetary policy easing that markets are pricing unless in a trade war scenario and particularly when we take into account the limited policy ammunition which the fed may not want to waste we see a risk that the fed may disappoint markets no matter what they do this article originally appeared in the south china morning post scmp the most authoritative voice
