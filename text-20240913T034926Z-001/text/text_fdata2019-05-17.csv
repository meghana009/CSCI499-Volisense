by godwin emefiele it is an honour and a privilege to be given the opportunity to deliver this special convocation lecture at a renowned institution that has indeed played a formidable role in my personal development as well as in the advancement of my career in this regard i will like to thank the chancellor his royal majesty the ooni of ife oba enintan ogunwusi ii the vice chancellor prof benjamin ozumba along with the faculty and staff of the university of nigeria nsukka for the honor granted to me today looking back at the period i spent at the university of nigeria nsukka both as a student and as a lecturer the university was known for its commitment to driving research and development as well as in imparting to its students knowledge that can be applied for the betterment of society over thirty years later i am aware that this commitment to fostering knowledge that can be used for the benefit of society has not waned even in the midst of difficult challenges as policy makers work to harness the huge potentials of the nigerian economy universities like the university of nigeria nsukka will play a critical role in not only supporting research and development of ideas that will support the growth of our country but in also ensuring that the skill sets obtained by its graduating students can be utilized to meet the growing needs of the nigerian economy in my paper today i will like to share my thoughts on some of the factors that led to the economic recession between 2016 2017 the policy measures implemented by both the monetary and fiscal authorities and some of the measures we ought to consider in our efforts to build an economy that will support improved wealth and job creation for a majority of nigerians on assumption of office as governor of the central bank of nigeria in june 2014 one of my cardinal objectives was to create a people focused central bank a central bank that will promote macro economic objectives such as low inflation and a stable exchange rate along with a focus on promoting inclusive growth and reducing unemployment in the country i believed that these objectives were necessary in nigeria given the constraints faced by rural dwellers as well as small and medium scale businesses in the country the economic recession between 2016 2017 provided additional impetus on the need to promote a pro growth strategy that will reduce our reliance on earnings from the sale of crude oil as well as our dependence on the importation of items that can be produced in nigeria factors that triggered the economic recessionbetween 2014 2017 the global economy witnessed several adverse shocks three of which were simultaneous and significant in shaping the trajectory of the nigerian economy namely i widespread and rising geopolitical tensions along critical trading routes in the world beginning in march 2014 with the united states led sanctions on russia for its annexation of cremia and alleged role in precipitating the crisis conflict in ukraine other areas include britain s desire to pull out from the european union and rising trade tensions between the united states and china with its attendant implications on global trade and capital flows ii crude oil prices the 60 percent drop in oil prices between 2014 2016 exposed the structural vulnerabilities of oil dependent economies like ours in july 2014 global crude oil prices began a sharp descent the price of bonny light nigeria s crude plunged from about us 115 per barrel in june 2014 to as low as us 31 per barrel by january 2016 andiii normalization of monetary policy by the united states federal reserve system this measure led to an acute capital flow reversals especially in emerging markets and increased financial fragilities in these countries in october 2014 the us federal reserve commenced the tapering of its quantitative easing in preparation for a more conventional monetary tightening cycle in an effort to contain rising inflation the fed fund rate was raised steadily to 2 25 percent in december 2018 domestic economywhereas these three factors had adverse consequences on the nigerian economy the most important factor was the drop in commodity prices the country s overdependence on crude oil for over 60 percent of government revenue and for 90 percent of its foreign exchange inflows meant that shocks in the oil market were transmitted entirely to the economy via the fx markets as manufacturers and traders who required forex to purchase their inputs as well as goods were faced with a depleting supply of foreign exchange in the country for example average monthly inflows of foreign exchange into the cbn fell from over us 3 4 billion in june 2014 to as low as us 500 million in october 2016 the decline in foreign exchange earnings was further complicated by the foreign capital flow reversals from emerging markets due to the interest rate hike in the usa the impact of this decline on our economy was evident in the rise in the value of the us dollar relative to the naira and a rise in the consumer price index due to the increase in the cost of imported inputs food items petroleum price transportation costs as well as goods and services with the drop in foreign exchange inflows the exchange rate at the parallel market rose from n200 in august 2015 to n525 in january 2017 inflation also rose from 9 in january 2016 to over 18 in january 2017 our external reserves fell from about 31bn in april 2015 to 23bn in october 2016 and activities in the manufacturing sector witnessed a lull as manufacturers struggled to get access to key inputs needed in the production process other vulnerabilities include slowdown in government spending following the drop in government revenue build up in the demand for foreign exchange and high exposure of the banking sector to the oil and gas sector driven largely by the downside effects of these shocks real gdp growth plunged sharply from 6 2 percent in 2014 to a 1 6 percent contraction in 2016 nigeria effectively slipped into a technical recession in the second quarter of 2016 and maintained negative growths in all quarters of that year quarterly disaggregation of the 2016 outcomes showed the worst contraction of 2 4 percent and a turning point thereafter addressing the recession the monetary and fiscal policy mixin a bid to contain rising inflation and to cushion the impact of the drop in fx supply on the nigerian economy the monetary and fiscal authorities took extraordinary measures to meet these extraordinary challenges some of the measures we took include 1 monetary policy over the intervening period of the slowdown in the economy the cbn embarked on a cycle of tightening which culminated in a july 2016 hike in the monetary policy rate from 12 percent to 14 percent this decision was expected to rein in expected inflationary pressures that may result from exchange rate pass through to domestic prices and ensure that inflation expectations are well anchored it was also expected to set off increased capital inflows to the country which should improve accretion to reserves 2 conserving our foreign exchange we introduced a demand management approach in order to conserve our reserves and support domestic production of items that can be produced in nigeria in this regard we analyzed our import bill and encouraged manufacturers to consider local options in sourcing their raw materials by restricting access to foreign exchange on 43 items four of these items alone constituted over n1 trillion of our import bill 3 risk based supervision the weakening of the naira following the shift to a more flexible foreign exchange mechanism along with the exposure of several banks to the oil an d gas sector impacted somewhat on the balance sheets of domestic banks to support the health of the banking system the cbn took a number of steps including i monitoring compliance of supervised institutions with the foreign exchange management framework issued in june 2016 through our risk based supervision methodology which also involved reviewing international trade and foreign exchange operations of local banks ii monitoring the financial position and performance of supervised institutions iii assessment of the risk profile and governance management practices of banks in the event of major deteriorations on any key risk indicator we engaged with the affected bank in order to mitigate concerns and shore up their capital base 1 foreign exchange market in april 2017 we introduced an investors and exporters fx i e which allowed investors and exporters to purchase and sell foreign exchange at the prevailing market rate in addition exchange rate management was further liberalized following the approval of the revised guidelines for the operation of the nigerian inter bank foreign exchange market on june 15 2016 and its operationalization on june 20 2016 the commencement of this policy guideline introduced the naira settled foreign exchange futures market 2 growth enhancing fiscal policy the fiscal authorities concentrated on examining ways in which fiscal policy could support household consumption and business investments as these two factors make up more than 85 percent of nigeria s gdp by expenditure in this regard the federal government budgets were readjusted to adequately address priority infrastructure needs that would support improved investments by the private sector this was complemented by various presidential initiatives on improving the ease of doing business in nigeria dismantling regulatory bottlenecks enhancing competitiveness and industrialization 3 development finance intervention the cbn increased its lending to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors through targeted intervention schemes such as the anchor borrowers program commercial agricultural credit scheme and the real sector support facility in particular the cbn sought to improve domestic supply of four commodities rice fish sugar and wheat which consume about n1 3 trillion annually in our nation s import bill the anchor borrowers programme abp which was launched in november 2015 by president muhammadu buhari was designed to build partnerships between small holder farmers and reliable large scale agro processors with a view to increasing agricultural output while improving access to credit for farmers our targeted focus on the agricultural and industrial sectors were driven by the vast opportunities for growth given our high population these sectors were instrumental in taking nigeria out of the recession in 2017 over 50 of the contributions to gdp growth came from the agriculture and industrial sectors these sectors have the ability to absorb the growing labor pool of eligible workers and can help meet the household consumption needs of the nigerian market if efforts are made to improve productivity gains in these sectors it will reduce our dependence on imported items that can be produced in nigeria furthermore improved productivity in the agriculture and industrial sectors could also help in diversifying the wealth base of our country in 2017 nigeria s total revenue from exports of crude oil was 23 billion relative to indonesia which earned close to 22bn from the export of palm oil in 2017 nigeria has vast amounts of arable land that can be utilized to cultivate not only palm oil but also cotton tomatoes and rice supporting growth in the agriculture and industrial sector is critical in our efforts to wean our nation from its reliance on proceeds from crude oil other growth support interventions initiated by the bank include the n222 billion micro small and medium enterprise development fund msmedf n300 billion real sector support facility rssf n213 billion nigeria electricity market stabilization facility nemsf n200 billion commercial agriculture credit scheme cacs and the n300 billion non oil export support fund in most of these interventions loans were granted at a concessionary rate of 9 0 per cent 4 financial inclusion the cbn also embarked on several financial inclusion strategies to counter the effects of recession and ensure stability in the financial sector one of such measures includes the launch of the national collateral registry which enable smes to provide movable assets as collateral in order to obtain loans from financial institutions rather than providing fixed assets as collateral in addition we developed policy guidelines for the issuance of a payment service bank license under this policy regime fintechs fast moving consumer goods and telecommunication firms with the permission of the central bank of nigeria can set up entities that will provide limited financial services to individuals in underserved parts of the country 5 bailout programme the cbn intervened with a bailout to sub national governments who could not pay their workers for several months this measure was intended to provide temporary support to states grappling with dwindling finances while they embarked on measures to improve internally generated revenue in their respective states policy outcomes and exit from recession gdp after 5 consecutive quarters of negative growth beginning in the 1st quarter of 2016 a coordinated approach by the fiscal and monetary authorities supported a rebound in the nation s economy during the second quarter of 2017 the recovery has been driven largely by improved non oil activities especially the agriculture sector which expanded consistently by about 3 5 4 3 percent reflecting government s efforts at diversifying the economy this was nonetheless reinforced by the pickup in the oil sector as oil prices rallied in 2017 the gradual re orientation of the economic structure towards the agriculture sector reflects the diversification drive of the government which was supported by the development finance initiatives of the cbn the recovery has been sustained for seven consecutive quarters the pace of quarterly gdp growth has improved from 5 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 2 38 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 the short term outlook continued to strengthen with average growth projections of about 2 8 percent for 2019 up from 1 81 percent in 2018 inflation as a result of the implementation of a tighter monetary policy regime and improved fx inflows inflation began to decline from its peak of 18 7 percent in january 2017 it currently stands at 11 25 percent as at march 2019 interestingly for the first time during a general election cycle our inflation rate declined from 11 37 percent in january 2019 to 11 25 percent in march 2019 due to our measures aimed at containing liquidity and supporting improved production of staple food items reserves the introduction of the investors and exporters window also helped in shoring up our external reserves transactions in the i e fx window has reached over 48 billion since the inception of the window and our foreign exchange reserves has risen to 45bn in april 2019 from 23bn in october 2016 nigeria s current stock of external reserves is now able to finance 9 months of current import commitments with improved availability of foreign exchange the exchange rate at the i e fx window has remained stable over the past 24 months at an average n360 and the parallel market exchange rate has appreciated from n525 in february 2017 to n360 today anchor borrowers program the program has helped to bolster agricultural production by removing obstacles faced by small holder farmers we have also improved access to markets for farmers by facilitating greater partnership with agro processors and manufacturing firms in the sourcing of raw materials so far the program has supported more than 1 059 604 small holder farmers across all the 36 states of nigeria in cultivating 16 different commodities over 1 114 million hectares of farmland it has also supported the creation of over 2 5m jobs across the agricultural value chain a key emphasis was placed on improving rice production given the considerable weight importation of rice had on nigeria s import bill this focus has enabled increased production of rice in the country which has led to net savings of 800 million in our import bill as a result of drastic declines in rice importation manufacturing sector activities in the manufacturing sector also witnessed significant improvement between august 2016 and february 2019 as the primary manufacturing index rose from a low of 42 in august 2016 to 57 in february 2019 this development was attributed to sustained supply of foreign exchange and the dogged implementation of our fx restriction on certain items as a result we have recorded spectacular improvements in domestic production of most of these items local manufacturers are reporting major boosts to their revenue and profit due to this policy peer review in assessing nigeria s recovery efforts and performance it is essential to conduct a comparative assessment of our peers strikingly it will be discovered that nigeria did not fare badly vis à vis other emerging market economies like brazil south africa turkey and argentina that had similar economic experiences amidst the growing challenges nigeria has managed to keep real gdp growth positive and has avoided a double dip recession in contrast to some other emerging markets economies in comparison and following its 2016 contractions the south african economy recorded a double dip recession with renewed contractions of 2 6 and 0 7 percent in the first and second quarters of 2018 respectively its economy grew by 8 percent in 2018 in argentina though the economy was in recession throughout 2016 moderate upticks which peaked at 1 9 percent quarter two of 2017 ended that recession however the argentinian economy fell back into a recession as gdp growth declined by 1 percent in 2018 the brazilian economy had been in recession since 2015 and only emerged from it the first quarter of 2017 with a growth rate of 1 0 percent since then the growth has slowed progressively until the last quarter of 2017 when growth remained flat economic recovery still remains tepid with a gdp growth rate of 1 1 percent in 2018 outlookglobal growth momentum continued to weaken in the light of ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions this is aggravated by weakening demand in many advanced economies and financial market fragilities in many emerging markets and developing economies accordingly global growth projections are estimated at 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 lower than a growth of 3 9 percent estimated for 2018 medium term outlook are lowered for advance economies generally as the prevailing trade war with china is expected to dampen growth impetus in the usa in emerging markets the slowdown of the chinese economy is expected to continue into the medium term in addition developments in the exploration of shale oil have led to the emergence of the united states as the world s biggest crude oil producer ahead of saudi arabia and russia overall crude production in the united states has climbed to a weekly record of 12 million bbl d up from 9 3m barrels in 2017 and production is expected to exceed 20m barrels by 2025 according to information from the eia output from the us will continue to put downward pressures on oil prices notwithstanding the output cut by opec members in order to shore up oil prices as a result it is important to note that the associated headwinds which led to the economic crisis between 2015 2017 still remain road to sustainable growthhave these unconventional tools employed by the central bank been effective skeptics have pointed out that the pace of recovery has been slow with gdp growth averaging only slightly higher than a 2 percent annual rate over the past few years and inflation remains above the cbn 6 9 percent threshold what the critics fail to note is that our economic recovery has faced powerful headwinds as oil revenues constitute over 90 of our export earnings notwithstanding the fact that oil prices are yet to return to their pre 2015 levels the cbn has been able to reduce inflation build our fx reserves while maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market challenges still remain such as ensuring that the pace of gdp growth remains well ahead of our annual population growth at 2 7 percent but this can only be achieved if we continue to support efforts aimed at improving domestic production of goods in nigeria as a result the recommended steps below may be required in order to promote sustainable growth of the nigerian economy i significantly increase the country s policy buffers including fiscal measures to increase the external reserve ii diversify the revenue structure of the federal government inorder to rely much less on direct proceeds from sale of crude oil iii proactive fiscal actions specifically infrastructure investment is required to enhance economic growthiv provision of cheap financing to boost local production of priority goods in critical sectors of the economy in order to reduce reliance on foreign imports v universities have a considerable role to play in working with the private and public sector in supporting research and development of solutions that can be applied to enhance the growth of the nigerian economy in addition they will also have to enhance their curriculum so students are well equipped with the skill sets that are required to support nigeria s growth in this digital era conclusionin concluding i have examined various developments principally activities in the domestic and global economies that led nigeria s economy into the recession in 2016 and its eventual recovery in 2017 building on measures implemented by the fiscal and monetary authorities towards addressing the constraints of farmers smes and manufacturers will be critical in order to drive sustainable growth of the nigerian economy and reduce our reliance on proceeds from the sale of crude oil in addition forging partnerships between universities research institutions the private sector and public sector institutions in developing and implementing solutions that aid productivity in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors will be important in order to build a sustainable productive base for the nation i thank you very much for your attention and thank you once again for being here today being a paper presented by cbn governor godwin emefiele at special convocation of

workmans of abadan refinery at lunch time 1913 wikimedia commons examining iran s economic history pre and post revolution curated reviewed by matthew a mcintosh public historian brewminate introduction prior to 1979 iran s economic development was rapid traditionally an agricultural society by the 1970s the country had undergone significant industrialization and economic modernization this pace of growth had slowed dramatically by 1978 as capital flight reached 30 to 40 billion 1980 us dollars just before the revolution after the revolution of 1979 iran s government proceeded with 4 reforms first they nationalized all industry including the nioc and all iranian banks the new constitution divided the economy in 3 different sectors namely state cooperative and private with the majority being state owned businesses the government started using central planning to control the economy having the supreme leader the president and majlis creating 5 year socio economic plans the state took control of setting prices and subsidies the government s long term objectives since the revolution have been economic independence full employment and a comfortable standard of living for citizens but at the end of the 20th century the country s economy faced many obstacles iran s population more than doubled between 1980 and 2000 and grew increasingly younger although a relatively large number of iranians are farmers agricultural production has consistently fallen since the 1960s by the late 1990s iran had become a major importer of food at that time economic hardship in the countryside resulted in vast numbers of people moving to cities the eight year war with iraq claimed at least 300 000 iranian lives and injured more than 500 000 the cost of the war to the country s economy was some 500 billion after hostilities with iraq ceased in 1988 the government tried to develop the country s communication transportation manufacturing health care education and energy sectors including its prospective nuclear power facilities and began the process of integrating its communication and transportation infrastructure with that of neighboring states since 2004 supreme leader khamenei and president ahmadinejad have tried to implement reforms that will lead to the privatization of iran but they haven t worked out yet making iran a command economy in transition towards a market economy pahlavi era 1925 1979 reza shah pahlavi r 1925 41 improved the country s overall infrastructure implemented educational reform campaigned against foreign influence reformed the legal system and introduced modern industries during this time iran experienced a period of social change economic development and relative political stability in the interwar period modern industries were introduced whereas fewer than 20 modern industrial plants existed in 1925 by 1941 more than 800 new plants had been established with the intention of reducing the country s dependence on imports the state encouraged industrialization by raising tariffs financing modern industries and imposing government monopolies changes in the legal system tax structure and trade policies attracted domestic financial resources and led to the emergence of a group of new young entrepreneurs the shah s court became the biggest investor in the new industries primarily by confiscating real estate the shah himself became the country s richest man increased investment in mining construction and the manufacturing sector occurred and infrastructure investment grew significantly iran had only 250 kilometers of railroads and 2 400 kilometers of gravel roads in 1925 by 1938 these totals had increased to 1 700 and 12 000 kilometers respectively industrial growth was not balanced however integration among sectors and industries was absent and the new industries met only part of the growing domestic demand agriculture from which 90 percent of the labor force made its living did not benefit from economic reform furthermore the expanding areas of the economy were not labor intensive modern sectors caspian sea fisheries railroads seaports the oil industry modern factories and coal fields absorbed a total of only about 170 000 workers less than 4 percent of the labor force the government managed the expansion of international trade by techniques such as the foreign exchange controls imposed in 1936 many new items were among the imported goods required by industry the military railroads and other areas of infrastructure investment traditional agricultural and industrial export products were replaced by oil exports germany became iran s primary trading partner by 1940 accounting for 42 percent of its foreign trade the united states was second with 23 percent the soviet union also was a major trading partner in this period despite many advances in domestic and foreign economic policy however iran remained an exporter of raw materials and traditional goods and an importer of both consumer and capital goods in the years before world war ii reza shah pahlavi who abdicated in 1941 was succeeded by his son mohammad reza shah pahlavi r 1941 79 no fundamental change occurred in the iranian economy during world war ii 1939 45 and the years immediately following however between 1954 and 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to greater investment and fast paced economic growth primarily in the government sector subsequently inflation increased the value of the national currency the rial depreciated and a foreign trade deficit developed economic policies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of nominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961 abadan refinery built 1913 wikimedia commons in response to these setbacks iran initiated its third economic development plan 1962 68 with an emphasis on industrialization new economic policies significantly altered the role of the private sector the expansion of private and public banks as well as the establishment of two specialized banks provided reliable credit markets for medium and large scale private manufacturing enterprises not limited to cheap credit government programs also included a wide range of incentives to encourage investment in new industries by both iranian and foreign businesses most new investment was a joint effort between either the public sector and foreign investors or private businesses and foreign corporations investment in roads highways dams bridges and seaports also increased with government support part of the agricultural sector also attracted significant investment many large scale agricultural operations in meat dairy products and fruit production were established small scale farmers however did not benefit from the new investment opportunities under the fourth and the fifth economic development plans 1968 73 1973 78 the iranian economy became increasingly open to imports and foreign investment a combination of oil revenues public spending and foreign and domestic investments enlarged the middle class in major cities particularly tehran in the wake of the spike in crude oil prices that followed the 1973 war pitting egypt and syria against israel the process of industrialization and consumption grew rapidly between 1973 and 1977 the specialized banks provided more than 200 billion rials to the manufacturing sector and the increase in investment averaged 56 percent per year a flood of imported goods and raw materials overwhelmed the capacity of seaports and warehouses the military was also a beneficiary of the new economic and social conditions military personnel modern artillery and equipment and military training absorbed a major part of the budget shah s portrait at the 1000 iranian rial bank note wikimedia commons between fiscal year 1964 and fy 1978 iran s gross national product grew at an annual rate of 13 2 percent at constant prices the oil gas and construction industries expanded by almost 500 percent during this period while the share of value added manufacturing increased by 4 percent women s participation in the labor force in urban areas increased large numbers of urban iranian women from varying social strata joined the semiskilled and skilled labor forces in addition the number of women enrolling in higher education increased from 5 000 in fy 1967 to more than 74 000 in fy 1978 economic growth however became increasingly dependent on oil revenues in the 1970s by 1977 oil revenues had reached us 20 billion per year 79 percent of total government revenues other sectors of the economy and regions of the country did not experience a uniform pattern of growth during this period agriculture traditional and semi traditional industries and the services sector did not thrive to the same extent as the modern state sponsored manufacturing industries which accounted for only 6 percent of industrial employment as employment opportunities in rural areas and traditional industries decreased public employment in urban areas increased the proportion of self employed iranians remained stable accelerated development of the middle class was a major outcome of the 1960s and 1970s among this class were the new professional intelligentsia called motekhassesin experts their common denominator was the professional cultural or administrative expertise acquired through modern education nevertheless the patterns of economic growth and regional development along with the political underdevelopment of the shah s regime in areas such as civil institutions human rights and property rights limited opportunities for the majority of iranians to develop fully their social and economic potential economic and social polarization minimized competition among businesses and limited development to the part of the economy concerned with the interests of dominant groups closely tied to the shah s court and the state most iranians were excluded from political and economic decision making after the 1979 revolution iran gdp cpi and current account data 1980 2010 wikimedia commons according to the 1979 iranian constitution it is the duty of the islamic government to furnish all citizens with equal and appropriate opportunities to provide them with work and to satisfy their essential needs so that the course of their progress may be assured iran s long term objectives since the 1979 revolution have been economic independence full employment and a comfortable standard of living for citizens but at the end of the 20th century the country s economic future faces many obstacles iran s population more than doubled in a 20 year period with an increasingly young population although a relatively large part of the population engages in farming agricultural production has fallen consistently since the 1960s by the late 1990s iran was a major food importer and economic hardship in the countryside had driven vast numbers of people to migrate to cities the rates of literacy and life expectancy in iran are high for the region but so is the unemployment rate and inflation is in the range of 20 annually iran remains highly dependent on one major industry the extraction of petroleum and natural gas for export and the government faces increasing difficulty in providing opportunities for a younger better educated workforce such lack of opportunities has led to a growing sense of frustration among lower and middle class iranians following the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the iran iraq war over 80 of iran s economy came under the control of the government after the end of hostilities with iraq in 1988 the government tried to develop the country s communication transportation manufacturing health care education and energy infrastructures including its prospective nuclear power facilities and has begun the process of integrating its communication and transportation infrastructure with that of neighboring states it is estimated that iran sustained a loss of 500 billion through the iraq war in 1996 the u s government passed the iran and libya sanctions act ilsa which prohibits u s and non u s companies from investing and trading with iran for more than 20 million annually with the exception since 2000 for items like

product experts investment consultants mid and back office support personnel and etc s that service are provided through team collaborations instead of single relationship managers to meet

speak in chinese and her remarks will be followed by english translation jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language thank you zhao yi in the first quarter of 2019 china has been adopting favorable macro policies specifically maintain a relatively illiquid monetary policy and the asian market performed strongly in the backdrop looking at current economic data for q1 including gdp foreign trade finance and other metrics the economy outperformed expectations as a whole and operations of private enterprises have also improved at a certain extent for china s wealth management and asset management industries 2018 was a year of adjustments according to the latest china private bank report 2019 jointly issued by boston consulting group and china construction bank despite the ongoing growth momentum in total wealth of domestic residents the growth rate in 2018 was only 8 significantly dropping behind the compound average growth rate of 16 during prior 2013 to 2017 domestic high net worth individuals with investible financial assets over rmb6 million only increased by 6 in 2018 moreover with increased complexity in the domestic economic home front and foreign trade frictions investor s aversion to risk increased significantly at the same time individual investors understanding of risks and rationality of investments are going through the volatile market and their long term expectation of investment return is normalizing with the adjusted market conditions foreign language meanwhile the same china private bank report 2019 also estimated that during the next 5 years the investible financial assets of chinese individuals will recover to a compound growth rate of 11 specifically for the high net worth individuals with invested assets transferred continuously from real estate properties and corporate direct investment to financial assets the compound growth rate of the investible financial assets will exceed that of the industry to 16 so we strongly believe that asset management industry will continue to be attractive in china combining the asset management with wealth management business has better positioned noah with higher profitability and less vulnerability to economic cycle with the maturing of all stakeholders in these two industries mingled with the ongoing wealth accumulation brought by stable macroeconomic growth the increase investment in financial assets promoted by the aging population as well as the technological innovation accelerated by the internet the overall asset allocation demands including the global asset allocation demand has been and will continue to be of utmost importance to domestic clients foreign language now let me share with you some updates of our product strategy in terms of the primary market by the end of the first quarter of 2019 the aum of gopher s private equity investments reached rmb101 1 billion up 10 year on year since the beginning of 2019 the domestic private equity market has remained sluggish in terms of fund raising investment and assets similar to 2018 our strategy for this year is to still focus on offering first year funds enhancing bundled fund operations and keep improving direct investment capabilities over the past eight years gopher has invested directly and indirectly in over 210 funds and over 4 800 enterprises among which more than 160 enterprises has been successfully listed at home and abroad and 78 has grown into unicorns valued at over 1 billion we believe that as the system construction of china s capital market continues to improve especially with the founding of registration system for public listing on the science and technology innovation board china s private equity industry will establish a smoother exit mechanism and noah will be one of the beneficiaries foreign language in the public market after the spring festival 2019 the asian market has embraced the bond and investors risk appetite has gradually picked up beginning this year we have integrated online and offline transaction channels and focused on the mutual fund distribution through our wealth management sales team together with traditional private fund total transaction value of noah s public securities products including mutual fund has rebounded to rmb3 2 billion in the first quarter up 125 sequentially the aum of gopher s public securities investment has also picked up in the first quarter reaching rmb6 9 billion and up 11 quarter over quarter foreign language in terms of credit funds we believe that individual clients have a strong demand for fixed income products with local relations with the stock market on the wealth management front we continue cooperating with leading product providers and credit funds raised in the first quarter were amounted to rmb22 1 billion up 67 year on year and 9 quarter on quarter on the asset management front the aum of credit products by the end of the first quarter stood at rmb38 8 billion while retaining existing products and counterparties we adopted newer strategies since the second half of 2018 delivering standardized bond funds and public abs funds all investing in publicly traded credit securities to increase the breadth of available products at present a complete credit product line has been established with rmb and u s dollar products flexible terms and stable return in 2019 we are focusing on both the scale and the performance of our bond portfolio fund and this strategy has been attracting increasing attention from both institutional and individual clients in terms of us dollars denominated bond and cash management funds we have developed the full product lines actively managed by gopher specifically our flagship us dollar global bond fund has ranked in the top 5 among its peers with respect to its performance since inception in august 2018 in terms of renminbi products by the end of the first quarter gopher s total aum in renminbi bond funds has exceeded rmb1 billion and its aum of cash management funds exceeded rmb5 billion we believe that in the future standardized bonds will become an important portfolio asset for individual investors and we re fully prepared in this regard foreign language in terms of real estate bonds by the end of the first quarter of 2019 aum of gopher real estate investment reached rmb17 4 billion up 46 year over year in retrospect gopher s real estate preferred share funds which were mainly funds raised in the second half of last year has exceeded rmb4 billion in scale and has invested in 15 projects as of the end of the first quarter meanwhile projects invested and managed through our core asset acquisition fund are still operating soundly the occupancy rate of the office building and commercial properties in shanghai gopher center reached 95 and 100 respectively gopher s shanghai plaza will also be reported for official completion in june 2019 against the background of the continuous inflows of foreign capital to acquire china s core assets as well as gradual transition of china s real estate industry from an incremental market to a stock market our extensive experience in real estate investments as well as operation and management are showing their value foreign language from the first quarter of 2019 we officially changed the name of the strategy other investment under gopher s aum to multi strategic investments which represent our progress and achievements in promoting discretionary multi asset funds and family office businesses by the end of the first quarter the aum of gopher s multi strategic investment reached rmb6 9 billion up 92 year on year while attracting sustained client investments our full discretionary asset allocation capability has also won recognition by global professional institutions gopher asset was recently granted best wealth manager in china discretionary and segregated portfolio management by asian private banker as well as the insights mandates 2019 professional investment awards china multi asset strategy 3 years and global multi strategy 3 years foreign language in reviewing 2018 we believe that we now have an even better understanding of our client demands with a core competency that we have accumulated over the past 15 years in terms of product strategy we believe that in the long run it will ensure that bear market such as us market buy and hold the blue chip stocks is a suitable strategy for asset managers however emerging markets feature high volatility of individual stocks wide fluctuation ranges in stock price and rapid rise and collapse of valuation resulting in significant systematic risk therefore simply holding stocks is not the optimal wealth management strategy for emerging markets while the allocation strategy among multiple asset classes provides more due to sustainability our advantages stand out in the market competition in terms of the investment and allocation capabilities of relevant assets such as stocks equities bonds real estate asset backed securities cash management products and others foreign language finally i would like to talk briefly about the industry and regulation environment since 2019 china has continuously opened up the onshore financial market for foreign institutions to acquire financial licenses with increased competition from strong foreign peers domestic wealth management and asset management firms are facing both opportunities and challenges and we also believe that this trend will influence china s wealth management and asset management industries in several aspects first capital pools as implicit guarantees will no longer exist equity portfolio and net based products will gradually dominate the market and unlicensed non compliant institutions will be weeded out second investors will diverge without the protection of guaranteed return investors with low risk tolerance will have to leave the capital market and return to banks while more sophisticated investors will make long term investments in asset management products third the business models of wealth management and asset management institutions will transform from competition in licensed resources rules regulation and regulatory arbitrage to competition in investment management and marketing capabilities with the implementation of the new asset management guidelines that clarify direction of supervision and the continuous opening of financial service market to foreign investors china s asset management and wealth management industry are going toward healthier and more standardized development that is in line with international growth foreign language noah in 2019 we define our core businesses as wealth management asset management lending service insurance brokerage as well as global value added financial services for high net worth clients our objective is to keep sustained growth of clients and aum scale in the wealth management segment we will continue to build our capabilities to serve high net worth chinese in a global scope improve and optimize our relationship manager team and expand our client base in the asset management segment we will focus on improving our capabilities in multi asset allocation and provide comprehensive asset allocation services for high net worth and institutional clients meanwhile we re also seeking for external distribution channels for corporate asset management products to drive its multi dimensional growth currently gopher been included in the want list of several large size securities firms and banks in terms of providing more value added financial services we re mainly targeted in creating more client touch points and cross selling opportunities with a sustained dedication in 2019 we are confident in maintaining efficient operations and quality growth as always thank you all now i will turn the call over to our cfo shang to review our financial results in the first quarter shang chuang chief financial officer thank you chairlady we are pleased to report solid set of financial results for the first quarter of 2019 both net revenues and non gaap attributed income reached historic highs on a quarterly basis total net revenues were rmb889 9 million an increase of 7 1 year over year and non gaap attributable ordinary income was rmb304 6 million up 19 9 year over year in terms of revenue mix we achieved one time commissions in amount of rmb324 6 million up 2 1 from the same quarter last year and up 33 6 from the last quarter the strong sequential rebound was mainly contributed by an 11 4 quarter over quarter growth of transaction value reaching rmb28 billion as well as improvement of effective one time commission from 0 97 to 1 16 mainly contributed by the increased distribution of insurance products recurring service fees in the first quarter of 2019 were rmb420 6 million up 5 7 from the same period last year accounting for about half of total revenues the foreign based income of rmb4 9 million was significantly lower than the first quarter last year because most of the public securities products have not exceeded high watermark of last year and there were no significant exits by other products other service fees were rmb145 4 million primarily driven by our lending services business as well as the increased demands of value added services that we provide in the wealth management business in the first quarter total operating income increased 10 2 year over year to rmb302 5 million with operating efficiency enhancement measures our operating margin increased to 34 2 from 33 a year ago total compensation costs were rmb404 3 million up 12 1 year over year but down 5 6 quarter over quarter as we optimize dour employee base our selling expenses were rmb90 5 million down 14 9 year over year and down 13 7 quarter over quarter general and administrative expenses were also well controlled during the quarter the amount of rmb58 6 million represented a 4 7 increase year over year but 38 3 decrease quarter over quarter non gaap attributable net income for the first quarter was rmb304 6 million a strong increase of 19 9 year over year this quarter we adjusted out rmb29 6 million of share based compensation rmb8 7 million of gains from unrealized fair changes of equity securities and rmb5 7 million of tax effect of adjustments and adjusted rmb4 9 million of gains on sales of equity securities on the balance sheet side the company increased cash and cash equivalent by rmb165 million this quarter operating cash flow generated by core businesses remained strong at rmb152 7 million and in summary we continue to grow our business despite market uncertainty looking ahead we see huge potential in both wealth and asset management industries in china and we are dedicated to creating value for our clients as well as shareholders with that let s open up the call for questions operator questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question is from edward du with deutsche bank please go ahead edward du deutsche bank analyst hi thanks management team for taking my question this is edward from deutsche bank i have two small questions first question is about just so you re active clients increased by around 49 year on year but the total transaction value was up only 1 in first quarter making the average transaction decline by around 32 year on year and my question is about may we know is there any transaction behavior change among your client base or any reason behind this and my second question is about the distribution fee and based on my calculation your distribution fee rate came around 120 bps in first quarter but we do not see any meaningful change in your product distribution mix in fourth quarter compared to full fourth quarter last year and i mean we know any pricing structure change especially in the fixed income product and the secondary market products and that s all my questions thank you shang chuang chief financial officer yes sure thank you i will answer both of your questions so the first question regarding active client transaction value as well as average transaction value per active client so for the first quarter of 2019 one of our strategy was actually to activate or get more of our client base to transact on product and we were able to do so by broadening the type of product that we have conversations with clients and in the first quarter versus last year fy 2018 we engaged clients with mutual funds and we feel that by broadening our asset category to include public securities or wider categories of public security we can engage deeper with our clients and that i think works quite well and so going forward i think both on the wealth management side and asset management side we see opportunities for us to deepen wallet share by expanding into public securities okay so that s for your first question regarding your second question is yes for the first quarter of 2019 effective one time commission rate was up meaningfully to around 1 16 this is up year over year as well as quarter over quarter i think there are two main reasons so the amount of insurance distribution for the first quarter were actually quite robust in addition among the credit products that we distributed for the first quarter 2019 and a portion of it was more longer term fixed income products and for longer term fixed income product we were able to achieve the revenue upfront so those are the two main reasons why we saw effective bundling commission rate is up but it s still within a very long term range of 80 to 100 basis point and so the change is mainly because of product mix rather than any structural trend going forward edward du deutsche bank analyst thank you operator the next question is from george cai with jpmorgan please go ahead george cai jpmorgan analyst hi thank you for taking my question and congratulations on management for the results i have two questions the first one is on the private equity sales as we can see from the first quarter i think the private equity product sales has been quite weak as well compared to the last quarter and on a year over year basis so can you share with us more color on potentially when pe sales could rebound so that s my first question my second question is relating to the lending and other business as we can see the revenue growth has been very robust and we achieved a very sizable profit but then we want to ask on the loan book what s the current status of the asset quality and any what s the provision ratio and i understand this is more for internal clients lending but just want to ask you if we have cooperated with other banks on the core lending side so these are my two questions shang chuang chief financial officer sure for the first question regarding private equity may i allow madam wang to speak about that and then i ll answer george on second question regarding our lending business jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language chuang shang chuang chief financial officer yes so yes i ll translate madam wang to answer for the first question so regarding the new fund raising for private equity overall in the market is still quite soft it s mainly regarding the pace of exits by previous funds as we see in the market general capital market activity has been sluggish in terms of new ipo and new exits but we do see a silver lining as top tier gps are still able to exit they are very top our portfolio companies so our strategy in terms of private equity continues to be focusing on top tier plan our private fund business as well as expanding the amount of co investment and direct investment and so we believe our focus will allow us to capture growth opportunity in private equity on the long term in the short term challenges and difficulties is mainly regarding investors being reluctant to make a very long term investment versus hedge funds or public security given there are still a bit of uncertainty in terms of the macro environment so that s madam wang s response to your first question regarding the second question regarding our lending success madam wang just want to add some high level comments that the lending business she believes is an important complementary business to our wealth management business in terms of our high net worth individuals using financial products will look ph to achieve to obtain short term loan which is it should be synergistic to both of our core businesses now specifically regarding george s question on terms of some of the metrics for our loan business if you people can take a look at our balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter the loan receivables that s on our book is around rmb507 million ok now i want to take this opportunity perhaps to describe the way our lending business works so we would originate loans to our high net worth individuals and most of the time they would have high quality collateral and the average duration is around 9 to 12 months after we originate these loans we will sell or securitize these loan receivable so then they are sold to investors we continue to serve as a servicing agent in terms of the collection and the passing of interest and principal but we re no longer liable for the financial risk so it s in general it s a asset light business if you may in terms of the loans that we are servicing it s roughly about rmb10 billion so for the loans on our book actually we have 1 npl provision but historically the last 2 3 years we have not seen any meaningful default the main reason is because of a high quality of the board as well as the soundness of the collateral that we have when we make that loan when we make those loans thank you jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer operator operator yes sorry the next question is from stephanie poon with citi please go ahead stephanie poon citi analyst hi management team thanks for taking my questions so the first question is regarding your core domain ph of your audit strategy so we understand that like traditionally the alternative products has been your core strengths like for example on the private equity or some loans on the credit side so as you now expanding into this standardized credit products for these mutual funds it seems to be a more competitive area that we see a lots of other traditional banks are focusing also over in these products so can you share with us more about that what you see as your competitive edge here on these standardized products and also as you like expand into this product categories does it also means that you you re penetrating into maybe a lower tier client base and the second part second question is regarding your asset management distribution channels you mentioned earlier that you are expanding into some lower distribution channels can you share with us like any specific channels that you have currently and what is the percentage exposure there and also in terms of the position of this asset management business going forward i guess in the past we used to understand as more as supplementary for your whole wealth management products business to serve your existing high net work individual clients but going forward should we see it as maybe more staying along although business segments that you also expanding into some like external time based so that s my all of my questions thank you shang chuang chief financial officer thank you stephanie just for the benefit of my colleagues who are also on the phone i ll just perhaps just quickly summarize the three questions you raised one is regarding our public securities products specifically mutual fund how that will impact our business second is regarding gopher asset financing asset management s expansion into non noah distribution channels and third is asset position going forward i will answer these three questions and see if madam wang and mr zhao have anything to add so regarding your first question as you know and many of our shareholders are aware noah has been and will continue to be a firm believer of asset allocation over the last 10 years 12 years we have consistently expanded in terms of the product category and investment strategies that we are able to offer and manage for our clients because we believe a true diversified asset allocation is the best way for high net worth individual to ride through capital market volatility and we believe mutual fund should be an important aspect of their toolbox or an important tool in the toolbox and if you look at leading private bank for example ubs their high net worth individuals have 20 to 40 allocation in mutual fund so specifically on this particular strategy is actually in line with our long term strategy of deepening client wallet share rather than us expanding into mass retail so i just want to clarify in terms of our approach toward the mutual funds how do we get more of our existing clients wallet share how do we have or engage more client to transact with us so that s the reply for number one and trying number 2 as ms wang mentioned for gopher i think we have always been seeking ways to broaden the capital sources for gopher we have had some success with large insurance companies but we also see opportunities as gopher established more track record as well as expertise across investment strategy and most recently we have very good progress in terms of mid to large size securities firms in terms of become getting on their preferred list in terms of distributing gopher s public securities product i e kind of hedge fund or others and quantify it and we see as the capital market continue to develop in china we want gopher to be able to grow its aun from all these different sources i guess it s tied to your third question in terms of the long term positioning of gopher i think a very good example would be globally we see a lot of private bank when in these early stages will incubate an asset manager but as the asset management grows and expand its business it s become quite fairly independent i e their capital sources comes from institutions come from other distributors a reference is i believe that and when i spoke with my peers at ubs asset management about 20 to 30 of their capital comes from ubs private bank i e more than half 70 comes from non ubs private banking sources and i think that is a good role model or an example of what gopher can achieve as madam wang mentioned in her prepared remarks and we continue to believe so asset management in china is still very early days if we use a baseball analogy probably only in the second third innings and as the future growth potential it s quite huge for gopher and i believe madam wang technical difficulty i believe madam wang has things to add as well foreign language jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language shang chuang chief financial officer yeah so let me translate madam wang s commentary on the question so for gopher since establishment in 2010 over the last nearly decade i think we have accumulated expertise in the various investment strategies that we operate in and most unfortunately we have now seen the benefits of being an actor ph in terms of asset allocation and diversified solution provider what this means to our investors is delivering low volatility as wage ph and investments strategies have low correlation to each other now we will continue to expand gopher based on inaudible co investment and direct investment with the goal and intention delivering absolute return to investors and we believe we re able to do so by executing on a multi strategy efforts now based on various data that we have accumulated over the years as well as recent conversation and surveys with our clients we believe that we are very well positioned to be the leaving leading brand for multi strategy in china and in terms on the asset manager for alternatives so now adding some comments on our expansion into public security again i want to emphasize this is part of our asset allocation approach it s not aiming to expand into new a client segmentation but rather how do we use new tools to cross sell to existing high net worth clients now for the first quarter i think we had some efforts in terms of mutual fund fundraising and historically we have done a mutual fund on the asset management basis so we are actually quite familiar with this asset category and for some of the funds that we were focused on fund raising in the first quarter the fund raising side that we achieved is actually similar to some of the mid to large banks and the bank and this just shows that the potential of our clients in terms of this asset category the average transaction per client for the mutual fund for our client because much higher than bank now we are confident in terms of getting non noah channels or distributor to specifically ph gopher asset as shang mentioned there are a lot of asset management firms globally that we have originated from wealth management roots but has grown to be very sizable and their reliance on their existing private banking partner with own is now only 10 to 20 so in other words as gopher develops the potential from non noah channel should be even larger than the amount coming from noah currently today jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer operator operator yes our next question is from yuan xue with cicc please go ahead yuan xue cicc analyst foreign language shang chuang chief financial officer yes for the benefit of the audience i will translate the question from the research analyst from cicc so i know from the quarterly disclosure the company has for the first time disclosed segmentation by geographic location and we see for the first quarter 2019 revenue coming from others or other region has made good progress and if you can give us more color on that and so i ll comment on this question and see if my colleagues have anything to add but over the last few years and we continue to express our view to the capital market is that we want to build a global business and since the establishment of the hong kong business in 2012 we have continued to make good progress as of the first quarter of 2019 our overseas markets have contributed roughly about 25 of total revenue and over the next 3 year to 5 year we continue we want to continue to grow that percentage now as you know we set up our this is in the us roughly about 2 5 years to go both in silicon valley and new york both of these offices and the team are focused in terms of product sourcing and developing products and so we re now able to offer vc fund investment opportunities co investment and direct investment opportunity as well as u s insurance products to our clients and so it s an example of how we replicate our success in hong kong to other large capital market or large markets elsewhere in the world we believe our clients are becoming more mobile and global so and definitely in terms of building a global presence will benefit us in the long term operator our next question is from george cai with jpmorgan please go ahead george cai jpmorgan analyst yeah hi thank you for i have a follow up question i think on the net profit there is quite a large gap between the gaap net profit and non gaap profit a large chunk of it i think it s related to the gain unrealized gains from the fair value changes of equity securities so could you add more color on this and going forward do you expect the volatilities could be smaller thank you shang chuang chief financial officer yeah thank you george for the question if you note on page 17 of our 6 k or quarterly disclosure we break out the details of our gaap net income and non gaap net income the largest adjustments actually share based comp which is quite in line with how other let s say company define non gaap net income and part of it the other part of the adjustment comes from fair value changes of equity securities are unrealized and you can define this or interpret this as basically mark to market of equity securities that we hold and the market has been a bit volatile and so we adjust out those noises and then we add back in a realized gain and there is a detailed breakout so i won t read the numbers one by one yeah jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer operator operator this concludes the question and answer session and today s conference call you may disconnect your lines thank you for participating and have a pleasant day

year over year foreign language improving management operating efficiency is an important strategy i put forward at the group level since i took this new rule in the first quarter we mainly focused on this aspect and made important progress foreign language first structural adjustment eliminating ineffective departments merging overlapping departments and upholding flat management in the first

empowering business scenario in the first quarter our relationship management system and clients mobile application micro noah ph were upgraded in all aspects we lead in domestic wealth management industry in achieving online audio and the video recording which quickly improve the sales compliance and optimized the client experience in addition we launched an online relationship manager plus expert servicing core model in four core pilot cities based on different scenarios and the client needs we formed the expert teams composed of relationship manager product experts investment consultants mid and back office support personnel and etc s that service are provided through team collaborations instead of single relationship managers to meet increasingly specialized and the diversified needs of clients last year gopher developed a fully autonomous investment management system or gimsp which clearly demonstrates the status of all funds and that their sub funds and sub projects while closely tracking top down valuation through a phone reading system foreign language fourth system construction setting up an operation management system covering 15 important operation modules and developing management tools and assessment system with a focus on data indicators through quarterly reviews and annual assessments we consistently adjust and optimize our systems to

group level management system featured with data model for monitoring and evaluating the operational efficiency of each business segment we are even more confident about 2019 foreign language focusing on creating values for clients is noah s principle and continuous optimization in response to client needs is noah s direction as the market environment becomes increasingly uncertain noah will continue to build and improved management operating systems and enhance company s ph capabilities in research investment product requirement sales and the comprehensive services so as to become an open and global integrated financial service companies with inaudible foreign language with that i will like to i turn the call over to noah s chairlady and ceo ms wang jingbo she will speak in chinese and her remarks will be followed by english translation jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language thank you zhao yi in the first quarter of 2019 china has been adopting favorable macro policies specifically maintain a relatively illiquid monetary policy and the asian market performed strongly in the backdrop looking at current economic data for q1 including gdp foreign trade finance and other metrics the economy outperformed expectations as a whole and operations of private enterprises have also improved at a certain extent for china s wealth management and asset management industries 2018 was a year of adjustments according to the latest china private bank report 2019 jointly issued by boston consulting group and china construction bank despite the ongoing growth momentum in total wealth of domestic residents the growth rate in 2018 was only 8 significantly dropping behind the compound average growth rate of 16 during prior 2013 to 2017 domestic high net worth individuals with investible financial assets over rmb6 million only increased by 6 in 2018 moreover with increased complexity in the domestic economic home front and foreign trade frictions investor s aversion to risk increased significantly at the same time individual investors understanding of risks and rationality of investments are going through the volatile market and their long term expectation of investment return is normalizing with the adjusted market conditions foreign language meanwhile the same china private bank report 2019 also estimated that during the next 5 years the investible financial assets of chinese individuals will recover to a compound growth rate of 11 specifically for the high net worth individuals with invested assets transferred continuously from real estate properties and corporate direct investment to financial assets the compound growth rate of the investible financial assets will exceed that of the industry to 16 so we strongly believe that asset management industry will continue to be attractive in china combining the asset management with wealth management business has better positioned noah with higher profitability and less vulnerability to economic cycle with the maturing of all stakeholders in these two industries mingled with the ongoing wealth accumulation brought by stable macroeconomic growth the increase investment in financial assets promoted by the aging population as well as the technological innovation accelerated by the internet the overall asset allocation demands including the global asset allocation demand has been and will continue to be of utmost importance to domestic clients foreign language now let me share with you some updates of our product strategy in terms of the primary market by the end of the first quarter of 2019 the aum of gopher s private equity investments reached rmb101 1 billion up 10 year on year since the beginning of 2019 the domestic private equity market has remained sluggish in terms of fund raising investment and assets similar to 2018 our strategy for this year is to still focus on offering first year funds enhancing bundled fund operations and keep improving direct investment capabilities over the past eight years gopher has invested directly and indirectly in over 210 funds and over 4 800 enterprises among which more than 160 enterprises has been successfully listed at home and abroad and 78 has grown into unicorns valued at over 1 billion we believe that as the system construction of china s capital market continues to improve especially with the founding of registration system for public listing on the science and technology innovation board china s private equity industry will establish a smoother exit mechanism and noah will be one of the beneficiaries foreign language in the public market after the spring festival 2019 the asian market has embraced the bond and investors risk appetite has gradually picked up beginning this year we have integrated online and offline transaction channels and focused on the mutual fund distribution through our wealth management sales team together with traditional private fund total transaction value of noah s public securities products including mutual fund has rebounded to rmb3 2 billion in the first quarter up 125 sequentially the aum of gopher s public securities investment has also picked up in the first quarter reaching rmb6 9 billion and up 11 quarter over quarter foreign language in terms of credit funds we believe that individual clients have a strong demand for fixed income products with local relations with the stock market on the wealth management front we continue cooperating with leading product providers and credit funds raised in the first quarter were amounted to rmb22 1 billion up 67 year on year and 9 quarter on quarter on the asset management front the aum of credit products by the end of the first quarter stood at rmb38 8 billion while retaining existing products and counterparties we adopted newer strategies since the second half of 2018 delivering standardized bond funds and public abs funds all investing in publicly traded credit securities to increase the breadth of available products at present a complete credit product line has been established with rmb and u s dollar products flexible terms and stable return in 2019 we are focusing on both the scale and the performance of our bond portfolio fund and this strategy has been attracting increasing attention from both institutional and individual clients in terms of us dollars denominated bond and cash management funds we have developed the full product lines actively managed by gopher specifically our flagship us dollar global bond fund has ranked in the top 5 among its peers with respect to its performance since inception in august 2018 in terms of renminbi products by the end of the first quarter gopher s total aum in renminbi bond funds has exceeded rmb1 billion and its aum of cash management funds exceeded rmb5 billion we believe that in the future standardized bonds will become an important portfolio asset for individual investors and we re fully prepared in this regard foreign language in terms of real estate bonds by the end of the first quarter of 2019 aum of gopher real estate investment reached rmb17 4 billion up 46 year over year in retrospect gopher s real estate preferred share funds which were mainly funds raised in the second half of last year has exceeded rmb4 billion in scale and has invested in 15 projects as of the end of the first quarter meanwhile projects invested and managed through our core asset acquisition fund are still operating soundly the occupancy rate of the office building and commercial properties in shanghai gopher center reached 95 and 100 respectively gopher s shanghai plaza will also be reported for official completion in june 2019 against the background of the continuous inflows of foreign capital to acquire china s core assets as well as gradual transition of china s real estate industry from an incremental market to a stock market our extensive experience in real estate investments as well as operation and management are showing their value foreign language from the first quarter of 2019 we officially changed the name of the strategy other investment under gopher s aum to multi strategic investments which represent our progress and achievements in promoting discretionary multi asset funds and family office businesses by the end of the first quarter the aum of gopher s multi strategic investment reached rmb6 9 billion up 92 year on year while attracting sustained client investments our full discretionary asset allocation capability has also won recognition by global professional institutions gopher asset was recently granted best wealth manager in china discretionary and segregated portfolio management by asian private banker as well as the insights mandates 2019 professional investment awards china multi asset strategy 3 years and global multi strategy 3 years foreign language in reviewing 2018 we believe that we now have an even better understanding of our client demands with a core competency that we have accumulated over the past 15 years in terms of product strategy we believe that in the long run it will ensure that bear market such as us market buy and hold the blue chip stocks is a suitable strategy for asset managers however emerging markets feature high volatility of individual stocks wide fluctuation ranges in stock price and rapid rise and collapse of valuation resulting in significant systematic risk therefore simply holding stocks is not the optimal wealth management strategy for emerging markets while the allocation strategy among multiple asset classes provides more due to sustainability our advantages stand out in the market competition in terms of the investment and allocation capabilities of relevant assets such as stocks equities bonds real estate asset backed securities cash management products and others foreign language finally i would like to talk briefly about the industry and regulation environment since 2019 china has continuously opened up the onshore financial market for foreign institutions to acquire financial licenses with increased competition from strong foreign peers domestic wealth management and asset management firms are facing both opportunities and challenges and we also believe that this trend will influence china s wealth management and asset management industries in several aspects first capital pools as implicit guarantees will no longer exist equity portfolio and net based products will gradually dominate the market and unlicensed non compliant institutions will be weeded out second investors will diverge without the protection of guaranteed return investors with low risk tolerance will have to leave the capital market and return to banks while more sophisticated investors will make long term investments in asset management products third the business models of wealth management and asset management institutions will transform from competition in licensed resources rules regulation and regulatory arbitrage to competition in investment management and marketing capabilities with the implementation of the new asset management guidelines that clarify direction of supervision and the continuous opening of financial service market to foreign investors china s asset management and wealth management industry are going toward healthier and more standardized development that is in line with international growth foreign language noah in 2019 we define our core businesses as wealth management asset management lending service insurance brokerage as well as global value added financial services for high net worth clients our objective is to keep sustained growth of clients and aum scale in the wealth management segment we will continue to build our capabilities to serve high net worth chinese in a global scope improve and optimize our relationship manager team and expand our client base in the asset management segment we will focus on improving our capabilities in multi asset allocation and provide comprehensive asset allocation services for high net worth and institutional clients meanwhile we re also seeking for external distribution channels for corporate asset management products to drive its multi dimensional growth currently gopher been included in the want list of several large size securities firms and banks in terms of providing more value added financial services we re mainly targeted in creating more client touch points and cross selling opportunities with a sustained dedication in 2019 we are confident in maintaining efficient operations and quality growth as always thank you all now i will turn the call over to our cfo shang to review our financial results in the first quarter shang chuang chief financial officer thank you chairlady we are pleased to report solid set of financial results for the first quarter of 2019 both net revenues and non gaap attributed income reached historic highs on a quarterly basis total net revenues were rmb889 9 million an increase of 7 1 year over year and non gaap attributable ordinary income was rmb304 6 million up 19 9 year over year in terms of revenue mix we achieved one time commissions in amount of rmb324 6 million up 2 1 from the same quarter last year and up 33 6 from the last quarter the strong sequential rebound was mainly contributed by an 11 4 quarter over quarter growth of transaction value reaching rmb28 billion as well as improvement of effective one time commission from 0 97 to 1 16 mainly contributed by the increased distribution of insurance products recurring service fees in the first quarter of 2019 were rmb420 6 million up 5 7 from the same period last year accounting for about half of total revenues the foreign based income of rmb4 9 million was significantly lower than the first quarter last year because most of the public securities products have not exceeded high watermark of last year and there were no significant exits by other products other service fees were rmb145 4 million primarily driven by our lending services business as well as the increased demands of value added services that we provide in the wealth management business in the first quarter total operating income increased 10 2 year over year to rmb302 5 million with operating efficiency enhancement measures our operating margin increased to 34 2 from 33 a year ago total compensation costs were rmb404 3 million up 12 1 year over year but down 5 6 quarter over quarter as we optimize dour employee base our selling expenses were rmb90 5 million down 14 9 year over year and down 13 7 quarter over quarter general and administrative expenses were also well controlled during the quarter the amount of rmb58 6 million represented a 4 7 increase year over year but 38 3 decrease quarter over quarter non gaap attributable net income for the first quarter was rmb304 6 million a strong increase of 19 9 year over year this quarter we adjusted out rmb29 6 million of share based compensation rmb8 7 million of gains from unrealized fair changes of equity securities and rmb5 7 million of tax effect of adjustments and adjusted rmb4 9 million of gains on sales of equity securities on the balance sheet side the company increased cash and cash equivalent by rmb165 million this quarter operating cash flow generated by core businesses remained strong at rmb152 7 million and in summary we continue to grow our business despite market uncertainty looking ahead we see huge potential in both wealth and asset management industries in china and we are dedicated to creating value for our clients as well as shareholders with that let s open up the call for questions operator questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question is from edward du with deutsche bank please go ahead edward du deutsche bank analyst hi thanks management team for taking my question this is edward from deutsche bank i have two small questions first question is about just so you re active clients increased by around 49 year on year but the total transaction value was up only 1 in first quarter making the average transaction decline by around 32 year on year and my question is about may we know is there any transaction behavior change among your client base or any reason behind this and my second question is about the distribution fee and based on my calculation your distribution fee rate came around 120 bps in first quarter but we do not see any meaningful change in your product distribution mix in fourth quarter compared to full fourth quarter last year and i mean we know any pricing structure change especially in the fixed income product and the secondary market products and that s all my questions thank you shang chuang chief financial officer yes sure thank you i will answer both of your questions so the first question regarding active client transaction value as well as average transaction value per active client so for the first quarter of 2019 one of our strategy was actually to activate or get more of our client base to transact on product and we were able to do so by broadening the type of product that we have conversations with clients and in the first quarter versus last year fy 2018 we engaged clients with mutual funds and we feel that by broadening our asset category to include public securities or wider categories of public security we can engage deeper with our clients and that i think works quite well and so going forward i think both on the wealth management side and asset management side we see opportunities for us to deepen wallet share by expanding into public securities okay so that s for your first question regarding your second question is yes for the first quarter of 2019 effective one time commission rate was up meaningfully to around 1 16 this is up year over year as well as quarter over quarter i think there are two main reasons so the amount of insurance distribution for the first quarter were actually quite robust in addition among the credit products that we distributed for the first quarter 2019 and a portion of it was more longer term fixed income products and for longer term fixed income product we were able to achieve the revenue upfront so those are the two main reasons why we saw effective bundling commission rate is up but it s still within a very long term range of 80 to 100 basis point and so the change is mainly because of product mix rather than any structural trend going forward edward du deutsche bank analyst thank you operator the next question is from george cai with jpmorgan please go ahead george cai jpmorgan analyst hi thank you for taking my question and congratulations on management for the results i have two questions the first one is on the private equity sales as we can see from the first quarter i think the private equity product sales has been quite weak as well compared to the last quarter and on a year over year basis so can you share with us more color on potentially when pe sales could rebound so that s my first question my second question is relating to the lending and other business as we can see the revenue growth has been very robust and we achieved a very sizable profit but then we want to ask on the loan book what s the current status of the asset quality and any what s the provision ratio and i understand this is more for internal clients lending but just want to ask you if we have cooperated with other banks on the core lending side so these are my two questions shang chuang chief financial officer sure for the first question regarding private equity may i allow madam wang to speak about that and then i ll answer george on second question regarding our lending business jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language chuang shang chuang chief financial officer yes so yes i ll translate madam wang to answer for the first question so regarding the new fund raising for private equity overall in the market is still quite soft it s mainly regarding the pace of exits by previous funds as we see in the market general capital market activity has been sluggish in terms of new ipo and new exits but we do see a silver lining as top tier gps are still able to exit they are very top our portfolio companies so our strategy in terms of private equity continues to be focusing on top tier plan our private fund business as well as expanding the amount of co investment and direct investment and so we believe our focus will allow us to capture growth opportunity in private equity on the long term in the short term challenges and difficulties is mainly regarding investors being reluctant to make a very long term investment versus hedge funds or public security given there are still a bit of uncertainty in terms of the macro environment so that s madam wang s response to your first question regarding the second question regarding our lending success madam wang just want to add some high level comments that the lending business she believes is an important complementary business to our wealth management business in terms of our high net worth individuals using financial products will look ph to achieve to obtain short term loan which is it should be synergistic to both of our core businesses now specifically regarding george s question on terms of some of the metrics for our loan business if you people can take a look at our balance sheet as of the end of the first quarter the loan receivables that s on our book is around rmb507 million ok now i want to take this opportunity perhaps to describe the way our lending business works so we would originate loans to our high net worth individuals and most of the time they would have high quality collateral and the average duration is around 9 to 12 months after we originate these loans we will sell or securitize these loan receivable so then they are sold to investors we continue to serve as a servicing agent in terms of the collection and the passing of interest and principal but we re no longer liable for the financial risk so it s in general it s a asset light business if you may in terms of the loans that we are servicing it s roughly about rmb10 billion so for the loans on our book actually we have 1 npl provision but historically the last 2 3 years we have not seen any meaningful default the main reason is because of a high quality of the board as well as the soundness of the collateral that we have when we make that loan when we make those loans thank you jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer operator operator yes sorry the next question is from stephanie poon with citi please go ahead stephanie poon citi analyst hi management team thanks for taking my questions so the first question is regarding your core domain ph of your audit strategy so we understand that like traditionally the alternative products has been your core strengths like for example on the private equity or some loans on the credit side so as you now expanding into this standardized credit products for these mutual funds it seems to be a more competitive area that we see a lots of other traditional banks are focusing also over in these products so can you share with us more about that what you see as your competitive edge here on these standardized products and also as you like expand into this product categories does it also means that you you re penetrating into maybe a lower tier client base and the second part second question is regarding your asset management distribution channels you mentioned earlier that you are expanding into some lower distribution channels can you share with us like any specific channels that you have currently and what is the percentage exposure there and also in terms of the position of this asset management business going forward i guess in the past we used to understand as more as supplementary for your whole wealth management products business to serve your existing high net work individual clients but going forward should we see it as maybe more staying along although business segments that you also expanding into some like external time based so that s my all of my questions thank you shang chuang chief financial officer thank you stephanie just for the benefit of my colleagues who are also on the phone i ll just perhaps just quickly summarize the three questions you raised one is regarding our public securities products specifically mutual fund how that will impact our business second is regarding gopher asset financing asset management s expansion into non noah distribution channels and third is asset position going forward i will answer these three questions and see if madam wang and mr zhao have anything to add so regarding your first question as you know and many of our shareholders are aware noah has been and will continue to be a firm believer of asset allocation over the last 10 years 12 years we have consistently expanded in terms of the product category and investment strategies that we are able to offer and manage for our clients because we believe a true diversified asset allocation is the best way for high net worth individual to ride through capital market volatility and we believe mutual fund should be an important aspect of their toolbox or an important tool in the toolbox and if you look at leading private bank for example ubs their high net worth individuals have 20 to 40 allocation in mutual fund so specifically on this particular strategy is actually in line with our long term strategy of deepening client wallet share rather than us expanding into mass retail so i just want to clarify in terms of our approach toward the mutual funds how do we get more of our existing clients wallet share how do we have or engage more client to transact with us so that s the reply for number one and trying number 2 as ms wang mentioned for gopher i think we have always been seeking ways to broaden the capital sources for gopher we have had some success with large insurance companies but we also see opportunities as gopher established more track record as well as expertise across investment strategy and most recently we have very good progress in terms of mid to large size securities firms in terms of become getting on their preferred list in terms of distributing gopher s public securities product i e kind of hedge fund or others and quantify it and we see as the capital market continue to develop in china we want gopher to be able to grow its aun from all these different sources i guess it s tied to your third question in terms of the long term positioning of gopher i think a very good example would be globally we see a lot of private bank when in these early stages will incubate an asset manager but as the asset management grows and expand its business it s become quite fairly independent i e their capital sources comes from institutions come from other distributors a reference is i believe that and when i spoke with my peers at ubs asset management about 20 to 30 of their capital comes from ubs private bank i e more than half 70 comes from non ubs private banking sources and i think that is a good role model or an example of what gopher can achieve as madam wang mentioned in her prepared remarks and we continue to believe so asset management in china is still very early days if we use a baseball analogy probably only in the second third innings and as the future growth potential it s quite huge for gopher and i believe madam wang technical difficulty i believe madam wang has things to add as well foreign language jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer foreign language shang chuang chief financial officer yeah so let me translate madam wang s commentary on the question so for gopher since establishment in 2010 over the last nearly decade i think we have accumulated expertise in the various investment strategies that we operate in and most unfortunately we have now seen the benefits of being an actor ph in terms of asset allocation and diversified solution provider what this means to our investors is delivering low volatility as wage ph and investments strategies have low correlation to each other now we will continue to expand gopher based on inaudible co investment and direct investment with the goal and intention delivering absolute return to investors and we believe we re able to do so by executing on a multi strategy efforts now based on various data that we have accumulated over the years as well as recent conversation and surveys with our clients we believe that we are very well positioned to be the leaving leading brand for multi strategy in china and in terms on the asset manager for alternatives so now adding some comments on our expansion into public security again i want to emphasize this is part of our asset allocation approach it s not aiming to expand into new a client segmentation but rather how do we use new tools to cross sell to existing high net worth clients now for the first quarter i think we had some efforts in terms of mutual fund fundraising and historically we have done a mutual fund on the asset management basis so we are actually quite familiar with this asset category and for some of the funds that we were focused on fund raising in the first quarter the fund raising side that we achieved is actually similar to some of the mid to large banks and the bank and this just shows that the potential of our clients in terms of this asset category the average transaction per client for the mutual fund for our client because much higher than bank now we are confident in terms of getting non noah channels or distributor to specifically ph gopher asset as shang mentioned there are a lot of asset management firms globally that we have originated from wealth management roots but has grown to be very sizable and their reliance on their existing private banking partner with own is now only 10 to 20 so in other words as gopher develops the potential from non noah channel should be even larger than the amount coming from noah currently today jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer operator operator yes our next question is from yuan xue with cicc please go ahead yuan xue cicc analyst foreign language shang chuang chief financial officer yes for the benefit of the audience i will translate the question from the research analyst from cicc so i know from the quarterly disclosure the company has for the first time disclosed segmentation by geographic location and we see for the first quarter 2019 revenue coming from others or other region has made good progress and if you can give us more color on that and so i ll comment on this question and see if my colleagues have anything to add but over the last few years and we continue to express our view to the capital market is that we want to build a global business and since the establishment of the hong kong business in 2012 we have continued to make good progress as of the first quarter of 2019 our overseas markets have contributed roughly about 25 of total revenue and over the next 3 year to 5 year we continue we want to continue to grow that percentage now as you know we set up our this is in the us roughly about 2 5 years to go both in silicon valley and new york both of these offices and the team are focused in terms of product sourcing and developing products and so we re now able to offer vc fund investment opportunities co investment and direct investment opportunity as well as u s insurance products to our clients and so it s an example of how we replicate our success in hong kong to other large capital market or large markets elsewhere in the world we believe our clients are becoming more mobile and global so and definitely in terms of building a global presence will benefit us in the long term operator our next question is from george cai with jpmorgan please go ahead george cai jpmorgan analyst yeah hi thank you for i have a follow up question i think on the net profit there is quite a large gap between the gaap net profit and non gaap profit a large chunk of it i think it s related to the gain unrealized gains from the fair value changes of equity securities so could you add more color on this and going forward do you expect the volatilities could be smaller thank you shang chuang chief financial officer yeah thank you george for the question if you note on page 17 of our 6 k or quarterly disclosure we break out the details of our gaap net income and non gaap net income the largest adjustments actually share based comp which is quite in line with how other let s say company define non gaap net income and part of it the other part of the adjustment comes from fair value changes of equity securities are unrealized and you can define this or interpret this as basically mark to market of equity securities that we hold and the market has been a bit volatile and so we adjust out those noises and then we add back in a realized gain and there is a detailed breakout so i won t read the numbers one by one yeah jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer operator operator this concludes the question and answer session and today s conference call you may disconnect your lines thank you for participating and have a pleasant day duration 73 minutes call participants shang chuang chief financial officer yi zhao group president jingbo wang co founder chairman and chief executive officer edward du deutsche bank analyst george

bitcoin pulls ahead of the pack during the cryptocurrency boom of 2017 when the price of a bitcoin rose from less than 800 to almost 20 000 it seemed as if not a week went by that another digital currency wasn t being created by someone somewhere of course many if not most were dodgy ventures thought up by profiteers looking to capitalize on the boom and exploit the greater fool theory of markets but some legitimate cryptocurrencies were created and although the market has largely suffered since those heady days of 2017 the market is making a bit of a comeback with the bloomberg galaxy crypto index rising 83 this year but still some 32 below its all time high what s interesting about the move is that it s not being led by one of the newcomers but by bitcoin which is up 121 this year bitcoin has been around the longest and its performance this year shows that investors in this market are putting their faith in cryptocurrencies that have stood the test of time and proved their worth after a series of scandals and fraud schemes fidelity investments will buy and sell the world s most popular digital asset for institutional customers soon according to a person familiar with the matter
on thursday morning as walmart delivered a stark warning that donald trump s widening trade war with china would lead to higher prices for american consumers john flynn stood in front of one of the us retailer s stores in virginia defiantly defending the us president i think he s doing the right thing america is becoming very dependent on stuff from china said flynn a 55 year old real estate agent who grew up in the steel country of western pennsylvania if prices go up prices go up it s going to hurt them in the long run too so it s just a matter of who blinks first he said as he stepped into his honda accord read more trump tells advisers he will not de escalate trade war timeline the long road to a us china trade deal flynn s words from the parking lot in manassas near the site of the first major land battle of the american civil war will give trump comfort that he can prevail in the biggest economic gamble of his presidency two weeks ago he balked at an agreement that was coming together to reset trade relations with china accusing officials in beijing of reneging on their commitments instead trump moved to impose billions of dollars in new tariffs on chinese goods and threatened to slap on even more as early as late june raising the stakes for the global economy financial markets and his own political future heading into the 2020 election season us and chinese officials insist that negotiations have not broken down entirely and trump has said he will meet xi jinping the chinese president next month at the g20 summit in japan stoking expectations that a downward spiral in relations can be avoided us and chinese officials insist that negotiations have not broken down entirely photo 123rf but the odds of a quick settlement are fading raising the prospect of a protracted commercial stand off between the world s largest economies when the us this week launched an attack on huawei the chinese telecommunications company by placing it on an export blacklist that could severely damage its business it further raised fears of an enduring confrontation this represents a material escalation in tensions with the chinese government we have truly crossed the rubicon chris krueger an analyst at cowen washington research group said following the huawei announcement the kissinger consensus is dead and china is a strategic rival full stop trump s bet is that the american economy with unemployment at half century lows and us gross domestic product expanding at an annualised 3 2 per cent in the first quarter of the year can withstand the pain from the trade war with china the fact that us growth held firm even after past rounds of tariffs sent tremors through financial markets emboldened the president to take a tougher line in the talks with china but unless a deal is reached soon the us economy will bear the brunt of the new and higher tariffs which will act as an extra tax on a wide gamut of products from construction materials to farm equipment and electronics analysts at oxford economics estimate that if a 25 per cent tariff is extended to all of china s exports to the us it could deliver a 0 5 per cent knock to the level of american gdp next year consumers particularly low income americans and the elderly on fixed retirement packages would begin to feel the effects of the trade conflict as tariffs drive up costs lifting inflation chase rice the owner of a family run hardware store in manassas has been on the front lines of the china trade war for months and keeping up with higher prices imposed by vendors has been a big challenge it s not a 2 3 per cent hike he says there are 5 10 per cent plus hikes on things you can t absorb that it s definitely something you have to pass along trade rivals donald trump and xi jinping in beijing december 2017 photo getty images nathan sheets a former top us treasury official who is now chief economist at pgim fixed income says the us has enough momentum to absorb the trade tensions and is in a better place than many other economies but he sees significant downside risks one worry shared by many analysts is that a major escalation in the us china stand off could deliver a blow to financial market confidence as well as corporate and consumer optimism while the federal reserve might feel compelled to respond with easier policy if there were a major sell off in markets the central bank has relatively limited monetary firepower at its disposal the bigger concern is the longer term damage the trade wars could cause businesses have already been disrupted as they weigh supply chain shifts out of china raising fears that the two intertwined economies are headed towards a decoupling read more us china trade war leaves global economy counting the cost donald trump says china tariffs help not hurt the us trump s hardball trade tactic a sign that china truce is near curtailing competition and closing down overseas markets will only harm the us economy says mary lovely of the peterson institute for international economics he seems to be getting away with it but in the longer run there will be a price to pay she says we will look back and say it slowed down us innovation and us growth jason furman former chairman of barack obama s council of economic advisers says he did not believe the pay off for the us of any future trade deal with china was sufficient to justify trump s strategy but he adds anyone counting on a dramatic deterioration in the macro economic numbers to bring an end to the us side of this is likely to be disappointed the blow to china would be greater if all of its exports to the us are taxed at 25 per cent in part whereas the us exported us 120 billion 183 9b of goods to china last year china is far more reliant on the us shipping us 540b of goods to the us the hit in 2020 to chinese gdp which has already shown some weakness in recent months would be 1 3 per cent under this scenario says greg daco chief us economist of oxford economics us trade representative robert lighthizer says correcting certain chinese trade practices is a fundamental objective of the us photo getty images domestic economic activity has lost some momentum which is not promising as the economy girds for a prolonged and intensifying trade war with the us says eswar prasad a professor at cornell university and former head of the international monetary fund s china division but china has room to add further stimulus says matthew goodman senior asian economics adviser of the center for strategic and international studies i would not bet on them either caving or losing more in the event of a broader trade war he adds while china would not welcome the prospect of a prolonged trade war analysts believe the communist party s control over everything from the renminbi s dollar exchange rate to the state dominated banking system will help it prevail attitudes are also hardening across the chinese bureaucracy as one semi official social media account used to channel beijing s anger put it after trump s latest salvo we do not want a fight but are not afraid of one to safeguard national dignity and our core interests adding insult to injury in the minds of party officials trump announced his decision to escalate the trade war on the same weekend that beijing was celebrating the 100th anniversary of the may 4 movement a patriotic student uprising against the decision to award germany s colonies in china to japan at the end of the first world war on both tuesday and friday evening this week a leading china central television channel rejigged its line up to broadcast two classic movies about the korean war the 1950s conflict is known in china as the war to resist us aggression and assist korea since the talks hit a brick wall earlier this month trump has both tried to belittle the trade war with china calling it a little squabble while dismissing the impact on american consumers but his administration has been scrambling to limit the fallout by promising a second multibillion dollar bailout of us farmers hit by retaliatory tariffs from china although many us lawmakers have embraced trump s trade war there is unrest among some of his closest republican allies a fox news poll released this week showed that 45 per cent of americans believe raising tariffs on china will hurt the economy while 34 per cent said it would help but there are not many signs that the us administration is feeling huge pressure to back away in a briefing with reporters this month us trade representative robert lighthizer suggested the status quo in trade between the us and china established since beijing joined the wto in 2001 was far more damaging than anything emanating from the tariffs because of the theft of us intellectual property and rampant subsidies the placing of huawei on an export blacklist raised fears of an enduring confrontation between the us and china photo 123rf the practices that we are objecting to by china are having a very negative effect on the us economy now and in the future and getting those corrected is just a fundamental objective of this president lighthizer said hawks in the trump administration believe that the longer the stand off continues the more it will encourage us companies to keep stop doing business with china their ultimate goal but back at the manassas walmart many are unconvinced that trump s trade war will be healthy for the us economy i can see why we need to push back on china i just don t think what we are doing is the appropriate way to do it

transition away from coal 4 climate change 5 water 6 energy 7 unemployment and low wages 8 affordable housing 9 health 10 education 11 other comments 1 economics sir david attenborough said we have a finite environment the planet anyone who thinks that you can have infinite growth in a finite environment is either a madman or an economist what s your opinion on the current economic model of endless growth is it sustainable and if so how fiona leviny independent we must strengthen the pursuit of sustainable growth ensuring that what is taken out of the natural resources of the earth can be replenished and stopping those activities that have no balance in return the enhanced sourcing of energy from renewables is a prime example of such sustainability albert einstein framed human activity in another way the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results alison waters animal justice party it is abundantly clear that an economic system which promotes unbridled growth is unsustainable for our planet and its inhabitants peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party this obsession with endless economic growth demonstrates that societies still do not understand that humanity has exceeded ecological limits and that this is the root cause of the current environmental crisis nasa states that there are 40 billion earth sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun like stars and red dwarfs in the milky way 11 billion of which may be orbiting sun like stars but will we make the same environmental mistakes with these new earths daniel reid the greens i agree wholeheartedly with sir attenborough in his assessment of the infinite growth model infinite growth is unsustainable and our economy needs to transition to a renewable future kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor when we look back on this election we will see that it was a turning point for our environment did australia become part of the solution or did we continue with the division and chaos on climate and energy from the liberals and nationals they have held back our tackling of climate change they have also cut us off from the sustainable economic growth of the future which lies in us embracing renewable energy and the clean green jobs of a sustainable low carbon economy 2 biodiversity loss and extinction are you concerned with the recent un scientific report ipbes which documents the unprecedented decline in global biodiversity the authors claim there are alarming implications for human health prosperity and long term survival if concerned with the report how will you work towards improving biodiversity and reversing mass extinctions fiona leviny independent i am alarmed and very concerned who couldn t be biodiversity is critical to our future sustainable food supply and agriculture is a key source the awareness raising around the decline of bees for example is a key trigger in a chain of potentially disastrous impact not only for all humanity but also animals and all other beings on this planet we must elevate the recognition and respect for our scientists the experts in this field who of us know that we have eight australians nobel prize winners in physiology and medicine i will ensure the significant raising of funding and focus in this area as the ipbes report states while more food energy and materials than ever before are now being supplied to people in most places this is increasingly at the expense of nature s ability to provide such contributions in the future and frequently undermines nature s many other contributions which range from water quality regulation to sense of place the biosphere upon which humanity as a whole depends is being altered to an unparalleled degree across all spatial scales biodiversity the diversity within species between species and of ecosystems is declining faster than at any time in human history alison waters animal justice party it deeply concerns and dismays me that one million species on earth are at threat of extinction it is inconceivable it has been predicted that koalas could become extinct in the wild in nsw by 2050 the animal justice party wants an immediate halt to logging in native forests the protection of existing forests and marine habitats and the reforestation and re wilding of land wherever possible globally the animal agriculture industry is the leading cause of species loss it is a major cause of habitat loss and land clearing peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party although there are no silver bullets or one size fits all answers the best options would seem to be in better governance integrating biodiversity concerns into sectoral policies and practices eg agriculture and energy the application of scientific knowledge and technology increased awareness and behavioural changes also indigenous and local knowledge can be an invaluable asset and biodiversity issues need to receive much higher priority in policy making and development planning at every level cross border collaboration is also essential given that biodiversity challenges recognise no national boundaries daniel reid the greens habitat loss and climate change are the two greatest threats to the biodiversity of the planet if elected the greens are committed to seeing the end of native flora clearing and a dramatic increase in the money spent on re vegetating the country mass extinctions can only be avoided if we immediately set the target for renewable to 100 per cent by 2030 to mitigate the worst effects of climate change kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor it is a disgrace that australia is the extinction capital of the world labor has committed to a comprehensive set of policies to fight extinction and undo years of neglect from the abbott turnbull morrison government we will reform environmental laws establish an environment protection agency establish an 100 million extinction fund and we will increase the role and authority of indigenous rangers in land management we will take up the fight at an international level as well a space that the liberals and nationals have vacated we will work with other like minded countries to protect biodiversity and our oceans fight threats such as marine pollution plastics and sea bed mining and we will ratify international heritage conventions 3 transition away from coal what transition plan are you supporting to move coal miners workers and towns away from coal to other forms of employment fiona leviny independent long term planning is required for transition of large single industry dependant workers families and associated industries the introduction of regional tax zones at personal income and business tax level drawing business and government to regional and rural areas requiring enhanced employment will be one way to approach the opportunities for employment as coal production declines in traditional coal mining areas effective transition is critical we need a clear transition policy to renewable energy to recognise our current fossil fuel dependency is impacting climate change we must stop the current debate and get on with recognising science to achieve policy alison waters animal justice party it is imperative that workers in the coal industry be provided with financial support education and training in order transition into sustainable and climate friendly industries this is the responsibility of governments across the country we have an obligation to support these workers into genuine employment peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party it needs to be a just transition viz people at the centre of the process a long term strategy and a democratic process respect for mining heritage embracing a truly social dimension supporting a healthier environment creating more sustainable business opportunities daniel reid the greens the greens fully support a transition program for communities and people who rely on coal excavation and burning training programs for effected workers and renewable projects in manufacturing for effected towns is part of our commitment to keep people in work throughout the transition to a renewable economy kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor despite years of climate denial and delay from the coalition labor is clear eyed about the need to transition to a low carbon economy we know we need to plan for the new opportunities that our renewable energy future will bring unlike the liberals and nationals who have a track record of abandoning communities when a coal fired power station closes labor will ensure that people are not left behind by this inevitable transition as many of our ageing coal fired power stations reach the end of their technical life and renewables get cheaper every day labor will implement a long term plan to ensure workers are supported and are first in line for new job opportunities this includes a 10 million clean energy training fund to train workers in fields like solar panel and battery installation and energy management part of our tafe package is to make sure workers have access to critical training and re training in a range of skill shortage areas where workers are desperately needed labor will also invest in a just transition authority to oversee economic diversification plans in impacted regions and manage pooled redundancy schemes that power stations and coal mines will be required to participate in all large generators will also be required to provide at least three year notice of closure ensuring the best planning can be put in place for the workers and their families 4 climate change do you believe and support the ipcc statements that we have 12 now 11 5 years to decarbonise and stabilise the world s atmosphere if yes how are you going to create change if you are elected fiona leviny independent i am no scientist but there is overwhelming evidence from experts in this field such as those with the ipcc and many other institutions i have made it clear in public statements and at meet the candidates forums that there is a climate emergency we must act now the effective transition to renewable sources for energy the transition out of fossil fuel based power moving from dirtier forms of fossil fuel energy such as coal to cleaner forms with renewables the outcome and economic technology enhanced supported and developed alongside research groups such as the school of photovoltaic and renewable energy engineering and emeritus professor maria skyllas kazacos s work on vanadium batteries at unsw are leading the global field of r d in this area we need to support development at all levels we need our government to recognise the human impact on climate change and move to forming policies population growth our needs for survival communication transport and security is affecting the climate this debate around the existence of climate change needs to come to an end from our leaders most global businesses including fossil fuel companies accept and recognise the impact their activities have had on the environment our governing bodies need to do the same we must demand that our government accept the human impact on climate change to make responsible policies for future generations to come alison waters animal justice party i am concerned that we have less than 12 years we are facing a climate emergency every system of our society will be impacted by unpredictable and extreme weather taking urgent action on climate change is a priority of the animal justice party we acknowledge that animal agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change we would support farmers to transition to sustainable climate friendly and plant based farming by providing incentives including training and financial support the ajp is opposed to any expansion of the fossil fuel industry and supports investment in renewables we would protect natural habitats and set renewable energy targets peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party the ipcc statements mentions that even if we cut most of our carbon emissions down to zero emissions from agriculture and air travel would be difficult to eliminate altogether and since carbon dioxide that s already in the atmosphere can affect climate for hundreds to thousands of years the ipcc maintains that carbon dioxide removal cdr technologies will be critical to get rid of 100 to 1000 gigatonnes of co2 this century there are various methods to remove carbon from the atmosphere and each have its pros and cons viz afforestation and reforestation soil carbon sequestration bioenergy with carbon capture and storage beccs a great future industry for page carbon mineralization direct air capture enhanced weathering ocean fertilization and coastal blue carbon etc each cdr technology is feasible at some level but has uncertainties about cost technology the speed of possible implementation or environmental impacts it s clear that no single one provides the ultimate solution to climate change daniel reid the greens yes the planet is at a crisis point of the climate change era if elected i would move immediately to remove subsidies for the unprofitable fossil fuel mining and processing corporations and give that money to renewable industry and training grants for workers who are negatively effected kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor it is crazy that this question still has to be asked whatever kevin hogan says the liberals and nationals that he shares a 100 per cent identical voting record with have paralysed australia with their inability to admit that climate change is real or provide any leadership on climate and energy labor knows the clock is ticking and we will deliver the leadership to cut carbon pollution to protect our environment grow jobs and or economy and deal with more extreme weather like droughts and floods with natural disasters already costing the economy 18 billion a year labor is committed to reducing australia s pollution by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero pollution by 2050 we are also committed to 50 per cent renewable energy in our electricity mix by 2030 5 water is a significant issue and precious resource in australia what are your key points to address the issue of water stability and management in the country will you ensure that the health of all rivers will take primary need over corporate irrigation and big business fiona leviny independent water storage and infrastructure planning needs to happen not just be talked about we must be courageous and look to examples of our history such as the snowy hydro scheme this project alone brought economic water and power security and social cultural benefits to our nation we need federal policies that are transparent and fair to ensure our economic and environmental well being today and for future generations the current drought has and will continue to shape the economic and emotional stability of our nation we need a permanent fund for disasters that can be tapped into instantly as required rather than waiting for legislation the health of our rivers is critical to all of our well being and we must act federally and across artificially created lines on our natural environment by state boundaries water should not be treated as some financially tradeable commodity used by financial institutions to make profits water should only be for the productive and environmentally sound use in agriculture and in balancing water stream and environmental flows alison waters animal justice party it is imperative that our precious life giving water is protected for humans and animals and that the interests and profits of corporate irrigators and big business are not prioritised over the health and longevity of water systems peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party there is an important and urgent need to abolish the murray darling basin plan to return the once iconic river system to a healthy sustainable and functional condition all water resources need to be protected from corporate misuse and natural disaster actions can be taken to prevent water scarcity and instability from becoming a vicious cycle by focusing on sustainable efficient and equitable water resources management and service delivery addressing water and fragility challenges requires a move from a focus primarily on immediate reactive responses to a balanced long term approach this approach would build growth oriented resilience to shocks and protracted crises focused on sustainable efficient and equitable water resources management and service delivery daniel reid the greens water is life and in australia we need to get real about how we manage our water clean water should be seen as a human right and if we manage it well then communities could be guaranteed clean and safe drinking water the rivers of our country have been destroyed by mining and agribusiness irrigators water should be quarantined for environmental flows and human use before serving the profits of a few wealthy business owners kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor no response 6 energy what are your plans to provide stability for investment into renewable energy and the closing of polluting sources of energy fiona leviny independent per above the effective transition to renewable sources for energy the transition out of fossil fuel based power moving from dirtier forms of fossil fuel energy such as coal to cleaner forms with renewables the outcome and economic technology enhanced supported and developed alongside most global businesses including fossil fuel companies accept and recognise the impact their activities have had on the environment our governing bodies need to do the same we must demand that our government accept the human impact on climate change to make responsible policies for future generations to come alison waters animal justice party the ajp recommends that there should be no new expansion of natural gas use whether from coal seam or other sources we support a rapid phase out in favour of clean energy technologies the ajp supports a climate tax on the fossil fuel industries using the principle that the polluter pays the ajp supports investment in known clean technologies and a rapid transition to carbon free energy infrastructure peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party the renewable energy market is about to enter its most crucial moment yet the industry has had everything it needs to flourish so far with government subsidies providing projects with a safety net and record low interest rates providing the cheap debt that is integral to funding renewable energy projects which demand very high upfront capital costs if renewable energy is to continue its rapid advancement then it needs a long term framework it can rely on we need new funding sources for shortening the start up cycle and broadening technology innovation besides enabling new manufacturing techniques to create products with higher electricity generation capabilities funding can rapidly advance the rate of innovation in areas as diverse as biofuels robotics and micro and smart grids at a minimum our goals need to 1 attract renewable energy investment and projects 2 built community support and 3 attracted and grow renewable energy expertise daniel reid the greens currently there are billions of dollars in subsidies going to the wealthiest mine owners in australia that money should be invested into renewable energy project to speed up the process of reaching 100 per cent renewables by 2030 any existing coal power plant should be put on a decommission schedule that includes replacement plans including batteries kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor when the liberals and nationals tossed out malcolm turnbull as their leader they confirmed that they have no plan to drive investment in reliable cheaper renewable energy the irony is that businesses in australia are they ones crying out for this leadership along with the rest of the country labor believes that renewable energy will power our future modelling released by the australia institute estimates that labor s plan for more renewable energy and cheaper power will generate up to 70 000 jobs by 2030 labor will continue to pursue a bipartisan market mechanism such as a national energy guarantee that will help us deliver our commitment of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 labor is prepared to work with the liberals but we will not wait for them we created the hugely successful clean energy finance corporation and will will provide an additional 10 billion to its capital this will support large scale generation and storage projects including solar and wind farms support labor s household battery program by providing concessional loans for the purchase of solar and battery systems and investment in energy efficiency projects commercial and community renewable energy projects and industrial transformation labor will also create an independent energy security and modernisation fund to provide 5 billion in capital to future proof our energy network building and upgrading australia s energy transmission and distribution systems this fund will help manage the transition to more renewables in our energy system ensuring households and businesses have the energy supply they need when they need it at affordable prices 7 unemployment and low wages the seat of richmond has high unemployment and low wages what are you planning do to address this issue fiona leviny independent we need certainty not policy promises or changes at election time small businesses must be assured certainty with no double taxing incentives for growth in regional australia need to be addressed via a tax system of regional tax rebates a regional tax zone rebate is needed for individuals and industry that will incentivise and motivate people to move to regional australia this needs to be significant enough to bring immediate economic growth infrastructure and jobs to our communities in regional australia alison waters animal justice party the climate emergency requires immediate action it is essential that the government harnesses this imperative to act by providing our communities with new employment opportunities in proven and emerging industries in the sectors of renewable energy and plant based agriculture peter walker christian democratic party fred nile group no response john mudge united australia party both economic growth real wages and skilled workers are influential in determining the rate of unemployment there is a compounding set of problems that push young people towards disengagement from the labour force and from education if the number of full time jobs for youth is falling and if young people are not taking up full time education and training places to improve their employment prospects then the duration of young people s unemployment rises then after stints of joblessness young people cease looking for work and when the benefits of education and training aren t obvious or when access to training places is poor because of geography or cost then young people leave the labour force and education there is a strong positive relationship between qualifications and access to full time employment policy that addresses young people s poor labour market outcomes must promote engagement in education and training however that education and training must not be in occupations which are vulnerable to unemployment dying careers while education and training is obviously the policy portfolio area that will do the most to solve the youth unemployment and disengagement problem labour market policy is also of major importance at a time when it is increasingly difficult to nominate the economic sectors most likely to generate rewarding careers there is surely a need to fashion labour markets in ways that improve young the foregoing need complementing by actions to improve public transport access housing affordability income support child care mental health measures and so on the united australia party supports a fast rail network to transform australia eg fast train to brisbane as well as linking regional centres to each other and sydney significantly slashing travel times across the state making regional travel faster safer and easier will bring huge economic potential to page daniel reid the greens people in page should be offered the same opportunities for employment as people who live in the major cities government investment into land rejuvenation should be increased so that there are reliable and sustainable jobs for every person that wants one other community services which have also been defunded and forced to lay off staff should be refunded to open up services and employment for our area kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor under the liberals and nationals everything has been going up except wages this community has been especially hard hit meanwhile the division and chaos of this government is holding back our economic progress and job creation including investing in education and training of our young people and embracing the clean renewable energy based economy of the future which will create millions of new jobs labor has a plan to get wages moving again and move more people into higher paying jobs via our investment in tafe universities and pre school for all we will reverse the cruel cuts to penalty rates which have hit the pay packets of retail hospitality pharmacy and fast food workers in our community kevin hogan thinks these penalty rate cuts are great for for our youth who is he kidding these cuts will pull more than 18 million from our economy in the next three years and while this reckless policy has inflected real harm on hardworking people it has not created any jobs don t take out word for it that is according to the business council of australia labor will ensure that the minimum wage is a living wage fixing the law so that the fair work commission has the tools to deliver a living wage for australia s lower paid workers that will also boost the economy a fair go for australia means a fair wage for working people labor s living wage policy will directly benefit around 1 2 million australians or one in 10 workers 8 affordable housing there is an affordable

homeless people and families needing basic bedding and shelter the largest jail in australia is currently under construction in the page electorate with no plans for accommodation for families of many

required funding for affordable housing in fast growing regional centres needed tax and other subsidies required to ensure transitions do not have major gaps with broader community impact alison waters animal justice party i support the expansion of social and affordable housing as a society we must also address the issues that contribute to housing instability and homelessness such as intimate partner violence family violence youth unemployment and lack of community based mental health services i support the expansion of rental and housing subsidies for people on low incomes and

taxation 20 tax discount individuals living working 200 kms from state capital ease congestion in cities decentralise australia grow the regions jobs affordable housing infrastructure wealth creation lifestyle enrichment revitalise the great australia dream drive affordable housing home ownership increased disposable income via tax refund to pay off home loan quicker stimulate the economy drive growth and feed consumption which will insulate us against future recessions and gfc and use increased gst collected to support jobs schools hospitals infrastructure higher standard of living home loan interest tax deductible individuals builds on the benefits of zonal taxation see above also the uap brains trust is also aware that the affordable housing sector is being denied access to the scale of equity capital necessary to address housing shortages sure banks will lend them debt finance for a price but that has to be repaid on commercial terms the missing link in this policy chain is the provision of an efficient and effective mechanism to deliver equity capital to affordable housing providers that is affordable housing tax credits are the missing link such a policy would provide the means to allow institutional investors effectively to write down or write off every dollar they ever invest in a sector with no adverse impact on their rate of return benchmarks daniel reid the greens the greens have a plan to build 500 000 low income public and emergency houses to get homeless and vulnerable australians into a safe home from which they can participate in society kevin hogan the nationals no response patrick deegan labor there is a real choice on housing in this election do we maintain the billions in expensive and unsustainable capital gains and negative gearing tax loopholes for property investors or do we level the playing field so that more young people and families can buy their own home and so there is more affordable housing built in australia the reality in australia is that there are record numbers of families experiencing homelessness and mortgage stress the current tax concessions on property need reform and labor is the only party that can deliver this reform it is important to understand that people who already negatively gear an investment can keep that concession and will be unaffected people who currently get a capital gains tax discount on their investment can keep that and we will keep negative gearing for anyone who wants to invest in new build properties because that will help increase our housing stock and the stick of homes for rent labor s plan will restrict negative gearing to new homes from 1 january 2020 and we halve the capital gains tax discount for all assets purchased after 1 january 2020 labor has also committed to having a national housing strategy in government this includes increasing the stock of affordable rental properties by 250 000 the largest federal investment in housing since the second world war we will encourage more institutional investors into the housing by revamping the build to rent scheme giving institutional investors better tax concessions to encourage more construction labor will also provide 88 million over two years for a new safe housing fund to provide more transitional housing for women and children escaping domestic and family violence young people exiting out of home care and older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness 9 health do you believe in free health care for all australians fiona leviny independent all australians should have the right to equal and quality medical care no matter where you live we must have a government that is confident to ensure policies are set for generations to come and off limits to future campaigning a discounted medicare levy for rural and regional people is required we cannot just walk or drive around the corner for high quality medical care like communities in the cities alison waters animal justice party

medicare card not your creditcard should be what determines your health care we will put 8 billion into our health system 8 billion more than the liberals and nationals this includes our medicare cancer plan the most significant investment in medicare since it was created a 2 3 billion investment in addressing out of pocket costs of cancer cheaper specialist appointments cheaper scans cheaper medicines one in two of us will face a cancer diagnosis by the time we are 85 in a prosperous country like australia people should not have to go into debt when they are in the fight of their life we will also invest 2 4 billion in giving pensioners access to critical dental care we will reverse morrison s cuts to hospitals including the 2 8 billion cut he is locking in to public hospitals up to 2025 this means an additional 313m for nsw regional hospitals and 2 4 million for lismore base hospital we see that regional emergency departments particularly are at breaking point and elective surgery waiting times are the longest on record under the liberals and nationals so our public hospital system desperately needs labor s investment 10 education do you believe in free education for

3 and 4 year old in australia 14 billion extra funding for our public schools 200 000 additional university places more apprenticeships and the rebuilding of public tafe in australia which has been gutted by the liberals and nationals for regional areas this means more teachers more access to specialist support for kids when they need it and more resources that city schools take for granted it also means more tafe courses and places for training our young people and re training workers in skill shortage areas and for the jobs of the future in tanya plibersek the shadow education minister we

no labor leader other than hawke 4 nil electoral win loss ratio has led his party to more than two electoral victories and none other than fisher 2 1 to more triumphs than defeats here i count the hung parliament of 2010 as a dead heat hawke s electoral record stands up alongside the durable conservative leaders menzies 7 5 1 5 if we count the hung parliament of 1940 as a tie the 3 0 of hughes and lyons two bolters from the labor side and howard s 4 2 hawke and curtin bob hawke admired john curtin and thought him australia s greatest prime minister in the march of the patriots paul kelly declares that the labor party has produced two great prime ministers john curtin and bob hawke the founders of two historic eras kelly 2009 p2 both hawke and curtin spent the whole of their professional lives before becoming prime minister in the politics of what was once called the labor movement both had to defeat problems with alcohol to be good prime ministers but the personal differences were more striking hawke s social and political confidence contrasts with curtin s diffidence with others and periodic depression curtin united the country around the war effort and the hopes of a better postwar australia hawke united the country around structural reform to modernise and open the economy and to integrate the economy and society productively into a newly dynamic asian neighbourhood or at least each united the country as far as can be imagined for one of the world s oldest most argumentative and raucous democracies public education and persuasion hawke s confidence became conviction that he could persuade the australian community to do hard things when the national interest required it electoral confidence underwrote long time perspectives on policy when hawke asked his cabinet to endorse politically difficult budgetary measures in the 1983 may statement that would take until the end of the decade to have their main effects he expected his government to be around to enjoy the benefits hawke s capacity to persuade australians of the value of difficult and sometimes painful changes stood alongside his view that public education on the nature of the problem was an essential part of a solution advertisement hawke presumed that most australians shared a commitment to their country beyond their narrow personal interests public education could help reconcile divergent views on contested policy reconciliation and consensus like public education were essential to durable reform of policy and institutions nelson mandela with hawke in 1990 peter cox hawke s truncated fourth term was as productive as any for reform with the march statement of 1991 in the depths of recession taking the largest and most important of all the steps to dismantle australia s long standing and damaging policy of protection in that fourth term co operation with premiers from both sides of australia s political divide was moving towards far reaching and productive reform of australia s federal arrangements while diminished by the struggle over leadership of the australian labor party it reached across the partisan political divide to generate what stands in history as a unique period of co operative federalism the move from centralised wage formation taken further by keating and much further and later a step too far by howard was commenced in the fourth term strong mind it was a rich professional experience and a great pleasure to work closely with bob hawke in various capacities throughout his prime ministership it has been my great pleasure in the years since 1991 from time to time and at length to discuss with hawke the challenges facing australia and the international community of which it is part he deployed one of the best informed disciplined retentive and analytically strong minds with which i have interacted if i was talking to the prime minister about budget policy or the resource rent tax or the launching of a new round of global trade negotiations or economic relations with the united states or india or china and we were interrupted by a security scandal or foreign relations emergency the discussion about economic policy would be put aside we would later resume the conversation exactly where we had left it each conversation built on a stronger base of knowledge and settled positions former finance minister peter walsh recollected in his memoirs a quarter of a century ago hawke did have a remarkable ability to absorb the essential features of an issue and to remember details for a long period something ross garnaut had pointed out long before garnaut said this was one of the satisfying things about briefing hawke if a briefing was interrupted by more urgent business it could be continued even a week or two later as if the interruption had not taken place there was no need to go over ground already covered because hawke remembered it walsh 1995 p118 hawke s exceptional personal discipline facilitated productive work with his staff the public service and people from the general community if something was given to him in writing he would read it in good time usually overnight if it was important enough he would want to argue about it at the next opportunity he would work for as long as was necessary to get the work done advertisement bob hawke would work for as long as was necessary to get the work done nic walker i stayed at the hawkes sandringham residence in melbourne over easter 1983 as we worked through the detail of what became the government s first budget statement in may 1983 that statement significantly reduced the huge projected deficit left by the fraser howard administration while making room for the introduction of new policies requiring public expenditure the only interruptions from early morning to midnight over the four days were for meetings with a succession of state premiers hawke as government leader but as prime minister he would only do the work that it was best for a prime minister to do he was fortunate to have the most talented australian cabinet but it was not only good fortune he made prominent places for the strongest supporters of his predecessor bill hayden as alp leader peter walsh john dawkins neal blewett and bill hayden himself and while his cabinet had incomparable talent he made better use of the talent he had than prime ministers before or since his relationship with his forceful treasurer was productive until it was consumed by leadership tension after the 1990 election hawke was very much the leader of his cabinet talking individually to each minister about priorities and directions within his or her portfolio but the directions being clear he would leave the minister to get on with the job monitoring progress without second guessing every move inevitably contentious issues would arise in the setting of directions or in implementing programs conflicting views would be put to the prime minister about the best way forward he would not let the differences fester but call the contesting parties together in his office to argue out the point in front of him while it could be uncomfortable for an economic adviser especially when the prime minister adjudicated in his favour against a minister it worked well for policy the breadth and depth of hawke s reform achievements would not have been possible without effective use of the capacities of the commonwealth public service he saw the public service as a rich resource of knowledge experience and analytic capacity he wanted to know the views of senior public servants on a current issue and especially if they were different than his own his chiefs of staff commencing with graham evans were all talented public servants his small private office advisory staff at the beginning a chief of staff one economic adviser one foreign affairs adviser two political advisers with links respectively into the nsw and victorian alp branches and senior communications staff were expected to interact closely and productively with the public service his interactions with his private staff and on occasions with the public service were shocking in their honesty hawke expected to be told clearly and forcefully if an adviser thought that a government position or prime ministerial idea was unsound economic reform advertisement australia s economic performance relative to other developed countries was mediocre and worse for the first eight decades of the 20th century as the relative decline continued through the slow prosperity of the postwar decades australian economists began to probe the policies of protection and state control of economic activity that had hindered productivity growth by the end of the 1970s there was some although by no means universal recognition in elite opinion that trade and financial liberalisation were necessary elements of a program of reform that was necessary to raise productivity growth popular opinion however was strongly wedded to the old australian ways and the beneficiaries of restrictions on competition invested heavily in the political process to reinforce popular resistance to change from 1974 large macroeconomic imbalances were superimposed on the poor productivity performance and interacted with it in damaging ways inflation started to rise from the late 1960s australia s terms of trade had risen exceptionally during and especially at the tail end of the postwar golden age of world development and this partially hid the emerging problem from view and then the conclusion of the catching up phase of japanese economic growth which had driven much of the increase in the terms of trade coincided with deep recession in the international economy after the first oil price shock in 1974 under the whitlam government fiscal expansion of appalling dimension sent domestic expenditure and wages to levels that would have been unsustainable even in the favourable times just as the good times were crumbling beneath australians feet john howard and bob hawke join the boy scouts at a jamboree in 1988 bryan charlton for a decade australia was mired in the combination of persistent high unemployment and high inflation low productivity growth compounded the macroeconomic problems through the decade of stagflation there was no opportunity for growing out of the macroeconomic imbalances under the fraser governments from 1975 to 1983 high inflation persisted and unemployment and budget and current account deficits rose to the highest levels in the postwar period unemployment lifted above 10 per cent as the hawke government took office hawke developed a program that required large changes in expectations and political culture expenditure growth would have to be greatly reduced to restore economic stability wages growth and for a while real wages would have to fall to restore full employment economic reform to increase productivity would moderate the reduction in living standards required for the restoration of full employment and economic stability productivity growth required difficult structural change all of the measures required to achieve these outcomes ran headlong into deeply held popular attitudes hawke s program secured wage restraint through the accord between the government and the australian council of trade unions actu to the unions expansion of employment was a priority increases in living standards were secured through provision of government services rather than job destroying wage increases medicare historic expansion of access to secondary and tertiary education and progressive adjustments to taxation and social security this had to be accommodated by sustained discipline in other expenditures and broadening of the taxation base tighter means tests on social security abandonment of a range of corporate welfare measures substantial reduction in the taxation privileges to superannuation and extending taxation to capital gains gold income wine revenue fringe benefits and a range of other previously exempt sources of income when opposition attacks on fiscal discipline threatened to bite in the 1984 election campaign the prime minister turned a point of vulnerability into an electoral virtue with the commitments to the budget trilogy despite serious setbacks in international conditions australia s terms of trade fell to historic lows in the mid 1980s there was considerable progress for seven years employment expanded proportionately more than ever before or since over a seven year period the budget moved into substantial surplus inflation fell but remained uncomfortably high advertisement hawke paul keating and gough whitlam at labor s 2007 campaign launch paul harris financial deregulation was implemented seamlessly through effective co operation between the prime minister and the treasurer through 1983 and 1984 the long term gains were large after a high economic and political price was paid when high interest rates in the late 1980s were followed by deep recession in 1990 and 1991 hawke saw the misjudgment of monetary policy in the new circumstances as the most damaging error of his government ending protection trade liberalisation was the central element in productivity raising reform and politically the most difficult on coming to office hawke had said that protection would be reduced when employment was growing steady progress was made year by year right through the hawke prime ministership but the biggest step was the last announced in recession in march 1991 across the board reforms announced that month completed the process through which australia and later new zealand the most protectionist of the developed countries in 1983 became the most open to international trade of the advanced economies the hawke government s reductions in protection began industry by industry in 1983 with the removal of quotas on steel imports and liberalisation of imports of whitegoods and heavy engineering products the fraser government s long term commitments to protection for the motor vehicle industry were curtailed in 1984 under the button car plan my report to the prime minister australia and the north east asian ascendency in october 1989 had recommended movement to free trade by 2000 by late 1990 the political ground had been thoroughly prepared i discussed the impact of high unemployment on trade liberalisation policy with the prime minister in december 1990 to delay the statement as some members of the government proposed would require the work to be done again and there was no certainty of when conditions might be favourable the decisive point in favour of proceeding was that the reductions in protection flowing from the statement would take effect from mid 1992 and would proceed gradually over the following four years it was reasonable to expect that by that time the economy would be growing again while it was politically difficult to make the announcement in the depths of recession the recovery from recession was economically and socially a favourable time for structural adjustment the prime minister decided to proceed in case the remarkable character of prime minister hawke s march 1991 statement on trade and industry policy is lost in the mist of time i will refer to the reflections of john hyde intellectual leader of the liberal party s historically important dries despite the recession then prevailing the government reaffirmed its intention to open up the australian economy hawke defended his decision with an impeccable statement of economic principle he most powerful spur to greater competitiveness is further tariff reduction tariffs have been one of the abiding features of the australian economy since federation the supposed virtues of this protection became deeply embedded in the psyche of the nation but what was the result inefficient industries that could not compete overseas and higher prices for consumers and higher costs for our efficient primary producers hyde 2002 p233 advertisement hyde sees this statement as the high point of rationality in australian economic policy hyde 2002 p234 what made hawke s reforms possible this story of the national interest in open trade prevailing over vested interests seems impossible now in 2019 what made it possible then that is a story of leadership with many parts it is a story of building on a base of transparent economic analysis of the effects of protection of long time perspectives on policy of discipline in the management of government and the public policy process of public education on the national interest and of gradual movement towards long term goals it is a story of leadership within a social democratic framework that gave a majority of ordinary australians confidence that they would not be stranded by change neither trade liberalisation nor productivity raising economic reform more generally was ever seen as being separate from employment income distribution and the provision of government services affecting equity hawke saw that good economic policy would make it possible over time for australians to enjoy higher standards of living although early restraint was necessary if long term goals were to be realised comprehensive trade liberalisation would follow and reinforce the re establishment of growth and community confidence in employment progress would require public education over time so that the community was never taken by surprise by sudden changes in direction here the whitlam across the board tariff cut of 1973 with its chaotic partial reversal through the introduction of import quotas in 1974 and through the fraser years was seen by hawke as the negative example to avoid stubbornly loyal hawke s speeches contained frequent references to the virtues of open trade from his early days as prime minister this reinforced the emerging understanding of costs of protection across parts of the community but there was no transformation of opinion in the electorate at large the opinion polls remained stubbornly loyal to the old protectionism however the public education allowed the community to put the trade liberalisation into context and reduced the intensity of reaction when it was later revealed as current policy the clear leadership from the head of government encouraged others in the community who favoured trade liberalisation to stronger voice and greater activity it was no longer respectable for businesses to openly seek higher protection in their own interests hawke s speeches in 1983 were directly important in causing the productivity commission then industries commission to strengthen its advocacy of far reaching liberalisation advertisement a new economic policy advisory council epac chaired by the prime minister brought together business union and community groups for discussion of productivity and income distribution issues it was served by a secretariat with considerable analytical capacity after the 1984 election at john dawkins suggestion the epac secretariat also became the secretariat of the cabinet committee on long term economic growth later the structural adjustment committee of cabinet an intellectual climate was developed in which to be credible in discussions with government or in public statements a business or business group would have to frame its arguments in terms of effects on the long term national interest a case needed evidence and rational analysis the special interest pleading that now is stock in trade for business groups was not attempted because it would be dismissed in ways that damaged its advocates business interests did not stop trying to influence government policy through all of the familiar mechanisms the heavily protected industries remained major donors to political parties but the clear lines of government policy constrained the drift into rent seeking behaviour trade union leaders representing protected industries retained their support for protection however through the auspices of the actu they were engaged in broader discussions of national policy and in the end were receptive to proposals for economically superior alternative means of raising the welfare of their members and of low income australians in the national interest the reforms of the hawke years demonstrate that a prime minister with strong electoral standing has considerable autonomy in implementing reform in the national interest it also shows that consistent messages to the community over long periods and commitment to gradual and steady progress towards long term goals can help an electorally strong prime minister to implement politically difficult decisions in the national interest on many of the hawke era reforms bipartisan support came only after the new policies were operating with public support on two big ones financial liberalisation in 1983 and 1984 and the last and biggest step in dismantling protection in 1991 bipartisan support from howard as treasury spokesman in 1983 4 and hewson as opposition leader in 1991 was present at the time decisions were announced recession and its aftermath the recession of 1990 91 inflicted great damage on the australian economy and community it weakened the government and its authority on reform it did not lead to the hawke government backtracking on policies which had been announced or were in train by the time of the change in leadership in december 1991 the economy was growing again this turned out to be the start of the first decade since federation in which australian productivity growth was at the top of the oecd after 90 years in the bottom half or worse it was the beginning of the longest uninterrupted expansion in the history of australia or any other developed country now 28 years old it was the beginnings of a long period of low inflation advertisement hawke international relations and race hawke and curtin were deeply grounded both in australian national tradition and sentiment and in an international view of the nature and destiny of australians curtin was not immune to political appeals to white australia but used them more reluctantly than any other labor figure from federation to the pacific war hawke was the prime minister who contested and subdued the backlash to large scale non discriminatory immigration and so made racial diversity a feature of our modern democracy gough whitlam with hawke then a trade union leader bill snedden and then new guinea chief minister sir michael somare head to the funeral of new zealand s prime minister norman kirk antony matheus linsen in giving this credit to hawke i acknowledge the earlier contributions of harold holt and then in larger measure gough whitlam and malcolm fraser to ending the white australia policy but it was in the middle and later 1980s that the changes were transformative for australian society and generated strong reactions that were combatted with strong leadership the consolidation of non discriminatory immigration policy supported the leading role that australia took in regional affairs including and beyond asia pacific economic cooperation hawke and our democratic future bob hawke was a highly educated and intelligent citizen of the world at the same time he shared the values interests enthusiasms and weaknesses of his fellow citizens he was deeply rooted in labor values and culture but was australian first of all i spent an afternoon with bob soon after malcolm turnbull became prime minister i think he s the best equipped prime minister since you bob i said he s got nearly as hard a job as you had and there s a chance he ll manage it i think you re right bob responded i ll keep working my butt off to get my mob up but if he handles it right malcolm will be there for a decade as the months and years passed he expressed deeper disappointment at australian as well as international leadership he didn t see a problem with our democracy good leadership could still put us on a better path advertisement hard to believe how bad it

home sabah yong belt road best way forward for malaysia asean yong may 17th 2019 11 30 am 1747 views kota kinabalu malaysia and other asean countries have taken the correct strategic position to be engaged in the belt road initiative advisor of the malaysia maritime silk road research society and sabah maritime silk road research society datuk yong teck lee pointed out that it is beyond any doubt that the ongoing trade war between america and china is having an unprecedented major negative impact on the global economy economists and analysts are unanimous in their assessments that the trade war started by the us is hurting economies and ordinary people including that of the us the crude way that the us under the trump administration tore apart international agreements has shown to the rest of the world that american leadership is no longer reliable he said in a statement yesterday yong a former chief minister recalled that several asian and pacific countries including malaysia were pressured by america to overcome domestic reservations to accept the us led trans pacific partnership agreement tppa in 2016 tppa was a trade pact signed in 2016 between australia brunei canada chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore vietnam and the united states after a new us president took office in 2017 yong said the us unilaterally left the tppa which it must be remembered was initiated and led by the us in the first place this unpredictability of the us in world leadership was mentioned by the prime minister malaysia as a reason for not relying too much on american leadership it is therefore timely that the one belt one road policy initiative by china in 2013 at kazakhstan and jakarta has begun to bear fruits for the economies along the belt road regions there is no other multi national economic plan in sight that can stimulate the economies of so many countries he said according to yong the formation of the aiib asian infrastructure investment bank a multilateral development bank under the belt road initiative is a practical and welcome mechanism to allow asian countries to invest in their own infrastructure and productive economy the aiib consists of 97 countries including most asian countries canada uk germany saudi arabia australia russia with a portfolio of close to usd 100 trillion in spite of the relentless onslaught of western media campaign against the belt road concept he said a closer look at the belt road initiative by the countries concerned have convinced these countries to stay with the belt road policy led by china the philippines for example even though it is a close ally of america secured trade and investment deals worth usd12 6 billion when the philippines president rodrigo duterte was in beijing for the second belt road forum last month initiated by the chinese president xi ji ping in spite of the prevalence of the american news in the philippines duterte has gained substantially in the philippines mid term elections this week malaysia too managed to overcome her earlier concerns that the good china malaysia relations might be affected by the issue of the east coast railway link ecrl and other china investments in malaysia by the time of the second belt road forum attended also by prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad the ecrl issue was settled successfully in a win win manner it was reassuring to both malaysians and china that the prime minister had declared malaysia aji s full support for the belt road initiative said yong he added the success of the belt road summit in beijing last month was the only global event that has injected energy into the economic growth of asia including south east asia malaysia which has seen its biggest fall in the stock market below the benchmark of 1 600 points and faced with ringgit depreciating has taken the right path to forge closer economic ties with china there is no issue of debt trap in malaysia aji s economic ties to china for instance even at its earlier cost of rm65 5 billion the cost of the ecrl is only 7 acu of the total national external debt this means that 93 acu of the current national debt of rm924 9 billion has nothing to do with china or the belt road initiative indeed bank negara figures show that 55 5 acu of malaysia aji s national debt is denominated in us dollars 31 2 acu in ringgit 2 2 acu in japanese yen excluding the rm7 3 billion in samurai bonds taken by malaysia in march this year and 11 3 acu others he explained yong added this post election support of the belt road initiative by the malaysian government echoes the example of sri lanka which had a similar change of government in 2015 the winning party had also pledged to review china investment particularly on the hambantota international port in some ways sri lanka aji s hambantota port was like malaysia aji s ecrl ajy both were election issues and both were retained on a win win basis with china by the newly elected government according to western media sri lanka was not able to pay the china loan taken for the construction of the port and that china had seized the port with the motive to turn it into a naval base in fact the newly elected sri lanka government not only found no improper elements in the construction and the financing package but that the port has been able to repay its loans from its container terminal business it was reported that the loan for the port amounted to only 1 5 acu of sri lanka aji s external debt ownership never changed hands from sri lanka to china the oft repeated criticism of belt road policy is that it is a debt trap disguised as a loan to ensnare poor countries the allegation is that china gives loans to poor countries to build infrastructure assets such as ports and railways when these countries cannot pay back the loan china will seize the assets this false narrative has been repeated so many times that some people have begun to fall for it what are infrastructure loans the worry is that government loans are a burden on future generations however infrastructure expenditure is capital expenditure it is an investment on infrastructure that will create new wealth for more people by increasing the productive capacity and gdp of the nation the development of infrastructure such as highways railways sea ports air ports telecommunications energy generation water supply contribute towards the upliftment of the economy it is apparent to all that wherever a highway was built the areas on both sides of the highway became regions of economic activities shops houses recreation centres are built jobs are created poverty reduced with accessibility education health care and social services became more readily available to the rural population basically quality of life improved this is what the belt road initiative is all about instead of seeing the noble side to this innovative belt road initiative the us vice president chose to call the belt road as ajm constricting belt one way road ajq at last november aji s apec asia pacific economic conference at papua new guinea it did not occur to the visiting us vice president that at that apec conference the china president opened a china funded new road and new school both of which open up a bright future for more people of the poor nation this is in contrast to the us president who went to vietnam to meet north korean leader in february who tried to sell arms to vietnam trump has notoriously said to his vietnam host ajm i appreciate the fact that you aji re looking at our military equipment we make the best military equipment in the world by far whether it aji s jet fighters or missiles or rockets or anything you want ajq said trump source courtesy of the borneo post

monrovia the governor of the central bank of liberia mr nathaniel patray failed to utilize his authority and functional independence regarding the exercise surrounding the disbursement of the controversial us 25 million according to findings contained in the agreed upon procedures report of the general auditing commission released thursday report by rodney d sieh auditor yusador gaye in her cover letter of the report submitted to attorney general frank musah dean noted the meetings minutes of temt the economic management team showed that temt mandated cbl to carry out the mop up exercise and also authorized the cbl to re infuse the mopped up funds into the economy more importantly section 1 1 9 part ii count 4 of the findings cites the cbl act as requiring that the cbl to have functional independence power and authority to conduct foreign exchange operations governor patray according to the findings indicated to the gac through a documented review questionnaire that the mop up exercise was authorized by the economic management team however the chairman of temt finance and economic planning minister samuel d tweah indicated to the gac that the temt did not issue the cbl a written instruction for the mop up exercise rather the mop up strategy was authorized by temt minister tweah indicated in his documented interview questionnaire that temt authorized the cbl to re infuse the mopped up liberian dollars into the market through the commercial banks the temt and the cbl did not provide evidence of the authorization to re infuse the mopped up liberian dollars into the economy as per the mou us 25m repaid to gol coffers the report appears to remove much of the blame from minister tweah who has been on the receiving end of criticisms over his handling of the saga the minister has maintained that the temt is only a policy making or strategy approving body the gac audit confirms tweah s statement that the temt approved the mopped up strategy while squaring off with the kroll report which stated that the cbl banking division implemented the money operations a source at the gac speaking to frontpageafrica on condition of anonymity thursday said the report was based on evidence it is a report of factual finding section 1 4 2 of the report however points out that there was no corresponding usd account opened to hold the 25m usd to be drawn from the international foreign exchange reserve account for the purpose of the mopped up exercise governor patray per his documented interview indicated that after temt s authorization the re infusion of the mopped up liberian dollars started in november 2018 due to complaints from commercial banks and customers during the christmas seasons in its findings made public thursday the gac concluded that it was able to verify that the government of liberia had paid back into the foreign reserve the us 25m borrowed for the mopped up exercise said the report the gac was informed by the cbl through a formal communication dated april 2 2019 with reference no cbl e gov nrp 2242 2019 that the government of liberia has not refunded the amount used for the mopped up exercise although the mou stated that gol should refund the amount on or before december 31 2018 the cbl on october 30 2018 recorded in its books an account receivable of us 25 million from the government of liberia us 15m in direct mop up 2m for total in march deputy governor charles e sirleaf former governor milton a weeks dorbor m hagba head of the cbl s banking division richard h walker and joseph f dennis where held criminally liable for l 2 645 000 000 brought into the country which could not be accounted for by the defendants the banking division supervises money transactions and operations economists say discrepancies between summary and detail report could be more errors but point to quality and capacity issues at the bank the gac said it did not note any transaction with narrative on the international foreign exchange reserve account held with the federal bank of new york relating to the us 25million mop up exercise however a letter dated april 22 2019 from executive governor nathaniel r patray iii revealed that the cbl operational fund was used for the us 25million mop up exercise the funds used for the mop up us 15m for direct mop up and 2m auction to total liberia inc were traced to the cbl operational vault account however the findings noted several discrepancies regarding how the funds were disbursed with some vendors listed as receiving some of the mop up money either not registered legally or simply did not receive the cash according to the gac s findings a total of fifteen entities were listed by the cbl but those entities indicated that they did not participate in the mop up exercise the report does raise some eyebrows about the scope of the gac and the ag s functions most ag s forensic experts say do not do agreed upon procedures except when an outsider like usaid pay for them to do a work and both agreed on the procedures to be followed as was the case of kroll in the case of the gac s current debacle it appears the ag is under the direction of the government which is an agreed

business registry records amounting to us 702 680 00 another fifty two entities participated in the mop up exercise per cbl records but did not answer or reply to telephone calls and text messages that amounts to 1 092 292 00 eight entities also participated per cbl records in the mop up exercise but were not in operation when during the field visit according to the gac the banking department of the cbl disbursed the united states dollars in the ratios of 51 8 to fx bureaus and the remaining 48 2 to major importers and small businesses contrary to the approved recommendation the auditors confirm the names entities telephone numbers locations and amount transacted with the beneficiaries to determine the legitimacy and accuracy of the transactions a variance of lr 17k uncovered the gac documented that it requested documents related to the beneficiaries of the us 25million mopup exercise from the cbl the ministry of commerce and industry and the liberia business registry to determine the legitimacy of the beneficiaries the gac also confirmed prior to the field visit the name location and contact of each beneficiary as per the list submitted to us by the cbl 2 2 3 for the period july 17 to october 26 2018 cbl recorded us 15 million as the amount sold to 281 businesses and foreign exchange bureaus by direct mop up while us 2 000 000 00 was recorded as the amount sold to total liberia inc through a special auction the report further documented that there was a variance of lr 17 775 323 78 between the liberian dollar portion of the summary report and detailed report submitted by the cbl section 3 1 2 of the report states there was also a variance of lr 108 928 788 37 between the amounts in the summary liberian dollar report per beneficiary presented by the cbl and the amount confirmed by the beneficiaries in another discrepancy the gac said the cbl special liberian dollars mop up escrow account showed that the amount of lr 2 303 363 898 00 was transferred to the operational vault of the cbl whereas the cbl press statement dated march 5 2019 indicated that lr 1 300 000 000 00 was transferred from liberia dollars special escrow account to the operational vault for re infusion into the economy the cbl issued a memo for the opening of a special mop up exercise escrow account on july 19 2018 three days after the commencement of the exercise but an examination of the bank statement of the special liberian dollars escrow account showed that the initial deposit into the account occurred on august 17 2018 a month after the commencement of the exercise president george manneh weah on monday july 16 2018 through an address to the nation announced the immediate infusion of us 25 million by the cbl into the economy to mop up excess liquidity of liberian dollars the cbl then signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of liberia to use a portion of the international foreign exchange reserve in the amount of us 25 million to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mitigate the volatility in the exchange the mou stated that the government should refund the amount mentioned on or before december 31 2019 governor nathaniel patray indicated to the gac through a documented review questionnaire that the mop up exercise was authorized by the economic management team but the chairman of temt finance and economic planning minister samuel d tweah indicated to the gac that the temt did not issue the cbl a written instruction for the mop up exercise rather the mop up strategy was authorized by temt minister tweah indicated in his documented interview questionnaire that temt authorized the cbl to re infuse the mopped up liberian dollars into the market through the commercial banks the temt and the cbl did not provide evidence of the authorization to re infuse the mopped up liberian dollars into the economy as per the mou excerpts from the agreed upon procedures report of the general auditing commission agreed upon procedure vs forensic late thursday attorney general dean confirmed to frontpageafrica that his office has received the completed auditor general s report of factual findings in the application on the agreed upon procedures of the us 25million mop up exercise conducted by the central bank of liberia cbl as mandated by the technical economic management team temt auditor general gaye in her communication to the attorney general thursday made note of an engagement letter of march 22 2019 in which it was agreed that the gac would perform an agreed upon procedures aup in relation to the us 25 million mop up exercise two reports the usaid commissioned kroll and the presidential investigation technical team pitt recommended forensic audits kroll recommended kroll was unable to reconcile the total value of disbursements for the period january 2016 to december 2018 with the total value of legacy and new banknotes disbursed for the corresponding period kroll recommends that a full forensic audit of disbursements from the cbl for the period january 2016 to december 2018 is undertaken which should include an exercise to verify that disbursements from the cbl have actually been received in full by the stated recipients using a risk based approach the report does raise some eyebrows about the scope of the gac and the ag s functions most ag s forensic experts say do not do agreed upon procedures except when an outsider like usaid pay for them to do a work and both agreed on the procedures to be followed as was the case of kroll in the case of the gac s current debacle it appears the ag is under the direction of the government which is an agreed upon procedure agreed upon procedures mean you only do the procedures are you are told to do kroll was agreed upon procedure because usaid paid kroll and told kroll what to do one expert noted no assurances provided gac says in her communication to the attorney general thursday ag gaye said the integrity body had completed the execution of the agreed upon procedures engagement covering the period july 17 2018 to march 21 2019 please note that records and documents to which the agreed procedures were applied are the responsibility of the central bank of liberia and the technical economic management team our responsibility is to apply the agreed procedures and report the factual findings we conducted this engagement in accordance with international standard on related services isrs 4400 please also note that the cbl provided responses to the draft report of factual findings which were evaluated and considered where necessary because this engagement is not an audit or a review of financial statements we did not provide any assurance be it reasonable or limited with the latest findings from the gac political observers are keen to see who will take the fall from a scandal that has dogged the weah presidency since last year growing out of the presidential investigative team s report which calls for a forensic investigation of the entire mop up exercise carried out by the central bank of liberia and the report by kroll and commissioned by the united states aid for international development usaid president weah in march mandated the gac to conduct an investigative audit into how the u s 25 million earmarked for the mopping exercise was expended last july president weah announced an immediate infusion by the central bank of twenty five million united states dollars into the economy to mop up the excess liquidity of liberian dollars and mandated the cbl to provide more effective supervision and regulation of money changers or foreign exchange bureau source exit looms for cbl s patray it can be recalled that in july 2018 the government approved the infusion of u s 25 million into the liberian economy in order to bring about stability on the market the cbl said the mop up exercise was necessary to stabilize the liberian dollar against the us dollar finance minister tweah had publicly disclosed that he had opted to use money exchangers and other businesses rather than the commercial banks because according to him use of the commercial banks would not have yielded the desired results the minister has repeatedly defended his actions claiming that he did not do anything illegal pressured by a bring back our money protest and concerns over how the money was distributed the president set up a presidential task force and also solicited the help of the united states government to get to the bottom of the saga in its findings the kroll report noted discrepancies in the manner in which the government carried out the us 25 mopping up exercise on the money market kroll was not provided with documentation setting out how the usd mopup exercise was structured or implemented or which organizations were targeted by the cbl the report said kroll added the approach taken by the cbl to implement the usd mop up exercise whereby small teams of bank personnel directly purchased lrd banknotes from local businesses and foreign exchange bureaus in exchange for usd notes created an enhanced level of risk separately the special presidential task force recommended that given the many discrepancies noted in the manner in which the mop up exercise was conducted in relation to the infusion of the us 25 million into the liberian economy and the scope time and financial resource limitations encountered by the pit tc the temt and the central bank of liberia put a halt to the exercise and that a forensic investigation of the entire mop up exercise be conducted without any delay added pitt given the many discrepancies observed throughout the investigation in relation to the operations of the central bank of liberia in executing its statutory mandate there is a need to review the standard operational procedures sop banking supervision and internal controls of the central bank of liberia to curb the possibility of abuse of the money supply of the nation as well as enhancing efficiency and productivity 3 7 to further protect currency banknotes in reserve the central bank of liberia should consider discontinuing the use of the vault at the erstwhile national housing and saving bank after two major reports the one from the usaid commissioned kroll and the presidential team the dust emanating from the controversy over the us 25 million mop up exercise leaves more questions than answers with the latest findings from the gac political observers are keen to see who will take the fall from a scandal that has dogged the weah presidency since last year as this report went to press one senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity out of respect of the president s mandate last week banning officials from making public comment on policy issues hinted that the presidential ax could wield its way in one direction to the extent there are questions and discrepancies raised by the report the relevant persons at the cbl would have to answer thus signaling that governor patray could soon be shown the exit door
false uhuru in the week of the 14th of january 2019 zimbabwe burst into flames as the general citizenry in urban areas protested at rising poverty and inequality interestingly for zimbabwe high hopes had been sold to the citizenry and international community after the deposing of longtime ruler robert mugabe in november 2017 emmerson mnangagwa the new president promised a new era and came up with the open for business mantra pursuant to this the rhetoric of government shifted and during the july 2018 elections the opposition was allowed to campaign freely and made inroads into some of the rural strongholds the elections were never near any perfect and when the zimbabwe electoral commission zec delayed in releasing the presidential election results this led to protests in the streets of harare on the 1st of august 2018 in response the state unleashed the security services on the protesters leading to the death of six people and more than a dozen being treated for gunshot related injuries this became the first signal of the foretaste of what was to come as threatened by presidential spokesperson george charamba in reference to the terror unleashed on citizens in response to the january 2019 protests when the nurses and junior doctors went on strike in december 2018 the government responded with heavy handedness and arm twisting tactics the ruling party has been in denial that at the heart of all these problems and rising discontent are escalating levels of poverty and inequality exacerbated by the worsening macro economic condition the government has sought to pursue a path of strict economism that seems to be inspired by the late chilean dictator augusto pinochet the austerity for prosperity mantra championed by the government has become austerity for calamity for the general citizenry the poor in the emergency room in 2015 dr alex magaisa in one of his big saturday read instalments raised concern around rising urban poverty within the townships popularly known as the ghettos he wrote on how the urban underclass had been ravaged by the hostile macro economic conditions they were surviving on less than a dollar and could not afford basic essentials in the shops the populace residing in the ghetto had to rely on the informal economy where they buy basic essentials in repackaged smaller units called katsaona literally meaning a small accident in shona however katsaona in ghetto lingo simply means an emergency relief and for the urban poor life had become desperate in 2014 the reserve bank of zimbabwe introduced bond coins to deal with the problem of liquidity in terms cash shortage especially as ordinary citizens were being short changed by local businesses to buy unwanted items later on in 2016 bond notes were added to the coins hereafter known as the zimbabwe bond bollar zwb and the reserve bank of zimbabwe declared that they were at par with the united states dollar us and backed by an afrexim bank facility in 2017 banks started to experience cash shortages firstly it was the us and followed by the local bond currency thereafter the zwb started to be cross rated with the united states dollar and actually depreciated to its nadir by 400 0n the 10th of october 2018 t0 trade at one zim bollar to twenty cents united states dollar zwb 1 us 0 20 the government made some legislative interventions that outlawed and criminalized the trade of the zwb on the parallel market and this threatened many local corporates according to zim bollar index from november 2018 the value of the zwb on the parallel market stabilized to an average of us 1 zwb 3 30 on the parallel market the country started to experience a severe foreign currency shortage on the official market as corporates could not go to the parallel market in response business started to demand payment in foreign currency or alternatively started to have different pricing tiers the structure was such that for those paying in foreign currency goods and services became cheaper but for those using the zwb things became expensive in all these shifts prices of basic commodities and services were constantly rising and did not drop the country experienced shortages of medical drugs basic commodities and fuel leading to the emergence of queues again in zimbabwe reminiscent of 2007 2008 a rudderless ship government disowns its own money the government of zimbabwe goz in late 2018 through treasury announced a 2 tax on all virtual transactions which were later revised to transactions between zwb 10 20 000 essentially this increased the cost of doing business and the cost was passed on to consumers in the 2018 19 budget announced in november 2018 the goz demanded duty tax for cars and other goods to be paid for in foreign currency taking into account several utterances of the minister of finance mthuli ncube in domestic and international fora stating that the zwb was not at par to the us this generated further uncertainty within the economy therefore by insisting on the policy of the zim bollar being equal to the american dollar yet at the same time demanding some of the statutory obligations to be paid in hard currency it meant government was somehow disowning its currency these policy contradictions from the government created distortions within the economy thereby rendering it ungovernable this led to rising prices of basic commodities as well as inflation figures thus adversely impacting on consumers as all this mayhem ensued within the economy salaries of civil servants the majority ordinary workers in the private sector and payments by the general populace in the informal economy were transacted in zwb and virtual payments resultantly the country faced a number of labour upheavals as workers found their earnings and savings eroded by inflation it seemed zimbabwe was returning to 2007 8 when citizens lost pensions and savings due to hyperinflation in all these economic challenges government pursued a denialist syndrome never saw its policies as culpable but blamed business and some faceless saboteurs in a way the government went back to the mugabe default settings at the heart of zimbabwe s unending political and economic challenges is the need for fundamental structural reforms will zanu pf reform itself out of power the events leading to the ultimate fall of mugabe in november 2017 gave zimbabweans a glimmer of hope for a new beginning it became almost a rallying point that zimbabweans had to give ed emmerson mnangagwa a chance but sooner than no later it began to emerge that zanu pf was not interested in serious political and economic reforms before the november 2017 coup zanu pf had been consistent and asserted on record that they will not reform themselves out of power president emmerson mnangagwa shifted from the radical rhetoric of his predecessor robert mugabe but beyond that failed to bring in new policy changes that would enable the government to walk its talk therefore the open for business mantra lacked substantive policy and administrative actions to make it a reality and turn the fortunes of the economy allegations of patronage and corruption that had characterised president mugabe s rule began to resurface former presidential special adviser christopher mutsvangwa raised the lid on the existence of a cabal in the fuel sector and how they are milking the treasury riding on the distorted exchange rate system later on acie lumumba of viva zimbabwe after his short lived appointment as the chairperson of the ministry of finance communications taskforce gave credence to the existence of the fuel cabal and its deep connections at the reserve bank prior to this the mnangagwa administration had seen the domestic debt ballooning from 3 6bn to 7 6bn in 8 months allegedly to fund the elections via command agriculture and the presidential input support scheme at the core of this economic indiscipline and lack of appetite for reform is a parasitic network of a black business class with strong party military links dr jabusile shumba s book zimbabwe s predatory state party military and business gives illuminating insights into how this politico military elite class uses state power patronage and violence for accumulation purposes across all sectors of the economy the group derives its power to influence policy via the joint operations command joc a body that has been allegedly confirmed by exiled former zanu pf politiburo member and information czar professor jonathan moyo in one of his tweets the activities of joc are well documented in the media regarding various policy positions and actions on the economy these have sometimes extended to local government level especially with regards to the continuous removal of vendors from the streets and demolishing of informal business structures by the military when its power is threatened this political military elite does not hesitate to flex its muscle and when it does so as on the 1st of august 2018 and now 14th 21st of january 2019 the constitution and citizen s rights have always been suspended therefore any economic or political reforms in zimbabwe that do not address or seek to assuage the interests of this securocrats business class will most likely yield nothing which way the benevolent dictator or the democratic developmental state emmerson mnangagwa s government has sought to pursue the benevolent dictator model in the mould of rwanda s paul kagame singapore s lee kuan yew and china s deng xiaoping in these countries the value system and meritocratic bureaucratic framework were complementary and deterred overt large scale and inefficient corruption furthermore they were underpinned by the idea of a capable and efficient developmental state that is able to kick start or accelerate economic development hence the need for principled authoritarian leadership in mnangagwa s thinking a focus on strict economism will deliver growth and thus make human rights inconsequential unbeknown to the mnangagwa administration is how history technology and opportunity have not been on their side and ever shifting since deng assumed power in the late 70s in china paul kagame in the mid 90s in rwanda and lee kuan yew in the late 50s history presented these three leaders with a great opportunity as they came to power with almost unquestioned hegemony and the necessary moral legitimacy to pursue economic reforms all the three countries sought a clear break with their past and took a hard stance on corruption for instance lee kuan yew jailed his benefactor during the elections campaign when he became corrupt and in china a number of high ranking chinese communist party cpc have been sentenced to death over corruption convictions in mnangagwa s second republic much emphasis has been put on economic commandism an economic model that emphasises ordering or forcing people to do something rather than freewill in a largely deeply polarised society and at the same failed to undertake the necessary key governance reforms and instituting meritocratic bureaucratic frameworks ever since the emergence of the opposition movement for democratic change mdc in the late 90s zimbabwe has been largely socially divided along urban versus rural though with strong interlinkages zanu pf largely relied on coercion to remain in power but the geography of its influence has been mostly confided to the rural and farming areas on the other hand the mdc despite state supported repression has managed to dominate within the urban areas and pockets of relatively developed rural business and mining centers outside the thesis of violence zimbabwe has remained an electorally divided nation and a close reading of electoral data from 2000 to present show that the two major parties zanu pf and mdc have been neck and neck in terms of numbers no party has managed to effect total hegemony on the zimbabwean polity producing the urban versus rural dynamic despite that there are strong interlinkages on a general note the urbanites have mainly driven commerce and industry while the ruralites drive agricultural production yet the lines are blurred some of the securocrats or ruling party affiliated urbanites have been steering agricultural production with rural proxies the rural urban divide has not been a clear cut neat aspect therefore for any economic reform and growth to take place there is need to marshal together the productive forces of these two groups towards a common national development vision having a common national development vision means having a political and economic governance model that seeks to shift from exclusive command economics and possibly inclusive democratic developmental economics engaging the opposition civil society and business becomes a sine qua non for any progressive step forward there is need to shift governance mode from domination to devolved power the 2013 constitution sets up a basis for this new approach however it seems the mnangagwa administration ever since its assumption of power has sought an exclusive economic growth model that do not take a significant section of its citizens on board the relentless pursuit for open for business at the expense of poor citizens will most likely breed more instability there is a mistaken assumption that economic reforms can be fostered on the people via the barrel of the gun also to seek an inclusive governance model would mean talking to the opposition a position not favoured by the politico military business class despite the conditions and circumstances demanding the government to be inclusive this is the dilemma that the mnangagwa administration faces the era of strongman politics in africa seems to be increasingly facing challenges as the case with bobi wine in uganda and dianne rwigara in rwanda this is why the current path of command economism may not be sustainable and thus deceptive it s time for the government to pursue seriously its recent found calls for dialogue tamuka chirimambowa is a development studies phd candidate at

david rowe s cartoon for friday 17th may 2019 david rowe aussie dollar hits 3 year low the economy may also be at an inflection point as evidenced by the australian dollar falling to a three year low this issue of wage growth is a really big issue says geoff weir economic growth is slowing house prices are still falling consumers are spending less on discretionary items wage growth is subdued and unemployment is edging up the real economy is pretty soft and i m getting a bit bearish says geoff weir a director at financial sector services who has consulted to the reserve bank of australia and treasury advertisement i don t think we re about to go into recession but i think we are heading for sluggish growth and potentially rising unemployment either party is going to find it difficult the rba has become less confident about the economy and will almost certainly cut interest rates within the next couple of months the central bank last week was forced to downgrade its outlook for the economy following weak inflation data softening consumer spending and a likely sharper downturn in housing construction on thursday official employment figures showed a mixed picture advertisement unemployment edged up to 5 2 per cent but total employment rose by 28 400 in april the rise in the jobless rate was due to more people looking for work which pushed up the participation rate to a record high 65 8 per cent yet leading indicators for the labour market including hiring intentions by employers measured by the nab business survey suggest employment growth will soon slow that means the long overdue stronger wage growth the rba and morrison government have been waiting for is unlikely to materialise in the near term scott morrison and bill shorten have both campaigned on being the best placed leader to handle the economic situation bill shorten or scott morrison will face challenges after the election dominic lorrimer morrison warns that economic headwinds mean now is not the time to risk a higher taxing higher spending labor government advertisement no talk of difficult reforms shorten argues only labor can generate better wage growth through direct government interventions such as lifting the minimum wage to a living wage paying subsidies for childcare workers restoring weekend penalty rates in some sectors and the potential return of industry wide bargaining for low wage occupations neither leader speaks much about the difficult economic reforms required to lift wages sustainably by achieving higher business productivity shadow treasurer chris bowen is anxious about inheriting a softening economy whoever is treasurer after saturday will be forced to again downgrade the federal budget s wage growth forecasts following the rba s recent move advertisement this issue of wage growth is a really big issue says weir it doesn t just feed into consumption but it also has a major impact on budgets the april budget forecast wage growth to rebound to 3 25 per cent in 2020 21 and 3 5 per cent in 2021 22 well above the current annual rate of 2 3 per cent if as expected the rba cuts rates from the already record low 1 5 per cent in the next couple of months the bank will move closer to running out of monetary policy ammunition near zero interest rates if rates drop to 1 per cent or below policymakers will confront the possibility of approaching near zero interest rates in that scenario the rba would like to see fiscal policy such as income tax cuts and infrastructure spending play a larger role in supporting the economy advertisement yet that would require either josh frydenberg or bowen to renege on their political priority of budget surpluses frydenberg has pledged a consistent return to surplus from 2019 20 onwards bowen has pledged bigger budget buffers to negate voter perceptions that labor is not as good at managing the budget yet those mildly contractionary fiscal policies notwithstanding some income tax cuts due through rebates to low income earners after they file their tax returns from july are at odds with an easing monetary policy i told you so the glass half empty economic outlook means some close observers think that if the coalition loses it might not be such a bad result in the long term advertisement if morrison is able to keep a loss to a respectable margin and the economy does weaken over the next term of government labor would be under pressure morrison or whoever is the liberal party leader post the election could turn around and say i told you so about the risks of labor managing the economy whether or not labor s proposed changes to industrial relations negative gearing capital gains tax breaks and franking credit cash refunds cause a negative impact any weakening of the economy on labor s watch would be easy fodder for the coalition separately challenging international headwinds await the next government australia s two most important economic partners china and the united states are again at loggerheads over trade and technology advertisement us president donald trump last week ratcheted up his trade war lifting tariffs to 25 per cent on us200 billion 290 billion of imports from china he is also threatening to hit the remaining us300 billion of goods imported from china with tariffs waiting out trump jpmorgan chief economist and head of global economic research bruce kasman told afr weekend on a visit to sydney this week the chance of a us china deal was not that much higher than 50 per cent i think the chinese are going to be put into a more difficult position to make compromises and secondly as the clock gets closer to 2020 there is more chance of the chinese waiting out the trump administration to see who comes next in the medium term a slower china would act as a drag on the world economy and hurt australia david rowe if a compromise isn t reached china s economy will likely slow down and that could be bad news for australian exports advertisement short term there could be benefits by china buying fewer american products and more australian exports such as agriculture and natural gas a china economic slowdown could also prompt the government to accelerate its infrastructure stimulus boosting demand for iron ore yet in the medium term a slower china would act as a drag on the world economy and hurt australia trump and president xi jinping are likely to come face to face at the group of 20 leaders meeting in japan in late june china is still bitter morrison or shorten will also be attending and will need to emphasise the importance of a de escalation in us china tensions advertisement if shorten makes the trip it will be one of his first big tests in foreign affairs china is still bitter about the coalition s hardening stance against china over the past 18 months public censoring of china for interference in the domestic political system banning chinese telecommunications giants from the 5g wireless network and calling out beijing for cyber hacking and intellectual property theft have strained the bilateral relationship richard mcgregor lowy institute senior fellow and china expert says australia s relationship with china is not back in the deep freezer but is being kept at a low temperature both sides whoever wins should expect to be tested by china after the election mcgregor says china would like to revisit the huawei decision but australia is unlikely to do that if labor wins china will be hoping for a reset in relations meanwhile closer to home papua new guinea is on the

china s central bank will use foreign exchange intervention and monetary policy tools to stop the yuan weakening past the key 7 per dollar level in the near term three people familiar with the central bank s thinking said at present rest assured they will certainly not let it break 7 a source told reuters a defence of the 7 level could help boost confidence in the currency and soothe investor fears about a sharp depreciation in the yuan or renminbi even as souring trade relations with washington make competitive devaluation a compelling option for beijing breaking 7 is beneficial to china because it can reduce some of the effects of tariff increases but the impact on our renminbi confidence is negative and funds will flow out the source said the yuan fell to its weakest level since december on friday and to within striking distance of the 7 mark last seen during the 2008 financial crisis it has weakened 3 per cent in the past month on fading hopes of a deal being struck in the long running trade war between beijing and washington the latest flare up in those tensions saw us president donald trump increase tariffs on chinese imports provoking a similar tariff rise from china although a weaker yuan would support chinese exporters the decline would need to be significant to offset the impact of higher us tariffs such a fall could in turn fuel capital flight and undermine china s economic stability policy insiders said the source told reuters that china s issue of central bank bills in hong kong this week was a clear indication the people s bank of china s wanted to soak up offshore yuan to discourage investors from short selling it the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment on friday a second source familiar with the pboc s thinking said the monetary authority might tolerate the yuan weakening to 7 on fundamental factors but would act to prevent speculative short selling of the currency stability vs competitiveness a stable currency is imperative for china as it seeks to balance its investment driven economy attract more portfolio inflows and push for global equity and bond index inclusions the tightly managed currency fell heavily in 2018 and before that in 2015 when the pboc devalued the currency the stakes are much higher now said bryan carter head of emerging market fixed income at bnp paribas asset management in london a rapid devaluation would shake confidence in the local market and among domestic investors proving counterproductive carter said before reuters reported source comments on pboc china s balancing act goes beyond maintaining domestic confidence as the country s current account is seen swinging from a decades long surplus toward a deficit the yuan s exchange rate is expected to become more volatile a majority of more than 12 money managers traders and economists reuters spoke over the past week expected pboc to defend the renminbi while china primarily used direct dollar selling intervention in 2015 it switched to more unconventional methods such as tightening yuan funding costs and using swaps as the currency fell in 2018 the pboc reintroduced a counter cyclical factor a secret component it uses in adjusting the daily reference point for the yuan s trading band in august last year market participants say it has been using that factor to temper depreciation expectations in the past week by setting a firmer benchmark for yuan than implied by the moves of global currencies i don t believe we will rely on yuan depreciation to boost exports the yuan is not only for facilitating foreign trade but it could also affect capital flows one of the sources said barring any sharp rise in the dollar the possibility for a near term dip in the yuan below 7 is relatively small going against this thinking is market positioning which points to further weakness in the offshore markets the currency s value one year out had weakened to 6 9770 per dollar on friday slipping from 6 8482 a week ago just before trump raised tariffs a sharp change in the risk reversal measures in the yuan options market which indicates the bias towards the currency also showed investors were betting the currency will weaken however even with these dynamics there are firmer expectations the pboc won t tolerate a sharp sell off liam spillane who manages 11 5 billion in emerging market debt for aviva investors told reuters he was positioning his portfolio a little bit more defensively following renewed escalation in the trade war as a result spillane has cut exposure in indonesian government bonds and south african debt while adding small long dollar positions against the turkish lira and taiwanese dollar at the same time he is overweight the renminbi
david rowe s cartoon for friday 17th may 2019 david rowe aussie dollar hits 3 year low the economy may also be at an inflection point as evidenced by the australian dollar falling to a three year low this issue of wage growth is a really big issue says geoff weir economic growth is slowing house prices are still falling consumers are spending less on discretionary items wage growth is subdued and unemployment is edging up the real economy is pretty soft and i m getting a bit bearish says geoff weir a director at financial sector services who has consulted to the reserve bank of australia and treasury advertisement i don t think we re about to go into recession but i think we are heading for sluggish growth and potentially rising unemployment either party is going to find it difficult the rba has become less confident about the economy and will almost certainly cut interest rates within the next couple of months the central bank last week was forced to downgrade its outlook for the economy following weak inflation data softening consumer spending and a likely sharper downturn in housing construction on thursday official employment figures showed a mixed picture advertisement unemployment edged up to 5 2 per cent but total employment rose by 28 400 in april the rise in the jobless rate was due to more people looking for work which pushed up the participation rate to a record high 65 8 per cent yet leading indicators for the labour market including hiring intentions by employers measured by the nab business survey suggest employment growth will soon slow that means the long overdue stronger wage growth the rba and morrison government have been waiting for is unlikely to materialise in the near term scott morrison and bill shorten have both campaigned on being the best placed leader to handle the economic situation bill shorten or scott morrison will face challenges after the election dominic lorrimer morrison warns that economic headwinds mean now is not the time to risk a higher taxing higher spending labor government advertisement no talk of difficult reforms shorten argues only labor can generate better wage growth through direct government interventions such as lifting the minimum wage to a living wage paying subsidies for childcare workers restoring weekend penalty rates in some sectors and the potential return of industry wide bargaining for low wage occupations neither leader speaks much about the difficult economic reforms required to lift wages sustainably by achieving higher business productivity shadow treasurer chris bowen is anxious about inheriting a softening economy whoever is treasurer after saturday will be forced to again downgrade the federal budget s wage growth forecasts following the rba s recent move advertisement this issue of wage growth is a really big issue says weir it doesn t just feed into consumption but it also has a major impact on budgets the april budget forecast wage growth to rebound to 3 25 per cent in 2020 21 and 3 5 per cent in 2021 22 well above the current annual rate of 2 3 per cent if as expected the rba cuts rates from the already record low 1 5 per cent in the next couple of months the bank will move closer to running out of monetary policy ammunition near zero interest rates if rates drop to 1 per cent or below policymakers will confront the possibility of approaching near zero interest rates in that scenario the rba would like to see fiscal policy such as income tax cuts and infrastructure spending play a larger role in supporting the economy advertisement yet that would require either josh frydenberg or bowen to renege on their political priority of budget surpluses frydenberg has pledged a consistent return to surplus from 2019 20 onwards bowen has pledged bigger budget buffers to negate voter perceptions that labor is not as good at managing the budget yet those mildly contractionary fiscal policies notwithstanding some income tax cuts due through rebates to low income earners after they file their tax returns from july are at odds with an easing monetary policy i told you so the glass half empty economic outlook means some close observers think that if the coalition loses it might not be such a bad result in the long term advertisement if morrison is able to keep a loss to a respectable margin and the economy does weaken over the next term of government labor would be under pressure morrison or whoever is the liberal party leader post the election could turn around and say i told you so about the risks of labor managing the economy whether or not labor s proposed changes to industrial relations negative gearing capital gains tax breaks and franking credit cash refunds cause a negative impact any weakening of the economy on labor s watch would be easy fodder for the coalition separately challenging international headwinds await the next government australia s two most important economic partners china and the united states are again at loggerheads over trade and technology advertisement us president donald trump last week ratcheted up his trade war lifting tariffs to 25 per cent on us200 billion 290 billion of imports from china he is also threatening to hit the remaining us300 billion of goods imported from china with tariffs waiting out trump jpmorgan chief economist and head of global economic research bruce kasman told afr weekend on a visit to sydney this week the chance of a us china deal was not that much higher than 50 per cent i think the chinese are going to be put into a more difficult position to make compromises and secondly as the clock gets closer to 2020 there is more chance of the chinese waiting out the trump administration to see who comes next in the medium term a slower china would act as a drag on the world economy and hurt australia david rowe if a compromise isn t reached china s economy will likely slow down and that could be bad news for australian exports advertisement short term there could be benefits by china buying fewer american products and more australian exports such as agriculture and natural gas a china economic slowdown could also prompt the government to accelerate its infrastructure stimulus boosting demand for iron ore yet in the medium term a slower china would act as a drag on the world economy and hurt australia trump and president xi jinping are likely to come face to face at the group of 20 leaders meeting in japan in late june china is still bitter morrison or shorten will also be attending and will need to emphasise the importance of a de escalation in us china tensions advertisement if shorten makes the trip it will be one of his first big tests in foreign affairs china is still bitter about the coalition s hardening stance against china over the past 18 months public censoring of china for interference in the domestic political system banning chinese telecommunications giants from the 5g wireless network and calling out beijing for cyber hacking and intellectual property theft have strained the bilateral relationship richard mcgregor lowy institute senior fellow and china expert says australia s relationship with china is not back in the deep freezer but is being kept at a low temperature both sides whoever wins should expect to be tested by china after the election mcgregor says china would like to revisit the huawei decision but australia is unlikely to do that if labor wins china will be hoping for a reset in relations meanwhile closer to home papua new guinea is on the

joaquin temes why did cristina fernández de kirchner decide to step aside appointing her former cabinet chief alberto fernández as her presidential candidate to face mauricio macri in october was it a move of brilliant political strategy outmanoeuvring her opponents by capturing the nation s attention was she faster than mauricio macri and the so called rational peronists who under the banner of alternativa federal are still trying to decide who will fill the respective parties tickets could it have been an act of desperation as the first of several trials against the former president got underway especially after having failed to deactivate it with the help of her former supreme court allies or maybe it is an acknowledgement that despite macri s horrible approval ratings her own disapproval figures are such that she cannot win only when the election has come and gone will we be able to truly assess whether this outsize risk was brilliant utter recklessness or plain stupidity the same goes for president macri s intention to seek re election rather than stepping aside and allowing the strongest of cambiemos candidates such as buenos aires province governor maría eugenia vidal to partner up with a coalition member or even a peronist in order to beat the fernández fernández ticket if alberto s surprise appearance is any evidence the intensity of argentine politics coupled with the high level of undecided voters will lead to a few other surprises in the coming days weeks and months players like renewal front leader sergio massa the radical civic union ucr and roberto lavagna will also keep us on our toes a few weeks ago the country had been slapped in the face by the supreme court s decision to request the docket for the upcoming trial against fernández de kirchner leading to speculation that its potential delay was politically motivated protests ensued across buenos aires more affluent neighbourhoods forced to backtrack the supreme court justices argued it was a normal procedural request and that the trial should follow its scheduled timetable close to the leading cambiemos coalition many sensed a scent that reminded them of the golden years of kirchnerism alberto fernández in a televised interview in corea del centro show on net tv the mustachioed fernández told journalists maría o donnell and ernesto tenembaum that cfk s return to power would include an investigation into the judiciary one focused on those who pressed charges against her that was probably before he even knew he would be leading the ticket three days later on a sunny saturday morning cristina announced in a video with hastily recorded audio quality that alberto would lead the ticket it was at the heart of everything anyone spoke about for the ensuing weeks alberto can be useful for cristina in several ways a skilled politician and expert in the machiavellian arts of always landing on his feet alberto has a close relationship with massa to the point where he ran his 2015 presidential campaign convincing the renewal front leader to jump ship would result in the capsizing of alternativa federal and possibly give the fernández fernández ticket enough votes to fathom a victory in october no run off that is massa now finds himself in a tough spot having campaigned for three years more if we add the 2015 elections as an alternative to both macri and cristina now he is being forced to choose between what looks like a winning side and a dishevelled peronist line up that is haemorrhaging support daily while an electoral alliance with cristina would look and feel vulgar alberto allows him the opportunity of much less toxic photo op that s the same reason why several former kirchnerites that timidly supported alternativa federal have already offered an olive branch to the fernández fernández ticket governors including rosana bertone of tierra del fuego gerardo zamora of santiago del estero domingo peppo of chaco juan manzur of tucumán lucía corpacci of catamarca sergio casas of la rioja and of course alicia kirchner of santa cruz have expressed their support not only is it more enjoyable to negotiate with alberto it is also more palatable toward one s constituency in the aftermath of 12 years of kirchnerism and three and a half of macrismo another one of alberto s strengths is called clarín the former cabinet chief had a swell relationship with most of the media during his tenure which was before major outlets began investigating the kirchners corrupt practices with the notable exception of editorial perfil sa once out of the public service he was even accused by hardcore kirchnerites of defending grupo clarín ceo héctor magnetto s interests cristina s all out war with clarín occurred in the after alberto era since then the firm has won the business war solidifying its dominant position and getting the macri administration to allow the fusion of personal into fibertel cablevisión which along with telecom has created the country s largest telecommunications player to a certain extent cristina s crusade helped unmask the monster making clarín s business intentions clear to society which has weakaned the media side of the business meaning a cultural battle of sorts was won by the kirchnerites yet alberto s candidacy could lead to a truce so far this campaign cristina has kept true to her strategy of remaining silent her campaign acts include the narration of two videos one about her daughter florencia another announcing alberto s candidacy and her appearance at the buenos aires international book fair cristina knows that her public appearances repel undecided voters while attracting the faithful she ceded protagonism in last week s first official campaign rally that is why she will most probably focus her campaigning in buenos aires province otherwise known as the mother of all battles if the ks manage to seize the governorship from wunderkind vidal macri is almost surely toast it wasn t immediately clear whether alberto s lead role rather than cristina s had a positive or a negative impact initial surveys returned mixed results while financial markets remained relatively calm even if the effect was neutral it should be read as a victory for cfk s camp regardless it appears forced as macri s star political advisor jaime durán barba noted it will work against fernández de kirchner s aspirations softening the floor and lowering the ceiling in electoral terms cristina can count on one thing though whatever macri does he s currently stuck hovering around the worst figures of his presidency this story was originally published in the buenos aires times argentina s only english language newspaper

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by zheng li and kevin yao shanghai beijing reuters china s central bank will use foreign exchange intervention and monetary policy tools to stop the yuan weakening past the key 7 per dollar level in the near term three people familiar with the central bank s thinking said at present rest assured they will certainly not let it break 7 a source told reuters related stories a defense of the 7 level could help boost confidence in the currency and soothe investor fears about a sharp depreciation in the yuan or renminbi even as souring trade relations with washington make competitive devaluation a compelling option for beijing breaking 7 is beneficial to china because it can reduce some of the effects of tariff increases but the impact on our renminbi confidence is negative and funds will flow out the source said the yuan fell to its weakest level since december on friday and to within striking distance of the 7 mark last seen during the 2008 financial crisis it has weakened 3 percent in the past month on fading hopes of a deal being struck in the long running trade war between beijing and washington the latest flare up in those tensions saw u s president donald trump increase tariffs on chinese imports provoking a similar tariff rise from china although a weaker yuan would support chinese exporters the decline would need to be significant to offset the impact of higher u s tariffs such a fall could in turn fuel capital flight and undermine china s economic stability policy insiders said the source told reuters that china s issue of central bank bills in hong kong this week was a clear indication the people s bank of china s wanted to soak up offshore yuan to discourage investors from short selling it the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment on friday a second source familiar with the pboc s thinking said the monetary authority might tolerate the yuan weakening to 7 on fundamental factors but would act to prevent speculative short selling of the currency stability vs competitiveness a stable currency is imperative for china as it seeks to balance its investment driven economy attract more portfolio inflows and push for global equity and bond index inclusions the tightly managed currency fell heavily in 2018 and before that in 2015 when the pboc devalued the currency the stakes are much higher now said bryan carter head of emerging market fixed income at bnp paribas asset management in london a rapid devaluation would shake confidence in the local market and among domestic investors proving counterproductive carter said before reuters reported source comments on pboc china s balancing act goes beyond maintaining domestic confidence as the country s current account is seen swinging from a decades long surplus toward a deficit the yuan s exchange rate is expected to become more volatile a majority of more than 12 money managers traders and economists reuters spoke over the past week expected pboc to defend the renminbi while china primarily used direct dollar selling intervention in 2015 it switched to more unconventional methods such as tightening yuan funding costs and using swaps as the currency fell in 2018 the pboc re introduced a counter cyclical factor a secret component it uses in adjusting the daily reference point for the yuan s trading band in august last year market participants say it has been using that factor to temper depreciation expectations in the past week by setting a firmer benchmark for yuan than implied by the moves of global currencies i don t believe we will rely on yuan depreciation to boost exports the yuan is not only for facilitating foreign trade but it could also affect capital flows one of the sources said barring any sharp rise in the dollar the possibility for a near term dip in the yuan below 7 is relatively small going against this thinking is market positioning which points to further weakness in the offshore markets the currency s value one year out had weakened to 6 9770 per dollar on friday slipping from 6 8482 a week ago just before trump raised tariffs a sharp change in the risk reversal measures in the yuan options market which indicates the bias towards the currency also showed investors were betting the currency will weaken however even with these dynamics there are firmer expectations the pboc won t tolerate a sharp selloff liam spillane who manages 11 5 billion in emerging market debt for aviva investors told reuters he was positioning his portfolio a little bit more defensively following renewed escalation in the trade war as a result spillane has cut exposure in indonesian government bonds and south african debt while adding small long dollar positions against the turkish lira and taiwanese dollar at the same time he is overweight the renminbi we ve had a long held belief that chinese authorities will not allow the renminbi to materially depreciate we firmly believe they won t use the renminbi as a bargaining tool in the ongoing trade talks with the united states he said additional reporting by swati pandey in

open this photo in gallery chinese 100 yuan banknotes are counted at a branch of a commercial bank in beijing in this march 30 2016 file photo reuters photographer reuters china s central bank will use foreign exchange intervention and monetary policy tools to stop the yuan weakening past the key 7 per dollar level in the near term three people familiar with the central bank s thinking said at present rest assured they will certainly not let it break 7 a source told reuters a defence of the 7 level could help boost confidence in the currency and soothe investor fears about a sharp depreciation in the yuan or renminbi even as souring trade relations with washington make competitive devaluation a compelling option for beijing breaking 7 is beneficial to china because it can reduce some of the effects of tariff increases but the impact on our renminbi confidence is negative and funds will flow out the source said the yuan fell to its weakest level since december on friday and to within striking distance of the 7 mark last seen during the 2008 financial crisis it has weakened 3 per cent in the past month on fading hopes of a deal being struck in the long running trade war between beijing and washington the latest flare up in those tensions saw u s president donald trump increase tariffs on chinese imports provoking a similar tariff rise from china although a weaker yuan would support chinese exporters the decline would need to be significant to offset the impact of higher u s tariffs such a fall could in turn fuel capital flight and undermine china s economic stability policy insiders said the source told reuters that china s issue of central bank bills in hong kong this week was a clear indication the people s bank of china s wanted to soak up offshore yuan to discourage investors from short selling it the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment on friday a second source familiar with the pboc s thinking said the monetary authority might tolerate the yuan weakening to 7 on fundamental factors but would act to prevent speculative short selling of the currency stability vs competitiveness a stable currency is imperative for china as it seeks to balance its investment driven economy attract more portfolio inflows and push for global equity and bond index inclusions the tightly managed currency fell heavily in 2018 and before that in 2015 when the pboc devalued the currency the stakes are much higher now said bryan carter head of emerging market fixed income at bnp paribas asset management in london a rapid devaluation would shake confidence in the local market and among domestic investors proving counterproductive carter said before reuters reported source comments on pboc china s balancing act goes beyond maintaining domestic confidence as the country s current account is seen swinging from a decades long surplus toward a deficit the yuan s exchange rate is expected to become more volatile a majority of more than 12 money managers traders and economists reuters spoke over the past week expected pboc to defend the renminbi while china primarily used direct dollar selling intervention in 2015 it switched to more unconventional methods such as tightening yuan funding costs and using swaps as the currency fell in 2018 the pboc reintroduced a counter cyclical factor a secret component it uses in adjusting the daily reference point for the yuan s trading band in august last year market participants say it has been using that factor to temper depreciation expectations in the past week by setting a firmer benchmark for yuan than implied by the moves of global currencies i don t believe we will rely on yuan depreciation to boost exports the yuan is not only for facilitating foreign trade but it could also affect capital flows one of the sources said barring any sharp rise in the dollar the possibility for a near term dip in the yuan below 7 is relatively small going against this thinking is market positioning which points to further weakness in the offshore markets the currency s value one year out had weakened to 6 9770 per dollar on friday slipping from 6 8482 a week ago just before trump raised tariffs a sharp change in the risk reversal measures in the yuan options market which indicates the bias toward the currency also showed investors were betting the currency will weaken however even with these dynamics there are firmer expectations the pboc won t tolerate a sharp selloff liam spillane who manages 11 5 billion in emerging market debt for aviva investors told reuters he was positioning his portfolio a little bit more defensively following renewed escalation in the trade war as a result spillane has cut exposure in indonesian government bonds and south african debt while adding small long dollar positions against the turkish lira and taiwanese dollar at the same time he is overweight the renminbi we ve had a long held belief that chinese authorities will not allow the renminbi to materially depreciate we firmly believe they won t use the renminbi as a bargaining tool in the ongoing trade talks with the united states he said

history has never really been on the side of the federal labor party on the six previous occasions that labor came to power it found itself in the eye of a global storm the entry dates to office underline both the burden and the bad luck 1914 1929 1940 1972 1983 and 2007 that covers both world wars and the four biggest crises of modern capitalism the great depression the oil shock stagflation and the global financial crisis it is one of the most striking things about our political system the australian people shift to labor in times of national peril and in most cases quickly come to regret that choice three of those economic crises erupted within the opening year of the new government cruelling the prime ministerships of james scullin gough whitlam and kevin rudd all three lost their jobs within three years of a barnstorming election victory scullin s government split and was forced to an early election which it lost in a landslide whitlam s government was dismissed by the governor general while rudd was sacked by his own party only bob hawke s government in 1983 had the benefit of knowing the enemy on arrival the economy was already in deep recession and his ministry had witnessed the chaos of the whitlam era and were determined not to repeat that history so if bill shorten does lead labor back into government the question of what could go wrong will occur soon enough it is the follow up question that will decide whether his government rises to the challenge like hawke s what did shorten and his frontbench learn from the rudd experience
across the kangra valley in the hills below the snow capped peaks of the himalayas the promise of a modern railway reverberated like the beginning of something vital access to jobs hospitals universities and shops many villages were connected to the rest of the country by rutted dirt roads and a rickety railway erected by the british a century ago during the monsoon landslides blocked trains and flooded roads rendering them impassable narendra modi then running for prime minister had come to the region in 2014 promising liberation a new rail line would provide fast and reliable train service but five years later with modi seeking re election villagers look down the bluff at the old tracks with a mix of disgust and resignation nothing has happened here says lata devi 55 i

kangra valley in himachal pradesh india photograph rebecca conway the new york times as india this sunday reaches the end of the world s largest election which began last month modi is confronting anger over his failure to deliver on the promise that brought him to office economic revitalisation the prime minister has drawn praise for paring india s legendary bureaucracy he has altered perceptions that his country was hostile to business but he has failed to spur significant economic growth in part because of his disappointing record in reviving stalled infrastructure projects the prime minister has championed rail road and electrical links as a means of furthering development across this country of 1 3 billion people although road building has proceeded aggressively infrastructure overall has fallen short during the last three months of 2018 investments in new projects slumped to their lowest level during modi s tenure according to the center for monitoring indian economy an independent research organisation in mumbai the fall after 2016 has been quite severe says mahesh vyas the centre s managing director he thought he could solve all those things with

minister inherited a troubling condition that has plagued india for decades what economic growth the country generates does not produce enough jobs he vowed to create 10 million jobs a year as a former chief minister of his home state of gujarat widely hailed as india s most entrepreneurial he was celebrated as a leader who could harness india s natural resources intellectual prowess and enormous workforce toward industrialising but a signature programme make in india which aimed to help manufacturing has produced a bumper crop of public pronouncements and scant hiring in part because the nation s patchy infrastructure has discouraged investment the unemployment rate climbed to a 45 year high of 6 1 per cent last year from 2 2 per cent in 2011 according to the government s national sample survey nonetheless modi has won the ardour of the masses with his appeals to hindu nationalism and his military confrontations with india s nemesis pakistan he is widely expected to claim re

he is a great man says ajai singh managing director of glenmoor cottages a collection of private residences in a grove of towering cedar trees in dharamshala a bjp flag flies from his rooftop he hasn t achieved anything singh says later he will get another term and then we will see results the economy has expanded by a robust 7 3 per cent annually during modi s tenure better than the 6 7 per cent rate in the previous five years according to official numbers but many economists accuse the administration of doctoring the data the government was willing to play with numbers to score a point says amiya kumar bagchi an economist at the institute of development studies kolkata the numbers are wrong and possibly fabricated he adds some of india s problems are beyond the scope of any national leader the american central bank the federal reserve has lifted interest rates making the dollar relatively more rewarding for investors and prompting an exodus of money from emerging markets oil prices have soared lifting fuel prices rupee ban but some of india s troubles flow directly from modi s actions not least his disastrous 2016 move to ban most indian rupee notes in a bid to disrupt finance for terrorists and black marketeers the government failed to have new notes ready creating a crippling shortage in an economy dominated by cash anek kumar who commutes from his village to work

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com global m a activity continued to accelerate in the first half of 2018 following the strong end to 2017 a year that was marked by several headline making megadeals deals valued above us 10 billion buoyed by record stock market highs gdp growth and low borrowing costs global deal value in 2018 reached us 3 53 trillion an increase of 11 5 per cent as compared to 2017 and the thirdhighest value on record according to mergermarket global deal activity in 2018 was driven largely by strategic transactions with many companies seeking to strengthen their competitive position in the market by pursuing scope deals that gave them something new such as new capabilities or access to new markets overall cross border transactions accounted for a lower percentage of total global m a deals in 2018 as compared to 2017 globally the value of leveraged buyouts increased by 25 per cent in 2018 as private equity funds increasingly participated in public toprivate deals campaigns and capital deployed by activist investors seeking m a initiatives and board changes continued to have a significant influence on corporate strategy in 2018 the record high valuations seen at the end of 2017 continued in 2018 with 26 of the 36 total megadeals taking place in the first half of the year before deal activity declined in the second half of 2018 particularly during the last quarter average deal value increased by 19 6 per cent in 2018 as compared to 2017 but an overall decline in the number of deals in 2018 suggests some buyers may be more cautious regarding m a activity despite the record breaking first half of 2018 the second half of the year saw a significant drop in m a activity particularly during q4 the prospect of a no deal brexit in europe looks set to be a focal point for businesses through 2019 with deal activity in the u k cooling until there is greater certainty regarding the u k s future relationship with the eu trade wars between the u s china and europe are expected to continue along with the volatility in global stock markets we expect that the impact of these factors on m a activity in 2019 may be offset by vast cash resources private equity dry powder looking to be deployed and the prominence of activist investors seeking m a initiatives involving the sale of a company or spin off of businesses the united states in 2018 the u s experienced another year of healthy m a activity driven by a record breaking stock market robust economic growth and the u s tax reform that was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2017 deal value in the u s increased by 15 4 per cent to us 1 3 trillion in 2018 as compared to 2017 the second highest value on record according to mergermarket president donald trump s tax reform reducing the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent and shifting position on the repatriation of overseas profits into the u s contributed to m a activity in 2018 u s companies put their cash reserves to use increasingly consolidating their strategic position while also participating in large share buyback plans the prevalence of domestic deals in 2018 is indicative of the liquidity that is in the hands of u s companies we expect domestic m a activity to remain strong in 2019 despite the challenges in u s politics and the 2020 election in sight partly as a result of companies looking to take advantage of the recent tax reform we saw a rise in u s megadeals in 2018 with a total of 18 announced as compared to 15 in 2017 megadeal activity coincided with regulatory approvals of at t s us 105 billion acquisition of time warner and bayer s us 66 billion acquisition of monsanto two of the largest megadeals to be completed in the u s in 2018 following their announcement in q3 2016 total deal value is expected to remain high in 2019 whilst the economic conditions in the u s and abroad remain conducive for deal activity the federal reserve raised interest rates four times in 2018 each by 0 25 per cent with policymakers anticipating two further raises in 2019 towards a median target of 3 per cent by 2020 as interest rates the cost of servicing debt and equity market volatility increase buyers may focus further on consolidating their strategic position over pursuing opportunistic acquisitions technology continues to be a significant sector with the potential to reshape entire industries technology companies entering new sectors are expected to continue to influence m a deal activity in addition nontechnology companies seeking to acquire technology companies along with strategic consolidation within the sector contributed significantly to m a activity in the u s and abroad during 2018 in august 2018 the legal authority and scope of the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius was expanded through the foreign investment risk review modernization act of 2018 firrma notable changes included the widening of the jurisdiction for cfius to review transactions between foreign persons and u s businesses the legislation includes a focus on critical technologies businesses that relate to critical infrastructure and businesses involved in the collection or maintenance of sensitive personal data of u s citizens the long term effects of firrma remain unclear but its introduction coincided with a dramatic decrease in inbound m a from china into the u s further it is difficult to predict how far the regulations will go to curtail foreign investment in u s businesses in its current form cfius has broad scope to review any m a activity between a u s business and a foreign investor and we expect foreign investment into the u s to be subject to further regulation in 2019 separately from cfius the u s has been involved in an ongoing trade war with china and has had trade friction with europe and canada president trump introduced tariffs on aluminium and steel products primarily targeted toward these jurisdictions which each have counteracted with tariffs of their own on u s goods the u s and china each have imposed tariffs of us 250 billion and us 110 billion respectively on the other country s goods further in may 2018 president trump announced that the u s would be withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal following this the u s sanctions programme with a particular focus on iran was heightened in november and extended to companies trying to do any kind of business in iran the effect of these sanctions combined with all other existing sanctions is another factor that might have a negative impact on m a activity outside of the u s europe in europe m a activity reached us 989 2 billion in 2018 its highest level since the financial crisis despite the political uncertainty in europe m a continued to shine particularly in the first half of 2018 with cross border deals in europe being particularly prominent this surge in activity was driven by foreign investment into europe which in light of brexit negotiations and a strong u s dollar saw u s businesses particularly interested in acquiring european assets brexit remains the most significant challenge for m a activity in the u k following the publication of the eu s draft withdrawal agreement the historic defeat of prime minister theresa may s brexit deal in parliament and the growing question of border control between ireland and northern ireland the prospect of a no deal brexit poses a number of unknown risks to u k businesses we observed a decline in m a activity in europe s largest markets during the second half of 2018 with the u k france and germany all recording significant drops in total deal value compared to the first half of 2018 there was a record number of activist campaigns and companies targeted globally as well as in europe in 2018 m a initiatives accounted for 33 per cent of all activist campaigns globally in 2018 in europe a total of 58 activist campaigns were initiated in 2018 as compared to 52 in 2017 q4 2018 was the most active quarter for activist campaigns and set a record for the amount of capital deployed notwithstanding the decrease in the total value and volume of m a deals during the same period across europe the rise of protectionist policies may result in a greater number of deals being blocked by domestic regulators the proposed eu regulation on foreign direct investment is due to be implemented in early 2019 with member states implementing it through their own national legislation in germany two acquisitions by chinese investors were blocked in 2018 on grounds of national security with other countries including the u k currently reviewing proposed legislation to be implemented in 2019 there is mixed sentiment towards the impact new foreign investment laws will have on overseas investment but as the new rules will likely be limited to particular sectors and technologies we do not expect them to have a significant impact in 2019 on inbound m a activity into europe political uncertainty in europe was constant during 2018 with angela merkel announcing in october that she will step down as germany s chancellor in 2021 spain suffering from a lack of parliamentary majority and italy transitioning into a new populist government despite this background of uncertainty m a deal volume increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 and such m a activity in continental europe suggests significant m a activity can continue in 2019 asia m a activity in asia continues to be dominated by china and japan but for the first time there has been notable m a activity in india according to mergermarket deal activity in asia reached the second highest value of all time in 2018 despite a slow q3 in 2018 chinese acquisitions of u s companies dropped by 94 6 per cent as compared to 2017 chinese investors faced increasing scrutiny by overseas regulators and governments particularly in the u s in addition trade policies of the trump administration have soured the relationship between the two countries and have continued to dampen outbound m a activity from china the slowdown of china s outbound investments is also due to china s tightened foreign exchange which is in turn driven by china s dwindling foreign exchange reserves and downward pressure of the renminbi we expect china s outbound deal activity aside from deal activity with the u s to remain strong through 2019 in line with the one belt one road initiative this initiative includes a wide scope of encouraged investments in order to further enhance china s capabilities with europe and central asia further in september 2018 the china securities regulatory commission revised the code of corporate governance for listed companies which seeks to boost the appeal of investment into china from overseas investors as japan s abenomics enters its sixth year its deal activity has seen a marked increase in light of the effects of quantitative easing and low borrowing costs japan s outbound m a activity to the u s has increased since 2017 and in the face of reduced competition from chinese companies it appears that japanese bidders are considered safe buyers by u s regulators india saw its m a activity reach an all time high of us 99 9 billion in 2018 which included the us 16 billion acquisition by u s headquartered walmart of flipkart india s leading online retailer we expect that outbound m a will remain steady through 2019 with china increasingly focusing on european targets while japan targets investment into the u s conclusion looking toward 2019 there are various cautionary signs that may impact m a activity including rising interest rates ongoing trade wars and stock market volatility however there are many positive factors that suggest m a activity will remain robust in 2019 the imperative for companies to utilise cash reserves to strategically grow remains while significant levels of private equity deal activity and the rise in activist campaigns look to continue in the absence of any dramatic change in economic conditions the effects of the u s tax reform make u s businesses wellpositioned to grow through m a with strategic consolidation likely to continue with technology remaining a key sector for buyers from other sectors we anticipate political uncertainty in europe to reduce once there is greater clarity regarding the u k s future relationship with the eu in the meantime european targets are expected to remain attractive assets to inbound investment from u s and asian buyers as cash reserves are increasingly deployed in cross border deals despite china s declining investment into the u s asian domestic and outbound activity is expected to remain consistent with that of 2018 as businesses search for greater exposure to technologies infrastructure and foreign real estate originally published in iclg the content of this article is intended to

the idea that china could sell its vast horde of u s treasuries in retaliation for the trump administration s tariffs has been called the nuclear option in the trade war but new data suggests it could be more of a bottle rocket an article that ran in politico and the south china morning post last week explained the fear china could fire back by dumping its vast holdings of u s government debt flooding the market with treasuries would push down us bond prices and cause the yields to spike it claimed data released this week shows that china cut its treasury holdings by nearly 20 5 billion in march the fastest pace of selling in more than two years china has reduced its holdings all but three months since last june when president donald trump slapped a 25 percent tariff on 50 billion of chinese imports but far from hurting the ability of the u s government to issue debt or driving down the price of treasuries china s selling has been accompanied by treasury prices moving up and yields moving down the yield on 10 year treasuries was 3 09 on november first on wednesday it was 2 37 in march the 10 year yield fell from 2 76 to 2 41 yields move in the opposite direction of prices so falling yields indicate bond prices rising the bond sales represent just a small portion of china s 1 12 trillion treasury holdings but taken together the sales over the 12 month period ending in march amount to a 5 6 percent reduction that is a significant change in china s holdings with no impact on bond prices we ve been through this before in 2016 china sold about 188 billion of treasuries 15 of its portfolio treasury yields hit record lows if china were to attempt to sell its entire portfolio all at once that probably would have at least a temporary effect on yields that much supply coming into the market all at once would set traders scrambling and push down bond prices until an orderly market could be restored and prices would recover but in the meantime it would inflict significant financial losses on china the largest foreign holder of treasuries depleting its foreign currency reserves most forecasters expect china would take a gradual approach to shrinking its holdings according to jeff cox at cnbc ubs estimates that a big reduction in china s holdings would result in the 10 year yield rising just 0 4 percent that would still leave yields below where they stood last summer hardly the equivalent of dropping an atomic bomb on the u s economy ironically heavy chinese selling could actually send yields downward at least temporarily if investors saw it as a sign of an escalation in the trade war to the extent that china s treasury sales could be either the cause or the effect of a more risk averse global environment the positive impact on treasury yields could be smaller than estimated if private investors step up their treasury purchases ubs strategist chirag mirani and others said in a note to clients according to cnbc that s what happened last week on the friday before trump announced the tariff hike the 10 year yield was 2 54 it fell to 2 40 on the first trading day after the higher levies took effect china s significance in the treasury market has declined in recent years at its 2012 peak china s holdings amounted to 12 percent of u s debt outstanding now it is just 7 percent it s also helpful to remember that an average of 500 billion or so of treasuries trade hands every day so china s entire holdings amounts to under two and a half days worth of volume most likely the recent selling has not been an attempt to drive up the borrowing costs of the u s government but to prop up its own currency the yuan has depreciated 7 3 against the dollar over the past year the makes its exports cheaper offsetting at least some of the effect of the u s tariffs but it also reduces the buying power of chinese consumers and businesses and could prompt capital flight from the country foreign accounts sold a total of 12 6 billion in march the 11th consecutive month of selling but this has had little if any effect on yields which bounced around a bit last year and have been falling ever since the fed changed its policy from gradual hikes to patience the lack of response in bond yields to foreign sales should not be surprising in general the long term yield of u s government bonds reflects the expected path of short term rates which in turn is based on where investors think the fed will set the overnight rate think of a long term bond as being composed of a series of short term bonds inflation expectations may play a role because investors presumably would demand higher returns if they expect inflation to rise but since the fed targets inflation it s not clear that inflation expectations do anything that expectations for short term rates are not already doing there s also an odd sort of risk premium built into the price of treasuries according to economists investors cannot be certain their predictions about short term rates are correct especially five years or so into the future so economists think bond prices include a term premia a little extra return on longer term bonds that would cushion the cost of getting future rates wrong for example right now the yield on the 10 year is around 2 4 suppose that the interest rate on the 1 year u s treasury is expected to be around 2 2 percent over the next 10 years then the term premium on the 10 year u s treasury note would be about 0 2 percent note that since investor expectations cannot be directly observed calculating the term premia is a lot more complicated than that in fact economists cannot even agree with each other on how it should be calculated not only do economists not agree on how to calculate the term premia some are skeptical that it even exists arguing that long rates are fully determined by short rates expectations in this view the term premia is an illusion created by the mismeasurement of expectations others say that it exists but is caused by something other than uncertainty perhaps imbalances between supply and demand tax distortions or some types of investors preferring certain durations over others for idiosyncratic reasons there exist at least a few bond traders who maintain that the term premia is 100 percent reflexivity the term premia is created solely by expectations of the term premia itself that is the term premia rises and falls in accordance with investor expectations that future investors will demand a term premia none of this leaves much room for foreign investors attacking the u s by selling government bonds china cannot force bond yields up on anything more than a very short term basis if at all by selling treasuries if china no longer wanted to accumulate american dollars and dollar denominated assets it would need to reverse the enormous trade surplus it runs with the u s that is extremely unlikely china s bond holdings are not so much a nuclear arsenal it can wield against the u s as they are fireworks that might garner some attention but not do much harm

history has never really been on the side of the federal labor party on the six previous occasions that labor came to power it found itself in the eye of a global storm the entry dates to office underline both the burden and the bad luck 1914 1929 1940 1972 1983 and 2007 that covers both world wars and the four biggest crises of modern capitalism the great depression the oil shock stagflation and the global financial crisis it is one of the most striking things about our political system the australian people shift to labor in times of national peril and in most cases quickly come to regret that choice three of those economic crises erupted within the opening year of the new government cruelling the prime ministerships of james scullin gough whitlam and kevin rudd all three lost their jobs within three years of a barnstorming election victory scullin s government split and was forced to an early election which it lost in a landslide whitlam s government was dismissed by the governor general while rudd was sacked by his own party only bob hawke s government in 1983 had the benefit of knowing the enemy on arrival the economy was already in deep recession and his ministry had witnessed the chaos of the whitlam era and were determined not to repeat that history so if bill shorten does lead labor back into government the question of what could go wrong will occur soon enough it is the follow up question that will decide whether his government rises to the challenge like hawke s what did shorten and his frontbench learn from the rudd experience

asian markets once again decouple from the us while us stocks staged a strong rebound overnight asian indices are generally mixed weakness is indeed seen in china s shanghai sse while yuan resumes recent free fall there is some negative reaction to report that china is not eager to resume trade negotiations with us for now though there is no official comments from both sides on when the meeting will resume us treasury secretary steven mnuchin said that the delegation will travel to beijing soon but trade representative robert lighthizer kept his lips tight in the currency markets yen is mildly firmer again today followed by swiss franc and then euro canadian dollar is currently the weakest for today followed by aussie and then sterling for the week yen and swiss franc remain the joint winners followed by dollar pound is the worst performing one followed by aussie and then kiwi technically consolidation in yen crosses continued overnight with mild recovery but there is not

25 tariff on around us 300b in chinese goods is controllable the government has implemented and will continue to carry forward measures to keep growth in a reasonable range and the measures will target to stabilize areas such as consumption investment and employment also ndrc noted the government will also keep bettering its business environment and leveling the playing field to ensure the sustainability of investments separately bloomberg reported that china is not very keen in resuming trade negotiations with us quoting a mysterious blog taoran notes the blog is believed to be backed by the government and is one of the few voices on china s negotiations strategy in a censored internet world in the country the blog piece noted we can t see the u s has any substantial sincerity in pushing forward the talks rather it is expanding extreme pressure if the u s ignores the will of the chinese people then it probably won t get an effective response from the chinese side it added fed kashkari we misread faulty labor market signals but cutting rates won t help inflation expectations minneapolis fed president neel kashkari said in a speech in santa barbara that fed could have misread faulty signals from the labor markets and current situation suggests monetary policy was too tight in this recovery fed should be patient and allow inflation to overshoot target yet he doesn t see cutting rates offer any help overall he advocates a wait and see with patience approach kashkari said fed could have misread the labor market and feared that if we hit maximum employment inflation might suddenly accelerate thus we would then have to raise rates quickly to contain it however the headline unemployment rate has been giving a faulty signal considering inflation somewhat too low and job market still showing capacity he added the only reasonable conclusion i can draw is that monetary policy has been too tight in this recovery on monetary policy kashkari said for our current framework to be effective and credible we must walk the walk and actually allow inflation to climb modestly above 2 percent in order to demonstrate that we are serious about symmetry however he also told reporters that i am not sure that cutting rates would do much to inflation expectations brainard fed might adopt opportunistic reflation strategy on monetary policy fed lael brainard said in a speech the central might adopt a so called opportunistic reflation strategy to lift underlying inflation to 2 and underscore its commitment to the inflation mandate such a strategy would accept a slight overshoot the 2 inflation target for a while even if it s driven by import prices she said suppose that an unexpected increase in core import price inflation drove overall inflation modestly above 2 for a couple of years the federal reserve could use that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals and to align policy with that statement on the current outlook she noted the emerging contours of today s new normal are defined by low sensitivity of inflation to changes in labor market slack a low long term neutral rate of interest and low underlying trend inflation businessnz manufacturing pmi rose to 53 0 growth pickup still in questions new zealand businessnz manufacturing pmi rose to 53 0 in april up from 52 0 looking at the

businessnz s executive director for manufacturing catherine beard said that while the improvement in activity for april was welcome the underlying trend still remains a concern she noted although this indicates the sector is still in expansion mode the unadjusted series has tended to trend down since late 2017 if this trend continues it will eventually have negative consequences for the main published result bnz senior economist doug steel said that the headline pmi looks reasonable but some of the details have cooled off including new orders it raises questions for those looking for a

hour 55 ema and 110 03 minor resistance intraday bias remains neutral first and recent fall is expected to resume sooner rather than later on the downside break of 109 02 will resume the fall from 112 40 to retest 104 69 low nevertheless break of 110 04 minor resistance will indicate short term bottom lengthier consolidation could then be seen before another decline in the bigger picture usd jpy is staying inside falling channel from 118 65 currently development suggests that rebound from 104 69 is only a corrective move and fall from 118 65 is not completed yet decisive break of 104 69 will

fluid situations global markets took an upbeat tone overnight preferring to concentrate on known knowns rather than known unknowns or unknown unknowns following washington s decision to place huawei on a blacklist that could ban them from sourcing vital us technology if enacted the street appears to have temporarily given up trying to predict the fluid situation that is us china trade relations and concentrate on the here and now the here and now on wall street was strong us housing starts and sparkling results from heavyweights walmart nvidia and cisco systems suggesting yet again that despite the international noise the us economy is still moving full steam ahead following rises yesterday in europe and china the s p finished 0 90 higher the nasdaq climbed 1 and the dow jones rose 0 80 european union inflation and the us michigan consumer sentiment are the heavyweight data points due this evening to finish the week they could tell a tale of two halves with the us consumer alive and well while eu inflation continues bumping along the floor here in asia the new zealand dollar nzd continued its weekly fall following uninspiring ppi data this morning we have important data from two trading bellwethers in asia today singapore released its balance of trade at 0830 singapore time sgt while hong kong releases its quarterly gdp growth rate at 1630 sgt the street will be looking for a continued recovery in singapore s non oil exports and a bounce back in hong kong s quarterly gdp growth following a slump of 0 50 previously like australia and new zealand singapore and hong kong have a massive correlation to china growth and the data will be closely watched to gauge the state of play in asian trade poor prints could see a negative overflow to regional markets currencies the us dollar maintained its tight grip on markets overnight following a strong performance by wall street with the dollar index rising 0 27 the australian aud and new zealand dollars nzd continued their slump with tomorrow s aussie elections weighing heavily on the former the aud fell 0 50 to 0 6890 with the 2016 lows around 0 6830 now in plain sight the euro fell ahead of upcoming european elections to 1 1175 while the british pound gbp continued its terrible run falling below 1 2795 on brexit uncertainty the chances of a feasible brexit solution being achieved seem to be falling by the day much like the governments chance of re election any light at the end of the tunnel being a train coming the other way equities assuming no surprises from singapore data or president trump s twitter account regional markets should follow wall street s lead and begin the day on a positive note the march higher will be tentative at best though with sentiment both incredibly cautious and fragile with the weekend upon us and plenty of unknown unknowns that could occur over the weekend volumes will likely remain light in asia today oil middle east tensions were front and centre overnight as saudi arabia unsurprisingly blamed iran for the recent sabotage on its tankers and oil platforms brent crude rose 1 15 to usd72 70 a barrel and wti climbed 1 65 to usd63 05 a barrel the repricing of geopolitical threats has merit although the likelihood of open hostilities from or against iran remains low in my opinion brent crude has technical resistance in the usd75 00 a barrel area and wti nearby at usd63 50 with quite a lot of politics and supply crunches already built into prices and the spectre of trade wars looming large the geopolitical temperature will probably have to ratchet much higher to maintain a sustained rally through the resistance levels gold gold collapsed by usd10 to usd1 285 00 an ounce overnight erasing its entire week s gains in one fell swoop a strong dollar and bond yields creeping higher took their toll however a global sense of disbelief that the trade wars will be taken to the wire drained the safe haven harbour flushing gold out with it the fall overnight will be tremendously disappointing to gold bulls as the yellow metal exhibited a rise up the stairs down via the 10th floor window price action gold remains in a broader usd1 280 00 1 300 00 consolidation phase what was emphasised by the overnight price action was that gold s fate is not its own and unless there is some news today asian trading will likely be tepid at best
the policy differences between the two major political parties vying for power at australian elections on saturday have been described as the widest divide at a federal contest in 26 years the center left opposition labor party is regarded as pursuing a big target strategy with a diverse range of policies aimed at creating a more equitable society under the slogan a fair go for australia to give someone a fair go is an australian colloquialism for providing justice the conservative liberal party led coalition government is promising a steady course in uncertain times under the banner building our economy securing your future the government warns voters that australia s slowing economy would be damaged by labor s ambitious agenda here are some of the policy differences ___ china the liberal and labor parties have promised different approaches toward australia s most important trading partner china after relations have strained in recent years over issues including australia s ban on covert foreign interference in domestic politics and foreign political donations but both parties have been short on specifics the liberal led coalition government has upset beijing by blocking chinese companies from buying a cattle empire and sydney electricity provider and by banning chinese technology giant huawei from australia s 5g telecommunications network rollout this year former labor prime minister paul keating last week angered the government by describing australian intelligence agency bosses as nutters who had damaged relations with china by warning against chinese investments in sensitive australian infrastructure labor leader bill shorten has distanced himself from keating s comments but shorten suggested australia needed to rebalance it relationship with china warning against viewing china s rise solely through the prism of strategic risk labor accused prime minister scott morrison of offending chinese this week when he described them as australia s customers while the united states were australia s friends morrison had been arguing against australia taking sides in the trade dispute between china and the united states australia s most important security ally you stand by your friends and you stand by your customers as well morrison said australia has bilateral free trade agreement with both china and the united states ___ climate change labor has pledge to reduce australia s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050 the coalition government has committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 by 2030 and warns that labor s more ambitious target would wreck the economy the liberals are critical of labor s failure to put a monetary cost on the target labor argues that failure to act on climate change would also cost the economy energy policy is a contentious issue in a country that s the world biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas australia has been one of the world s worst carbon polluters on a per capita basis due to heavy reliance on coal fired electricity labor wants half of australia s electricity generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030 and would offer rebates for households to buy solar batteries labor has also set a target to make electric cars account for half the new cars sold in australia by 2030 the liberals would spend 2 billion australian dollars 1 4 billion by 2030 on paying major polluters to reduce their emissions labor has also adopted aspects of the liberals scrapped national energy guarantee policy the program that placed on power generators a reliability obligation as well as emissions reduction obligation led to the overthrow of former prime minister malcolm turnbull by government colleagues who were opposed to any carbon reduction measures that increased the price of electricity ___ refugees the liberal led government has all but stopped asylum seekers from coming to australia by boats after 50 000 arrived on australian shores during labor s most recent six years in office the government has turned away 80 boats either sending them back to southeast asian ports or banishing the asylum seekers to immigration camps on the poor pacific island nations of papua new guinea and nauru labor takes some credit for that success noting the current policy of refusing to allow refugees who come by boat from ever settling in australia was adopted in the final weeks of a labor administration in 2013 but labor has committed to continue with the government s secretive military led operation sovereign borders the liberals say a labor government would encourage asylum seekers to come to australia by boat again by abolishing temporary protection visas the government only gives boat arrivals protection visas for three years they can be sent back to their homelands if the circumstances they fled from improve labor would give them permanent protection visas to provide certainty in their lives the liberals have capped australia s refugee intake at 18 750 while labor wants to lift the number to 27 000 the liberals also want to repeal a law passed by parliament by their opponents in february that reduces obstacles faced by asylum seekers seeking medical evacuations from papua new guinea and nauru ___ landlord tax breaks labor plans to reduce tax breaks for landlords which the

canberra australia the policy differences between the two major political parties vying for power at australian elections on saturday have been described as the widest divide at a federal contest in 26 years the centre left opposition labor party is regarded as pursuing a big target strategy with a diverse range of policies aimed at creating a more equitable society under the slogan a fair go for australia to give someone a fair go is an australian colloquialism for providing justice the conservative liberal party led coalition government is promising a steady course in uncertain times under the banner building our economy securing your future the government warns voters that australia s slowing economy would be damaged by labor s ambitious agenda here are some of the policy differences ___ china the liberal and labor parties have promised different approaches toward australia s most important trading partner china after relations have strained in recent years over issues including australia s ban on covert foreign interference in domestic politics and foreign political donations but both parties have been short on specifics the liberal led coalition government has upset beijing by blocking chinese companies from buying a cattle empire and sydney electricity provider and by banning chinese technology giant huawei from australia s 5g telecommunications network rollout this year former labor prime minister paul keating last week angered the government by describing australian intelligence agency bosses as nutters who had damaged relations with china by warning against chinese investments in sensitive australian infrastructure labour leader bill shorten has distanced himself from keating s comments but shorten suggested australia needed to rebalance it relationship with china warning against viewing china s rise solely through the prism of strategic risk labour accused prime minister scott morrison of offending chinese this week when he described them as australia s customers while the united states were australia s friends morrison had been arguing against australia taking sides in the trade dispute between china and the united states australia s most important security ally you stand by your friends and you stand by your customers as well morrison said australia has bilateral free trade agreement with both china and the united states ___ climate change labor has pledge to reduce australia s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050 the coalition government has committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 by 2030 and warns that labor s more ambitious target would wreck the economy the liberals are critical of labor s failure to put a monetary cost on the target labor argues that failure to act on climate change would also cost the economy energy policy is a contentious issue in a country that s the world biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas australia has been one of the world s worst carbon polluters on a per capita basis due to heavy reliance on coal fired electricity labour wants half of australia s electricity generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030 and would offer rebates for households to buy solar batteries labor has also set a target to make electric cars account for half the new cars sold in australia by 2030 the liberals would spend 2 billion australian dollars 1 4 billion by 2030 on paying major polluters to reduce their emissions labour has also adopted aspects of the liberals scrapped national energy guarantee policy the program that placed on power generators a reliability obligation as well as emissions reduction obligation led to the overthrow of former prime minister malcolm turnbull by government colleagues who were opposed to any carbon reduction measures that increased the price of electricity ___ refugees the liberal led government has all but stopped asylum seekers from coming to australia by boats after 50 000 arrived on australian shores during labor s most recent six years in office the government has turned away 80 boats either sending them back to southeast asian ports or banishing the asylum seekers to immigration camps on the poor pacific island nations of papua new guinea and nauru labor takes some credit for that success noting the current policy of refusing to allow refugees who come by boat from ever settling in australia was adopted in the final weeks of a labor administration in 2013 but labor has committed to continue with the government s secretive military led operation sovereign borders the liberals say a labor government would encourage asylum seekers to come to australia by boat again by abolishing temporary protection visas the government only gives boat arrivals protection visas for three years they can be sent back to their homelands if the circumstances they fled from improve labour would give them permanent protection visas to provide certainty in their lives the liberals have capped australia s refugee intake at 18 750 while labor wants to lift the number to 27 000 the liberals also want to repeal a law passed by parliament by their opponents in february that reduces obstacles faced by asylum seekers seeking medical evacuations from papua new guinea and nauru ___ landlord tax breaks labour plans to reduce tax breaks for landlords which the liberals warn will accelerate a decline in house prices in major cities labour argues that property investors are squeezing first home buyers out of the housing market because the tax regime gives landlords an unfair advantage from next year landlords will only be able to claim tax deductions for losses from their property investments if the properties are new the aim is to encourage property investors to build new homes instead of competing for existing stock against people looking for a home the tax discount that landlords can claim from selling properties would be reduced from 50 to 25 the new rules will not apply to landlords who buy properties before jan 1 the liberals argue that the changes will reduce the value of all homes rod mcguirk the associated press

australia to give someone a fair go is an australian colloquialism for providing justice the conservative liberal party led coalition government is promising a steady course in uncertain times under the banner building our economy securing your future the government warns voters that australia s slowing economy would be damaged by labor s ambitious agenda here are some of the policy differences ___ china the liberal and labor parties have promised different approaches toward australia s most important trading partner china after relations have strained in recent years over issues including australia s ban on covert foreign interference in domestic politics and foreign political donations but both parties have been short on specifics the liberal led coalition government has upset beijing by blocking chinese companies from buying a cattle empire and sydney electricity provider and by banning chinese technology giant huawei from australia s 5g telecommunications network rollout this year former labor prime minister paul keating last week angered the government by describing australian intelligence agency bosses as nutters who had damaged relations with china by warning against chinese investments in sensitive australian infrastructure labour leader bill shorten has distanced himself from keating s comments but shorten suggested australia needed to rebalance it relationship with china warning against viewing china s rise solely through the prism of strategic risk labour accused prime minister scott morrison of offending chinese this week when he described them as australia s customers while the united states were australia s friends morrison had been arguing against australia taking sides in the trade dispute between china and the united states australia s most important security ally you stand by your friends and you stand by your customers as well morrison said australia has bilateral free trade agreement with both china and the united states ___ climate change labor has pledge to reduce australia s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050 the coalition government has committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 by 2030 and warns that labor s more ambitious target would wreck the economy the liberals are critical of labor s failure to put a monetary cost on the target labor argues that failure to act on climate change would also cost the economy energy policy is a contentious issue in a country that s the world biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas australia has been one of the world s worst carbon polluters on a per capita basis due to heavy reliance on coal fired electricity labour wants half of australia s electricity generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030 and would offer rebates for households to buy solar batteries labor has also set a target to make electric cars account for half the new cars sold in australia by 2030 the liberals would spend 2 billion australian dollars 1 4 billion by 2030 on paying major polluters to reduce their emissions labour has also adopted aspects of the liberals scrapped national energy guarantee policy the program that placed on power generators a reliability obligation as well as emissions reduction obligation led to the overthrow of former prime minister malcolm turnbull by government colleagues who were opposed to any carbon reduction measures that increased the price of electricity ___ refugees the liberal led government has all but stopped asylum seekers from coming to australia by boats after 50 000 arrived on australian shores during labor s most recent six years in office the government has turned away 80 boats either sending them back to southeast asian ports or banishing the asylum seekers to immigration camps on the poor pacific island nations of papua new guinea and nauru labor takes some credit for that success noting the current policy of refusing to allow refugees who come by boat from ever settling in australia was adopted in the final weeks of a labor administration in 2013 but labor has committed to continue with the government s secretive military led operation sovereign borders the liberals say a labor government would encourage asylum seekers to come to australia by boat again by abolishing temporary protection visas the government only gives boat arrivals protection visas for three years they can be sent back to their homelands if the circumstances they fled from improve labour would give them permanent protection visas to provide certainty in their lives the liberals have capped australia s refugee intake at 18 750 while labor wants to lift the number to 27 000 the liberals also want to repeal a law passed by parliament by their opponents in february that reduces obstacles faced by asylum seekers seeking medical evacuations from papua new guinea and nauru ___ landlord tax breaks labour plans to reduce tax breaks for landlords which the liberals warn will accelerate a decline in house prices in major cities labour argues that property investors are squeezing first home buyers out of the housing market because the tax regime gives landlords an unfair advantage from next year landlords will only be able to claim tax deductions for losses from their property investments if the properties are new the aim is to encourage property investors to build new homes instead of competing for existing stock against people looking for a home the tax discount that landlords can claim from selling properties would be reduced from 50 to 25 the new rules will not apply to landlords who buy properties before jan 1 the liberals argue that the changes will reduce the value of all homes rod mcguirk the associated press
by stella qiu yawen chen and philip wen zhengzhou china reuters dressed in a smart black pantsuit behind the wheel of her pearl white audi zhao na has come a long way from her roots in rural henan province in central china the 29 year old real estate agent cheerfully admits to having shopaholic ways and a love of louis vuitton and prada handbags typifying a wave of free spending consumers who have had the world s top brands scrambling for a piece of china s 5 trillion plus retail market when i am flush i am happy to part with money said zhao who once splurged around 60 000 yuan 9 000 on a clutch of handbags during a trip to paris in 2017 spending makes me happy but with china s economy slowing zhao s business has hit a wall and her income has plummeted forcing her to shelve that source of happiness she has scrapped the european shopping trips and weaned herself off buying binges at her favorite mall david plaza where giant digital screens flash advertisements for brands like gucci lancome and ermenegildo zegna in the center of zhengzhou henan s capital not being able to spend money as i like makes me feel lousy but i cannot do much about it zhao said reality check an economic slowdown in china after three decades of unbridled growth is being felt especially keenly by consumers like zhao in henan the province with its 100 million people is a key pillar of china s aspirations to transform its economy by boosting domestic spending and raising living standards in the country s interior but according to dozens of interviews with consumers and merchants across henan as well as trade group data people in the province are spending less on everything from cars and household appliances to clothing and cosmetics map of henan province scaled back consumption by inland urbanites like zhao could have serious repercussions for china s economic growth already imperiled by an escalating trade war with the united states it could also be a reality check for global retailers the italian suit maker ermenegildo zegna the american luxury jeweler tiffany and apple nasdaq have all warned that consumers across china are paring back spending on wednesday china reported weak growth in retail sales and a drop in spending on clothing for the first time in a decade slowing spending in inland cities such as zhengzhou could dent the ambitions of global retailers that have pinned their hopes on future growth in regions like henan the largest provincial economy beyond china s prosperous coastal regions a province transformed long a dusty provincial capital zhengzhou s transformation in recent years into a metropolis with a glittering skyline and fashionable malls has been staggering the city of 10 million is a key transportation hub on china s belt and road network linked by rail to central asia and europe beyond with high speed connections to beijing and shanghai the taiwan contract manufacturer foxconn has built an enormous iphone factory in the city that employs 230 000 people ambitious young people once typically fled henan to seek better lives elsewhere but zhengzhou now gives them a place to pursue their middle class dreams earning more and being able to afford their own modern homes and an array of consumer goods for zhao the city was a beacon of hope born into a family of farmers in rural henan the youngest of three children zhao dreamed from an early age of escaping her impoverished village she did well in school which allowed her to attend university in zhengzhou where she discovered a talent for sales she joined a property developer working for rich clients sporting designer clothes and fancy handbags soon she was able to taste that lifestyle herself as she began racking up lucrative commissions on sales of top end apartments in zhengdong new area a commercial district where luxury hotels and office towers have sprouted from farmland she became a regular at the high end shops of david plaza and bought a car and two homes letting one of them out on airbnb supplementing the commissions zhao also piled up debt on her half dozen credit cards she says she owes about 200 000 yuan in credit card debt on top of monthly mortgage and car payments totaling 15 000 yuan but as zhengzhou s frenzied property market cooled last year sales plummeted along with her commissions and that put an end to her shopping trips to david plaza zhao is not alone in cutting back consumer confidence in provincial cities such as zhengzhou fell slightly last year after hitting its highest level in at least nine years in 2017 according to nielsen a research firm retail sales growth in zhengzhou fell to single digits last year for the first time in nearly two decades at two malls in zhengzhou s downtown shopping district retailers selling cosmetic brands like kiehl s and clinique said customers were becoming more careful they used to buy a lot and spend their money rather carelessly said li mengru the cosmetic sales manager at the dennis department store who oversees brands including chanel dior and estee lauder nyse now they are becoming choosier as they turn cautious about spending easy money a key driver of consumption in china in recent years has been the explosion of new finance options including peer to peer loans and endless opportunities for acquiring credit cards that put a wealth of consumer goods in reach for people previously unable to afford them chai maofeng a 28 year old beef distributor in xuchang a henan city of about 4 million people opened ten credit card accounts in 2016 to furnish his apartment with a sofa set refrigerator air conditioners and televisions all brand new opening a credit card account was easy banks were happy to lend to you and all you needed was a landline number that suggested you worked in an office said chai but chai said he had to put his freespending ways on hold after the economic slowdown started hurting his business which had also been hit by a sweeping crackdown on polluting industries that pushed up beef prices chai said he had put off plans to buy a second property and a new car this one from the company is actually fine he said referring to the white van his company lets him use worse to come china s economy showed signs of recovery in the first quarter with gross domestic product growing more than expected by analysts but an intensifying trade war with the united states sluggish factory activity and slowing global demand for chinese products suggest the slowdown will continue through 2019 most economists say efforts by beijing to rein in credit and risky debt over the past few years to contain speculative bubbles has also reduced the amount of easy money available for many consumers those factors are likely to keep weighing on consumer spending analysts say beijing has taken steps to prop up spending announcing plans in january for subsidies to boost purchases of cars an industry that saw sales decline last year for the first time in two decades the government has also sought to increase take home pay by reducing the income tax burden for many individuals graphic henan s skidding auto sales but government help is unlikely to offset a decline in confidence stemming from slowing income growth and rising household debt analysts say for all that consumers have not stopped spending altogether on a recent afternoon in downtown zhengzhou david plaza was bustling with shoppers checking out the latest lipsticks and sipping lattes in coffee shops but zhao was not among them staring at almost 30 years of mortgage payments ahead of her and the car loans she still needs to repay she said it might be a while before she shops at the mall again with income falling i have to make every penny count zhao said unnecessary luxury spending has to go for now
henry rotich the national treasury boss arrives back in the country this weekend after procuring a sh210 billion international loan that is slightly more expensive that the previous issues but even with the excitement generated by the latest eurobond the secured funds will likely to be a bitter yet critical pill in plugging the country s revenue shortfalls cs rotich took up just a fifth of what lenders offered in proceeds that would go a long way in reducing the government borrowing needs at home besides being used to repay some maturing debt the money will be pumped into crucial development projects that otherwise would have stalled for lack funding kenya s third eurobond issue is slightly more expensive than the previous two partly because of prevailing market conditions internationally where interest rates have relatively soared as well as the country having higher debt levels than it did the first time around convince lenders further it had been reported that mr rotich pictured hoped to convince lenders to allow kenya to repay the loan in two tranches in may 2029 and 2049 however the deal tabled was slightly different of the two tranches accepted kenya will pay an interest rate of seven per cent for the portion of the loan whose repayment will start in 2023 and eight per cent for the other half that matures starting 2028 these relatively shorter repayment terms mean more pressure for kenyans to service its debt obligations this comes on the heels of a recent warning issued by the international monetary fund which cautioned that at the pace of kenya s borrowing newer loans could only get costlier rotich s proposals would have bought the economy more time to organise its finances as soon as the money arrives at the central bank of kenya some sh75 billion 750 million plus a final interest of sh2 2 billion will be paid out to the lenders of the 2014 debut eurobond another portion of the money raised from borrowing from american and british lenders will be spent on development infrastructure projects which the treasury did not specify further apart from retiring the first portion of the 2014 eurobond the funds could potentially be used to repay other debt obligations the current eurobond which attracted offers nearly five times what rotich was seeking could be viewed as a major vote of confidence in the kenyan economy the announcement of kenya s issuance triggered an overwhelming response from investors that amounted to an order book of 9 5 billion sh950 billion an over subscription of 4 5 times the cs said following the conclusion of the issue interest on bonds is paid out every six months after borrowing meaning the lenders for this eurobond will start earning from november this year the lenders further want principal repayments of sh30 billion in 2023 2024 and 2025 and a further sh40 billion in 2028 2029 and 2030 rotich approached international lenders against the backdrop of a decision by the imf to withdraw a standby loan that was structured to cushion the local currency from shocks over failure to implement some measures including the removal of a cap on bank rates the imf facility was seen as an endorsement that would offer additional confidence to lenders that their money was safe but despite the sentiment internationally economists at home are concerned with the rate of accumulation of debt where a general consensus is that it is approaching unsustainable levels the country s total debt including what the state has borrowed at home reached sh5 4 trillion after the latest issue or nearly 62 per cent of the 2018 gross domestic product gdp while the amount in nominal terms could be argued to be below that of other countries some already under debt distress it is the ability of the economy to generate the required revenues in foreign currencies that is of concern billow kerrow an accountant and former mandera senator is among leaders who feel legislators and kenyans should at least be told what was contained in the prospectus mr kerrow noted that eurobond issues were international loans that required prior approval by parliament as per the constitution i can t remember any prospectus or proposal shared with parliament he told the standard kenya s current dollar reserves after the receipt of the bond will exceed sh1 trillion but the june eurobond repayment will take away sh77 billion in principal and interest already sh73 5 billion has been paid as interest on the first eurobond alone while another sh15 8 billion has been paid out on eurobond ii issued in february last year further in the next financial year kenya is scheduled to repay more than sh1 trillion in principal and interest which is more than 75 per cent of projected tax collection a huge chunk of the principal is however expected to be rolled over rotich has however not indicated what assurance he gave to lenders that their loans would be repaid details that are usually be contained in a document called a prospectus which is yet to made it is hoped that the cs would share the prospectus so as to offer kenyans a glimpse of the government s assurances to secure to loan secrecy relating to specific terms of borrowing for this eurobond pretty much like most of the sh2 9 trillion foreign loans to reduce to sh2 8 trillion next month has been a concern for many kenyans previous prospectuses were only made available long after the funds had been borrowed and after long persuasion

china usually gets its way in washington on wall street and in corporate boardrooms beijing has used the country s size and promise for decades to quell opposition and reward those who helped its rise those days may be coming to an end as it struggles with president trump s trade war a maturing and debt laden china is discovering that it no longer has the same pull members of both political parties in the united states favor a tougher stance against beijing some old business allies are standing on the sidelines or even cheering the trump administration s strong stands china could still prevail on the trade war s major issues but the conflict s length and severity reflect the growing perception that the country no longer holds the promise that once enthralled politicians and businesses in the united states many american companies with large profitable businesses in china do not want to pay expensive tariffs and worry that the united states is antagonizing the chinese public said ker gibbs the president of the american chamber of commerce in shanghai but many of the same businesses also chafe at the numerous restrictions that china has long maintained on foreign companies

outlook we get april leading economic indicators and the university of michigan preliminary may consumer confidence and inflation expectations these are not market triggers what is a market trigger is china saying no news talks are scheduled and seeming to suggest they won t be unless the us withdraws the plan to add tariffs to another 350 billion of imports the response in china was immediate the shanghai fell 2 48 all european bourses are in the red as of noon and us equity index futures point to a lower opening trump is stuck between two competing goals appearing macho and the only guy who can make a deal with china and having the stock market vote approval of him not his policies him there is only one solution a deal between xi and trump at g20 in osaka that s not until june 28 29 so we may suffer quite a lot before then ah but there is another way to get the stock market back on trump s side strong arm the fed into a cut or a promise of a cut the cme countdown to the upcoming fed meetings bears out this scenario for the june 19 meeting before g20 the probability of one cut is 13 3 from 10 0 a month ago for the july 31 meeting the probability of a cut is 27 0 from 1 3 3 a month ago for september 18 the probability is 41 1 from 23 4 a month ago the pce price index is up a mere 1 5 y y in march never mind that cpi is at 1 9 the fed looks at the pce it s not out the question that the fed would go along with a cut or at least talk of a cut the stock market is not the economy but never mind we are tired of analysts of the us china trade war and the current tension with iran saying the two sides misunderstand one another we say no the problems lies in trump never listening to the other side at all let alone with an open mind trump is a one word guy it s how he remembers his ruling principles china cheats must be punished and brought under the us thumb low interest rates are good and lowering them is even better iran threatens israel about that war with iran trump has said all along he wants to get out of expensive no win wars but it might be wrong to deduce he will avoid war with iran too that s because he has been verbally attacking iran all along too egged on by saudi arabia and israel analysts worry hawks will trick him into war but what if he had already made up his mind not that he can t be hoodwinked but if he has a mind made up this is not the usual impulsive blunder that doesn t mean it would be well done since trump doesn t read briefings and has no strategy unless bibi is whispering in his ear would war be good or bad for the incumbent in 2020 let s face it that s the primary target the draft dodger label didn t stick last time but might this time since the high lottery numbers story was proved a lie the lottery didn t begin until 18 months after trump got a 4f deferment for bone spurs attested to by a doctor friend and tenant of daddy it s the boys of the working and middle class that go to war not the rich kids with income inequality a bigger bone of contention for the fx market though war favors the dollar as the safe haven as we saw in 2003 we know trump wants a weaker dollar but that s probably not a reason to eschew war finally as a certified news junkie we are following the impeachment story very closely the house is reluctant until it has all its ducks lined up and the white house is doing all kinds of outrageous and unacceptable things to delay the house getting the information it needs to make a good case for impeachment like denying all subpoenas but the house will get the information in the end so it s a question of timing the tide of sentiment is turning for while it looked like the house would chicken out because the impeachment is judged in the senate and trump owns the senate body and soul but now the evidence is piling up that a case to the public will be powerful every day brings something new like yesterday s disclosure that the white house tried to intimidate a mueller witness former national security advisor flynn and there s a tape and it was a federal judge who ordered release of all the information previously redacted by the attorney general wow the attorney general mischaracterized the mueller report as exonerating trump when it did no such thing and in fact named at least 12 instances of impeachable offenses over 900 former federal prosecutors signed a letter opining that if the justice dept had not ruled a sitting president can t be indicted the report contains enough evidence to indict anyone else not so protected despite delays it seems likely the house will get all of trump s financial records including tax returns and winnow out whatever business deals he had with russia not to mention banking or insurance fraud still in the end it s the public that has to be convinced that took years in the nixon case impeaching a president tends to have little effect on financial markets when clinton was impeached the dollar barely burped and clinton s popularity in the polls remained steady at over 60 throughout however this time we could see an actual effect if impeachment shoves trump off a cliff into dangerous waters whereupon he will say he is the only guy who can save us from the crisis he created but as noted before geopolitical crises tend to favor the dollar even when the party causing the crisis is the us this is motivation for a different reserve currency to be sure but one is not being developed look at the tidy waves on the euro dollar chart over the last six months try to imagine what could deliver a breakout either way if a rate cut is more than offset with worries about china and iran the dollar remains the safe haven tidbit from the euronews newsletter austrian mps voted to pass a law banning headscarves in primary schools or rather all head covering clothes of ideological or religious influence sikh turbans and jewish yarmulke are exempt meaning only females are targeted the law originates from the far right coalition the opposition voted as one against it the government has said it expects the law to face legal challenges as islamic religious organisations plan to dispute the law in constitutional court the european court of justice already allows countries to ban full face veils but even in france muslim women can wear headscarves this is the latest in a long line of anti muslim actions and attempts at suppression all over europe we don t know what it means except that when legislators are busy on social issues they are not busy on fiscal matters tidbit 2 bloomberg reports a german company named lilium has invented an all electric vertical takeoff passenger jet the company plans a fleet of 5 seaters that can fly with or without a pilot worldwide by 2025 it would be emission free five times faster than a car and produce less noise than a motorbike we don t think of germany as a hotbed of innovation and the neuer markt crashing without a ripple two decades ago but this is impressive maybe

australian shores during labor s most recent six years in office ap photo file canberra australia ap the policy differences between the two major political parties vying for power at australian elections on saturday have been described as the widest divide at a federal contest in 26 years the center left opposition labor party is regarded as pursuing a big target strategy with a diverse range of policies aimed at creating a more equitable society under the slogan a fair go for australia to give someone a fair go is an australian colloquialism for providing justice the conservative liberal party led coalition government is promising a steady course in uncertain times under the banner building our economy securing your future the government warns voters that australia s slowing economy would be damaged by labor s ambitious agenda here are some of the policy differences ___ china the liberal and labor parties have promised different approaches toward australia s most important trading partner china after relations have strained in recent years over issues including australia s ban on covert foreign interference in domestic politics and foreign political donations but both parties have been short on specifics the liberal led coalition government has upset beijing by blocking chinese companies from buying a cattle empire and sydney electricity provider and by banning chinese technology giant huawei from australia s 5g telecommunications network rollout this year advertisement advertisement former labor prime minister paul keating last week angered the government by describing australian intelligence agency bosses as nutters who had damaged relations with china by warning against chinese investments in sensitive australian infrastructure labor leader bill shorten has distanced himself from keating s comments but shorten suggested australia needed to rebalance it relationship with china warning against viewing china s rise solely through the prism of strategic risk labor accused prime minister scott morrison of offending chinese this week when he described them as australia s customers while the united states were australia s friends

s greenhouse gas emissions by 45 below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve zero emissions by 2050 the coalition government has committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 by 2030 and warns that labor s more ambitious target would wreck the economy the liberals are critical of labor s failure to put a monetary cost on the target labor argues that failure to act on climate change would also cost the economy advertisement advertisement energy policy is a contentious issue in a country that s the world biggest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas australia has been one of the world s worst carbon polluters on a per capita basis due to heavy reliance on coal fired electricity labor wants half of australia s electricity generated by renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2030 and would offer rebates for households to buy solar batteries labor has also set a target to make electric cars account for half the new cars sold in australia by 2030 the liberals would spend 2 billion australian dollars 1 4 billion by 2030 on paying major polluters to reduce their emissions labor has also adopted aspects of the liberals scrapped national energy guarantee policy the program that placed on power generators a reliability obligation as well as emissions reduction obligation led to the overthrow of former prime minister malcolm turnbull by government colleagues who were opposed to any carbon reduction measures that increased the price of electricity advertisement advertisement ___ refugees the liberal led government has all but stopped asylum seekers from coming to australia by boats after 50 000 arrived on australian shores during labor s most recent six years in office the government has turned away 80 boats either sending them back to southeast asian ports or banishing the asylum seekers to immigration camps on the poor pacific island nations of papua new guinea and nauru labor takes some credit for that success noting the current policy of refusing to allow refugees who come by boat from ever settling in australia was adopted in the final weeks of a labor administration in 2013 advertisement advertisement but labor has committed to continue with the government s secretive military led operation sovereign borders the liberals say a labor government would encourage asylum seekers to come to australia by boat again by abolishing temporary protection visas the government only gives boat arrivals protection visas for three years they can be sent back to their homelands if the circumstances they fled from improve labor would give them permanent protection visas to provide certainty in their lives the liberals have capped australia s refugee intake at 18 750 while labor wants to lift the number to 27 000 advertisement advertisement the liberals also want to repeal a law passed by parliament by their opponents in february that reduces obstacles faced by asylum seekers seeking medical evacuations from papua new guinea and nauru ___ landlord tax breaks labor plans to reduce tax breaks for landlords which the liberals warn will accelerate a decline in house prices in major cities labor argues that property investors are squeezing first home buyers out of the housing market because the tax regime gives landlords an unfair advantage from next year landlords will only be able to claim tax deductions for losses from their property investments if the properties are new the aim is to encourage property investors to build new homes instead of competing for existing stock against people looking for a home advertisement advertisement the tax discount that landlords can claim from selling properties would be reduced from 50 to 25 the new rules will not apply to landlords who buy properties before jan 1 the liberals argue that the changes will reduce the value of all homes

states is fast approaching the debt levels of countries that have gone bankrupt and the first step in getting our debt under control is fixing the budget process conrad s written testimony and opening statement recounted his experience on the budget committee reflecting on the ability to work across the aisle in a bipartisan way he also cautioned against ignoring the growing national debt pointing to other countries throughout history that have ignored debt to their own peril he recommended a series of reforms with the central idea that any senator should be able to bring a budget to the floor if leadership fails to bring a committee reported budget to the floor after making their opening statements the former chairs answered questions from committee members enzi asked about their experiences with the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform simpson bowles gregg and conrad highlighted the commission s truly bipartisan nature and how all involved shared the common goal of putting the nation on a sustainable long term fiscal path while the commission put forward a solid proposal that would have stabilized the national debt the former chairs cited a lack of will by congressional leadership as the ultimate reason why its recommendations were not enacted van hollen expressed reservations that a renewed effort to fix the federal budget process would succeed where simpson bowles had failed he cited the 2015 repeal of the conrad rule which prohibited budget reconciliation legislation from increasing deficits to illustrate how congress often ignores or even violates its own budget rules conrad who created and championed the rule during his tenure as chair of the senate budget committee shared van hollen s skepticism that small scale changes or tweaks like the conrad rule would be sufficient to fix the budget process at this point he and gregg said they expect that wholesale changes to the budget process and significant policy reforms will likely not occur until they are forced by an impending fiscal crisis van hollen shared conrad s frustration but hoped that someone could come up with a workable solution before a crisis occurs senator david perdue r ga recounted the bipartisan progress made on the joint select committee on budget and appropriations process reform he then asked the witnesses to describe potential enforcement mechanisms that could generate the political will needed to pass a budget each year conrad reiterated his recommendation that any senator be allowed to bring a budget resolution to the floor while gregg recommended thinking outside the box and suggested establishing relatively severe cuts to spending and increases to revenues that would happen automatically if congress did not pass a budget senator tim kaine d va drew on his experiences as mayor of richmond and governor of virginia noting how the virginia general assembly sets long term targets for debt and interest payments as percentages of gross domestic product gdp and outlays respectively he asked whether a similar debt to gdp target could work for the federal government conrad and gregg said that not only is such a target desirable it is absolutely essential for a responsible approach to the federal budget they also noted that a federal debt to gdp target was one of the proposals put forward by the simpson bowles commission senator mike braun r in expressed concern that increasing taxes to get the budget to balance might slow economic growth he also worried about declining faith in the u s dollar as the world s reserve currency noting that a shift to relying on another country s currency could be harmful to the u s economy conrad responded by emphasizing the necessity of a balanced approach to deficit reduction that carefully combines spending cuts and revenue increases citing the balanced budgets achieved under the clinton administration as proof that such a plan could be politically viable gregg again pointed to the simpson bowles commission in particular the tax proposals that were modeled on the revenue neutral 1986 tax reform as an example of pro growth reform enzi concluded the questions by asking about the proper role of the executive branch in the budget process and the witnesses had different opinions while gregg thought that getting the president involved earlier would better facilitate smooth and timely budgeting and appropriations conrad expressed substantial reservations about congress ceding any more authority to the president than it already has enzi observed that the office of management and budget the senate budget committee the senate appropriations committee and the treasury all use completely different formats for the budget which he thinks is intentional so no one can follow the money his final question about the virtues and viability of a biennial budget process received support from both former chairs in his closing remarks enzi observed that the senate budget committee and the senate appropriations committee may be misnamed considering the appropriations committee s dominance over the budget process he mused that the appropriations committee should take on the budget resolution thereby becoming the budget and appropriations committee as for the budget committee he suggested that it be transformed into the debt control committee and tasked with long term deficit reduction finally enzi expressed optimism that this is a good time to pursue budget process reforms since neither party knows who will control the congress or the white house after the upcoming presidential and congressional elections for more information on possible budget process reforms see crfb s better budget process initiative crfb s budget process reform options crfb s

budget resolution to the floor for immediate consideration if the budget committee passes a budget resolution but does not bring it to the floor within ten days congressional leadership knows that if the budget committee takes action on a budget resolution even if the budget never goes to the floor for a vote it blocks any member from offering a resolution that would require consideration of the
