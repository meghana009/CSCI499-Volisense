by imperialism is getting something for nothing it is a strategy to obtain other countries surplus without playing a productive role but by creating an extractive rentier system an imperialist power obliges other countries to pay tribute of course america doesn t come right out and tell other countries you have to pay us tribute like roman emperors told the provinces they governed u s diplomats simply insist that other countries invest their balance of payments inflows and official central bank savings in us dollars especially u s treasury ious this treasury bill standard turns the global monetary and financial system into a tributary system that is what pays the costs of u s military spending including its 800 military bases throughout the world i m bonnie faulkner today on guns and butter dr michael hudson today s show de dollarizing the american financial empire dr hudson is a financial economist and historian he is president of the institute for the study of long term economic trend a wall street financial analyst and distinguished research professor of economics at the university of missouri kansas city his most recent books include and forgive them their debts lending foreclosure and redemption from bronze age finance to the jubilee year killing the host how financial parasites and debt destroy the global economy and j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception he is also author of trade development and foreign debt among many other books we return today to a discussion of dr hudson s seminal 1972 book super imperialism the economic strategy of american empire a critique of how the united states exploited foreign economies through the imf and world bank we discuss how the united states has dominated the world economically both as the world s largest creditor and then later as the world s largest debtor and take a look at the coming demise of dollar domination bonnie faulkner michael hudson welcome back michael hudson it s good to be back bonnie bonnie faulkner why is president trump insisting that the federal reserve lower interest rates i thought they were already extremely low and if they did go lower what effect would this have michael hudson interest rates are historically low and they have been kept low in order to try to keep providing cheap money for speculators to buy stocks and bonds to make arbitrage gains speculators can borrow at a low rate of interest to buy a stock yielding dividends and also making capital gains at a higher rate of return or by buying a bond such as corporate junk bonds that pay higher interest rates and keep the difference in short low interest rates are a form of financial engineering trump wants interest rates to be low in order to inflate the housing market and the stock market even more as if that is an index of the real economy not just the financial sector that is wrapped around the economy of production and consumption beyond this domestic concern trump imagines that if you keep interest rates lower than those of europe the dollar s exchange rate will decline he thinks that this will make u s exports more competitive with foreign products trump is criticizing the federal reserve for not keeping interest rates even lower than those of europe he he thinks that if interest rates are low there will be an outflow of capital from this country to buy foreign stocks and bonds that pay a higher interest rate this financial outflow will lower the dollar s exchange rate he believes that this will increase the chance of rebuilding america s manufacturing exports this is the great neoliberal miscalculation it also is the basis for imf models how low interest rates lower the dollar s exchange rate raising import prices trump s guiding idea is that lowering the dollar s value will lower the cost of labor to employers that s what happens when a currency is devalued depreciation doesn t lower costs that have a common worldwide price there s a common price for oil in the world a common price of raw materials and pretty much a common price for capital and credit so the main thing that s devalued when you push a currency down is the price of labor and its working conditions workers are squeezed when a currency s exchange rate falls because they have to pay more for goods they import if the dollar goes down against the chinese yen or european currency chinese imports are going to cost more in dollars so will european imports that is the logic behind beggar my neighbor devaluations how much more foreign imports will cost depends on how far the dollar goes down but even if it plunges by 50 percent even if the dollar were to become a junk currency like the argentinian or other latin american currencies that cannot really increase american manufacturing exports because not much american labor works in factories anymore workers drive cabs and work in the service industry or for medical insurance companies even if you give american workers in manufacturing companies all their clothing and food for nothing they still can t compete with foreign countries because their housing costs are so high their medical insurance is so high and their taxes are so high that they re priced out of world markets so it won t help much if the dollar goes down by 1 percent 10 percent or even 20 percent if you don t have factories going and if you don t have a transportation system a power supply and if our public utilities and infrastructure are being run down there s nothing that currency manipulation can do to enable america to quickly rebuild its manufacturing export industries american parent companies have already moved their factories abroad they have given up on america as long as trump or his successors refrain from changing that system as long as he gives tax advantages for companies to move abroad there s nothing he can do that will restore industry here but he s picked up international monetary fund s junk economics the neoliberal patter talk that it s given to latin america pretending that if a country just lowers its exchange rate more it will be able to lower its wages and living standards paying labor less in hard currency terms until at some point when its poverty and austerity get deep enough it will become more competitive that hasn t worked for fifty years in latin america it hasn t worked for other countries either and it never worked in the united states the 19th century american school of political economy developed the economy of high wages doctrine i review this in my book on america s protectionist takeoff 1815 1914 they recognized that if you pay labor more it s more productive it can afford a better education and it works better that s why high wage labor can undersell low wage pauper labor trump is therefore a century behind the times in picking up the imf austerity idea that you can just devalue the currency and reduce labor s wages and living standards in international terms to make the economy more profitable and somehow work your way out of debt what currency depreciation does do when the dollar is devalued is to enable wall street firms to borrow 1 and to buy european currencies and bonds yielding 3 percent or 4 percent or 5 percent or stocks yielding even more the guiding idea is to do what japan did in 1990 have very low interest rates to increase what s called the carry trade the carry trade is borrowing at a low interest rate and buying bonds yielding a higher rate making an arbitrage gain on the interest rate differential so trump is creating an arbitrage opportunity for wall street investors he pretends that this is pro labor and can rebuild manufacturing but it only helps hollow out the u s economy sending money to other countries to build them up instead of investing in ourselves so the effect of what trump s doing is the opposite of what he says he s doing bonnie faulkner exactly what is the point of driving investment into foreign countries away from the united states michael hudson if you re an investor you can make more money by dismantling the u s economy you can borrow at 1 percent and buy a bond or a stock that yields 3 or 4 percent that s called arbitrage it s a financial free lunch the effect of this free lunch as you say is to build up foreign economies or at least their financial markets while undercutting your own finance is cosmopolitan not patriotic it doesn t really care where it makes money finance goes wherever the rate of return is highest that s the dynamic that has been de industrializing the united states over the past forty years bonnie faulkner from what you re saying it sounds like donald trump s policies are leading to doing to the united states what the imf and world bank have traditionally done to foreign economies michael hudson that s what happens when you devalue the financial sector will see that interest rates are going down so the dollar s exchange rate also will decline investors will move their money or will borrow into euros gold or japanese yen or swiss francs whose exchange rate is expected to rise so you re offering a financial arbitrage and capital gain for investors who speculate in foreign currencies you re also hollowing out the economy here and squeezing real wage levels and living standards why devaluation will not help re industrialize the u s economy bonnie faulkner do you think that donald trump understands what he s doing michael hudson i don t think he understands i think he has an oversimplified view of how the world works he thinks that if we devalue the dollar we can undersell china and europe but you can only undersell them if you have car making factories available if you don t have a factory you re not going to be able to undersell foreign carmakers no matter how low the dollar goes and if you don t have a set of computer manufacturing factories and local suppliers already in the united states you re not going to have production capacity able to undersell china most of all you need public infrastructure and affordable housing education and health care so trump s view is a fantasy it s like saying if we had some ham we could have some ham and eggs if we had some eggs it leaves the causes of america s de industrialization out of account if we had unemployed car makers computer makers and other manufacturers here factories that were idle in an economy that was pretty competitive then devaluation might make some sense but americans are not just a bit uncompetitive the housing costs in america are so high the medical and health insurance costs the taxes and wage withholding on labor and prices for basic infrastructure that there s no way that we can compete with foreign countries simply by currency manipulation since 1980 the u s economy has been made very high cost yet there also has been a huge squeeze on labor by raising the prices it has to pay for basic needs even if wages go up people can t afford to live as well as they did thirty years ago a radical restructuring is needed in order to restore a full employment industrial economy you need de privatization you have to break up monopolies you need the kind of economy and economic reform that america had under franklin roosevelt in the 1930s i don t see that happening bonnie faulkner do you think that donald trump was installed as u s president to oversee the bankruptcy of the united states and dismantling the u s empire michael hudson nobody installed him he installed himself i don t think most people expected him to win if you look at the odds that professional bookies and oddsmakers gave from the time he announced his candidacy most people thought that sleepy jeb bush would get the nomination and that bush then would lose to hillary so there were indeed attempts an attempt to install hillary or bush but nobody tried to install trump he made an end run around them by straight talk humor and celebrityhood he didn t have advisors that he would listen to because he s always been a one man show and he doesn t really know what he s doing economically he knows how to cheat people victimize suppliers and how to make money in real estate simply by not paying suppliers and by borrowing from banks and not paying them but he has no idea that you can t run an economy this way being a real estate mafioso isn t the same thing as running a whole economy trump has no idea and i don t think anyone knows how to control him except maybe fox news wall street vs the real economy which turns out to be more real bonnie faulkner what is going on with the ruling class in the united states does anybody in its ranks know how to run an economy michael hudson the problem is that running an economy to help the people and raise living standards and even to lower the cost of living and doing business means not running it to help wall street if someone knows how to run an economy the financial sector wants to keep them out of any public office high finance is short term not long term it plays the hit and run game not the much harder task of creating a framework for tangible economic growth you can do one of two things you can help labor or you can help wall street if running the economy means helping labor and improving living standards by giving better medical care this is going to be at the expense of the financial sector and short term corporate profits so the last thing you want to do is have somebody run the economy for its own prosperity instead of for wall street s purpose at issue is who s going to do the planning will it be elected public officials in the government or wall street wall street s public relations office is the university of chicago it claims that a free market is one where rich wall street investors and the financial class run an economy but if you let people vote and democratically elect governments to regulate that s called interference in a free market this is the fight that trump has against china he wants to tell it to let the banks run china and have a free market he says that china has grown rich over the last fifty years by unfair means with government help and public enterprise in effect he wants chinese to be as threatened and insecure as american workers they should get rid of their public transportation they should get rid of their subsidies they should let a lot of their companies go bankrupt so that americans can buy them they should have the same kind of free market that has wrecked the us economy china doesn t want that kind of a free market of course it does have a market economy it is actually much like the united states was in its 19th century industrial takeoff with strong government subsidy u s changing monetary strategy from payments surplus to deficit status bonnie faulkner in your seminal work from 1972 super imperialism the economic strategy of american empire you write whereas us domination of the world economy stemmed from 1920 through 1960 from its creditor position its control since the 1960s has stemmed from is debtor position not only have the tables been turned but us diplomats have found that their leverage as the world s major debtor economy is fully as strong as that which formerly had reflected its net creditor position this sounds counter intuitive could you break it down let s start with 1920 through 1960 how was the united states able to dominate the world economy from its creditor position michael hudson the u s creditor position really began after world war i based on the money it lent to the allies before it joined the war when the war ended u s diplomats told england and france to pay us for the arms they had bought early on but in the past for centuries the victors usually forgave all the debts among each other once a war was over for the first time america insisted that the allies pay for the military support it had sold them before joining them the european allies were pretty devastated by the war and they turned to germany and insisted on reparations that quickly bankrupted germany german bankrupted its economy trying to pay england and france which simply sent it on to pay the united states their balance of payments was in deficit and their currencies were going down american investors saw an opportunity to buy up their industry gold was the measure of power the backing for domestic money and credit and hence capital investment america was much more productive not having suffered war damage here between the end of world war ii and 1950 when the korean war broke out america accumulated over 75 percent of the world s monetary gold the united states had heavy agricultural exports growing industrial exports and enough money to buy up the leading industries of europe and latin america and other countries but beginning in 1950 with the korean war the u s balance of payments moved into deficit for the first time it got even worse when president eisenhower decided that america had to support french colonialism in southeast asia in french indochina vietnam and laos by the time the vietnam war escalated in the 1960s the dollar was running large balance of payments deficits every week on wall street we would watch the gold supply go down losing gold to countries that weren t at war like france and germany they were cashing in the excess dollars that were being spent by the u s military by the 1960s it became clear that america was on a trajectory to run out of gold within a decade because of this overseas war spending it finally did by august 1971when president nixon stopped selling bold on the london exchange and the price was allowed to soar far above 35 an ounce the u s balance of payments was still running a deep deficit because of the fighting in southeast asia and elsewhere creating a permanent balance of payments deficit the private sector was just in balance during the 1950s and 1960s the entire deficit was military when america went off gold people began to wonder what was going to happen many predicted an economic doomsday it was losing its ability to rule the world through gold but what i realized and was the first to publish was that if countries no longer could buy and hold gold in their international reserves what were they going to hold there was only one asset that they could hold u s government securities that is treasury bonds a treasury bond is a loan to the us treasury when a foreign central bank buys a bond it finances the domestic u s budget deficit so the balance of payments deficit ends up financing the domestic budget deficit the result is a circular flow of military spending recycled by foreign central banks after 1971 the united states continued to spend abroad militarily and in 1974 the opec countries quadrupled the price of oil at that time the united states told saudi arabia that it could charge whatever it wanted for its oil but it had to recycle all its net dollar earnings the saudis were not to buy gold the saudis were told that it would be an act of war if they didn t recycle into the american economy the dollars they received for their oil exports they were encouraged to buy u s treasury bonds but could also buy other u s bonds and stocks to help push up the stock and bond markets here while supporting the dollar the united states kept its own gold stock while wanting the rest of the world to hold its savings in the form of loans to the united states so the dollar didn t go down other countries that were receiving dollars simply recycled them to buy u s financial securities what would have happened if they wouldn t have done this let s say you re germany france or japan if you don t recycle your dollar receipts back to the u s economy your currency is going to go up dollar inflows from export sales are being converted into your currency increasing its exchange rate but by buying u s bonds or stocks bid the price of dollars back up against your own currency so when the united states runs a balance of payments deficit under conditions where other countries keep their foreign reserves in dollars the effect is for other countries to keep their currencies exchange rates stable mainly by lending to the u s government that gives the united states a free ride it can encircle the world with military bases and the dollars that this costs are returned to the united states imagine writing ious when you go out to spend at a store or restaurant but your ious are never going to be collected the store might say we have an iou from bonnie faulkner let s keep it as our savings instead of putting it in the bank or asking for payment in real money we re just going to keep collecting these ious from bonnie faulkner corporations call such ious and trade credit receivables now suppose you went on a spending spree and gave the store a billion dollars worth of your ious there s no way that you could pay off this billion dollars in that case the stores receiving these ious would say well we really don t want to foreclose on bonnie because we know that she can t pay we d lose the value of receivables on the asset side of our balance sheet all these ious that we ve been collecting that s essentially what foreign countries are saying about their buildup of dollars the u s position is in effect that we are not going to repay any foreign country the dollar debt we owe them as treasury secretary john connolly said it s our dollars but your problem other countries have to pay us or else we ll bomb them the military dimension to this arrangement is the u s position that it would be an act of war if other countries don t keep spending their export earnings on loans or u s stocks and bonds that s what makes the united states the exceptional country the value of our currency is based on other countries savings the money they save has to be held in the form of dollars or securities that we re never going to repay even if we could this is a huge free ride you d think that donald trump would want to keep it going but he claims that china is manipulating its currency by recycling its dollars into loans to the u s treasury what does he mean by that china is earning a lot of dollars by exports its goods to the united states what does it do with these dollars it tried to do what america did with europe and south america it tried to buy american companies but the united states blocked it from doing this on specious national security grounds the government claims that our national security would be threatened if china would buy a chain of filling stations as it wanted to do in california the united states thus has a double standard claiming that it is threatened if china buys any company but insisting on its right to buy out the commanding heights of foreign economies with its electronic dollar credit that leaves china with only one option it can buy u s treasury bonds lending its export earnings to the u s treasury trump is now driving other countries out of the dollar orbit china now realizes that the u s treasury isn t going to repay even if it wanted to recycle its export earnings into treasury bonds or u s stocks and bonds or real estate donald trump now is saying that he doesn t want china to support the dollar s exchange rate and keep its own exchange rate down by buying u s assets we re telling china not to do what we ve told other countries to do for the past forty years to buy u s securities trump accuses countries of artificial currency manipulation if they keep their foreign reserves in dollars so he s telling them and specifically china to get rid of their dollar holdings not to buy dollars with their export earnings anymore so china is buying gold russia also is buying gold and much of the world is now in the process of reverting to the gold exchange standard meaning that gold is used to settle international payments imbalances but is not connected to domestic money creation countries realize that there s a great advantage of the gold exchange standard there s only a limited amount of gold in the world s central banks this means that any country that wages war is going to run such a large balance of payments deficit that it s going to lose its gold reserves so reviving the role of gold may prevent any country including the united states from going to war and suffering a military deficit the irony is that trump is breaking up america s financial free ride its policy of monetary imperialism by telling counties to stop recycling their dollar inflows they ve got to de dollarize their economies the effect is to make these economies independent of the united states trump already has announced that we won t hire chinese in our it sectors or let chinese study subjects at university that might enable them to rival us so our economies are going to separate in effect trump has said that if we can t win in a trade deal if we can t make other countries lose and become more dependent on u s suppliers and monopoly pricing then we re not going to sign an agreement this stance is driving not only china but russia and even europe and other countries all out of the u s orbit the end result is going to be that the united states is going to be isolated without being able to manufacture like it used to do it s dismantled its manufacturing so how will it get by some population figures were released a week ago showing the middle of america is emptying out the population is moving from the midwestern and mountain states to the east and the west coasts and the gulf coast so trump s policies are accelerating the de industrialization of the united states without doing anything to put new productive powers in place and not even wanting other countries to invest here the german car companies see trump putting tariffs on the imported steel they need to build cars in the united states it built them here to get around america s tariff barriers against german and other automobiles but now trump is not even letting them import the parts that they need to assemble these cars in the non unionized plants they ve built in the south what can they do perhaps they ll propose a trade with general motors and chrysler the europeans will get the factories that american companies own in europe and give them their american factories in exchange this kind of split is occurring without any attempt to make american labor more competitive by lowering its cost of housing or the price of its health insurance and medical care or its transportation costs or the infrastructure costs so america is being left high and dry as a high priced economy in a nationalistic world while running a huge balance of payments deficit to support its military spending all over the globe bonnie faulkner so it sounds like when the united states went off the gold standard the dollar basically replaced gold as the main asset in which foreign governments could hold their assets now you re saying that when there was no more gold standard if foreign economies didn t buy u s treasuries the price of their currency would rise and make them uncompetitive michael hudson yes imagine if americans would have to pay more and more dollars to buy german cars there s going to be a larger demand for german currency the euro whose exchange rate would rise that was happening throughout the 1960s and 1970s before the euro the only way that germany could keep down the value of its mark was to buy something that cost dollars it didn t buy american exports because america already was making and exporting less and less except for food and germany can only eat so much wheat and soybeans so the only thing that germany could buy that was priced in dollars were u s treasury bonds that kept the german mark from rising even more rapidly and kept the balance of payments in balance japan had a similar problem the japanese tried to buy u s real estate but they didn t have any idea of what made real estate valuable here they lost a reported billion dollars on buying rockefeller center not realizing that the building was separate from the land value and the land was owned by columbia university the building itself was running at a deficit most of the rental value paid was to the owner of the land s groundrent the japanese had no idea of how american real estate worked the euro is only a satellite currency of the u s dollar some americans worried that the euro might become a rival to the dollar after all europe is not de industrializing it is moving forward and producing better cars airplanes and other exports so the united states persuaded foreign politicians to cripple the euro by making it an austerity currency creating so few government bonds that there s no euro vehicle large enough for foreign countries to keep their foreign reserves in the united states can create more and more dollar debt by running a budget deficit we can follow keynesian policies by running a deficit to employ more labor but the eurozone refuses to let countries run a budget deficit of more than 3 percent of its gdp now running more than 3 percent of their gdp that level is very marginal compared to the united states and if you re trying not to run any deficit at all and even if you keep it less than 3 then you re imposing austerity on your country keeping your employment down you re stifling your internal market cutting your throat by being unable to create a real rival to the dollar that s why donald rumsfeld called europe a dead zone and why the only alternatives for a rival currency are the chinese yuan they re moving into a gold based currency area along with russia iran and other members of the shanghai cooperation organization bonnie faulkner the european union not allowing european countries within the eurozone to not run deficits more than 3 percent was basically cutting their own throat why would they do such a thing michael hudson because the heads of the central bank are fighting a class war they look at themselves as financial generals in the economic fight against labor to hurt the working class lower wages and help their political constituency the wealthy investing class europe always has had a more vicious class war than the united states does it s never really emerged from its aristocratic post feudal system its central bankers and universities follow the university of chicago free market school saying that the way to get rich is to make your labor poorer and to create a government where labor doesn t have a voice that s europe s economic philosophy and it s why europe has not matched the growth that china and other countries are experiencing bonnie faulkner so it sounds like then the united states has been able to dominate the world economy since 1971 from a debtor position michael hudson when it was losing gold from 1950 to 1971 that wasn t dominating that was losing america s gold supply to france germany japan and other countries only when it stopped the gold exchange standard and left countries with no alternative for their international savings but to buy u s treasury bonds or other securities was it able to pay for its military spending without losing its power since 1971 world diplomacy has essentially been backed by american military power it s not a free market military power keeps countries in a financial strait jacket in which the united states can run into debt without having to repay it other countries that run payments deficits are not allowed to expand their economies either to rival the united states or even to improve living standards for their labor force only countries outside the u s orbit china and in principle russia and some other countries in asia are able to increase their living standards and capital investment and technology by being free of this globalized financial class war bonnie faulkner in super imperialism you write that pressures to create a new international economic order collapsed by the end of the 1970s are you saying that other countries simply gave up and acquiesced to american monetary imperialism what happened michael hudson i m told that there was wholesale bribery officials in the reagan administration told me that they just paid off foreign officials to support the u s position not a new international economic order u s agencies maneuvered within the party politics of european and near eastern countries to promote pro american officials and sideline those who did not agree to act as u s satellites a lot of money was involved in this meddling so the united stateshas corrupted democratic politics throughout europe and the near east and much of asia that has succeeded in sterilizing foreign independence in the united states meanwhile thatcher s and reagan s neoliberal ideas were promoted instead of the kind of mixed economy that roosevelt and social democracy had been pressing for fifty years who will plan economies financial managers or democratic governments bonnie faulkner if there were pressures to create a new international economic order in the 1970s what was this new order looking to achieve michael hudson other countries wanted to do for their economies what the united states has long done for its own economy to use their governments deficit spending to build up their infrastructure raise living standards create housing and promote progressive taxation that would prevent a rentier class a landlord and financial class from taking over economic management in the financial field they wanted governments to create their own money to promote their own development just like the united states does the role of neoliberalism was the opposite it was to promote the financial and real estate sector and monopolies to take economic management away from government so the real question from the 1980s on was about who would be the basic planning center of society would it be the financial sector the banks and bondholders whose interest is really the one percent that own most of the banks bonds and stocks or is it going to be governments trying to subsidize the economy to help the 99 percent grow and prosper that was the social democratic view opposed by thatcherism and reaganism the international drive to de dollarize bonnie faulkner was this pressure that blocked a new international economic order brought on by the united states going off the gold exchange standard michael hudson no it was a reaction against the u s policy of siphoning off the commanding heights of foreign economies the united states wants to control their raw materials exports especially their oil and gas it wants to control their financial system so that all of their economic gains will go to foreign investors mainly u s investors it wants to turn other economies into service economies to the united states and to make them into a kind of super nato military alliance that will oppose any country that does not want to be part of the u s centered unilateral global order bonnie faulkner how does today s monetary imperialism super imperialism differ from the imperialism of the past michael hudson it s a higher stage of imperialism the old imperialism was colonialism you would come in and use military power to install a client ruling class but each country would have its own currency what has made imperialism super is that america doesn t have to colonize another country it doesn t have to invade a country or actually go to war with it all it needs is to have the country invest its savings its export earnings in loans to the united states government this enables the united states to keep its interest rates low and enable american investors to borrow from american banks at a low rate to buy up foreign industry and agriculture that s yielding 10 percent 15 percent or more so american investors realize that despite the balance of payments deficit they can borrow back these dollars at such a low rate from foreign countries paying only 1 percent to 3 percent on the treasury bonds they hold while pumping dollars into foreign economies by buying up their industry and agriculture and infrastructure and public utilities making large capital gains the hope is that and soon we ll earn our way out of debt by this free ride arrangement imperialism is getting something for nothing it is a strategy to obtain other countries surplus without playing a productive role but by creating an extractive rentier system an imperialist power obliges other countries to pay tribute of course america doesn t come right out and tell other countries you have to pay us tribute like roman emperors told the provinces they governed u s diplomats simply insist that other countries invest their balance of payments inflows and official central bank savings in us dollars especially u s treasury ious this treasury bill standard turns the global monetary and financial system into a tributary system that is what pays the costs of u s military spending including its 800 military bases throughout the world and its foreign legion of isis al qaeda fighters and color revolutions to destabilize countries that don t adhere to the dollar centered global economic system bonnie faulkner you write today it would be necessary for europe and asia to design an artificial politically created alternative to the dollar as an international store of value this promises to become the crux of international political tensions for the next generation how does the world break out of this double standard dollar domination michael hudson it s already coming about and trump is a great catalyst speeding departing guests china and russia are reducing their dollar holdings they don t want to hold american treasury bonds because if america goes to war with them it will do to them what it did to iran it will just keep all the money not pay back the investment china has kept in u s banks and the treasury so they re getting rid of the dollars that they hold they re buying gold and are moving as quickly as they can to be independent of any reliance on u s exports they are building up their military so that if the united states tries to threaten them they can defend themselves the world is fracturing bonnie faulkner what are foreign countries like china and russia using to buy gold are they buying it with dollars michael hudson yes they earn dollars or euros from what they re exporting this money goes into the central bank of china because chinese exporters want domestic yuan to pay their own workers and suppliers so they go to the bank of china and they exchange their dollars for yuan the bank of china the central bank then decides what to do with this foreign currency they may go into the open market and buy gold or they may spend it in foreign countries on the belt and road initiative to build a railway and steamship infrastructure and port development to help china s exporters integrate their economy with others and ultimately with europe replacing the united states as customer and supplier they see the united states as a dying economy bonnie faulkner can the chinese build up their belt and road infrastructure projects with dollars michael hudson no they are getting rid of dollars they already are receiving such a large surplus each year that they only use the dollars to buy gold or some goods such as boeing airplanes but mostly food and raw materials when china buys iron from australia for instance they sell dollars from their foreign exchange reserves and buy australian currency to pay australians for the iron ore that they import they use dollars to pay other countries that are still part of the dollar area and still willing to keep adding these dollars to their official monetary reserves instead of holding gold bonnie faulkner well it is kind of surprising michael that countries haven t started doing this a lot sooner michael hudson there has been political pressure not to withdraw from the dollar debt system if countries act independently they risk being overthrown it takes a strong government to resist american interference and dirty tricks to put its own country first instead of following the u s advisors and agents who pay them to serve the u s economy rather than their own or to resist brainwashing by university of chicago s junk economics bonnie faulkner how far along is the dollar s demise as the world s reserve currency michael hudson it s already slowing trump is doing everything he can to accelerate it by threatening that if foreign countries continue to recycle their export earnings into dollars raising the dollar s exchange rate we ll accuse them of manipulating their currency so he would like to end it all by the end of his second term in 2024 bonnie faulkner what would the united states look like if the dollar is no longer the world s reserve currency michael hudson if it continues to let wall street do the economic planning the economy will look like that of argentina bonnie faulkner and what does argentina look like michael hudson a narrow oligarchy at the top keeping labor at the bottom taking away labor s rights to unionize an economy whose financial and military sectors have won the class war bonnie faulkner china with its belt and road infrastructure project is now buying gold on the open market as are a number of other countries has the western banking system penetrated china and if so how would you characterize china s banking system michael hudson there s an attempt by the united states to penetrate china in the recent trade agreements china did permit u s banks to create their own credit i m not sure that this is going to really take off now that trump is accelerating the trade war but basically in america you have private banks extending credit to corporations in china you have the government banks extending the loans that saves china from having a financial crisis in the way that the united states does about 12 percent of american companies are said to be zombie companies they re already insolvent not able to make a profit after paying their heavy debt service but banks are still giving them enough credit to stay in business so they won t have to go bankrupt and create a crisis china doesn t have that problem because when chinese industry and factories are not able to pay the public bank of china can simply forgive the debt its choice is clear either it can let companies go bankrupt and be sold at a low price to some buyer mainly an american or it can wipe the bad debts off the books if china had been crazy enough to have student loans and leave its graduates impoverished instead of providing free universities china s central bank could simply write off the student loans no investors would lose because the banks are owned by the government its position is if you re a factory we don t want you to have to close down and unemploy your labor we ll just write down the debt and if your employees are having a really hard time we ll just write down their debts so that they can spend their money on goods and services to help expand our internal market america s banks are owned by the stockholders and bondholders who would never let chase manhattan or citibank or wells fargo just forgive their various categories of loans that s why public banking is so much more efficient from an economy wide level than private banks it s why banking should be a public utility not privatized bonnie faulkner can you explain further how writing down debts is good for the economy michael hudson well think of the alternative to writing down debts if you don t write down america s student debts the graduates are going to have to pay so much of the student debt service now to the government that they re not going to have enough money to be able to buy a house they won t have enough money to get married they won t have enough money to buy goods and services it means that most people who can buy houses are graduates with trust funds students whose parents are rich enough that they didn t have to take out a student loan to pay for their children s education these hereditary families are rich enough to buy them their own apartment that s why the american economy is polarizing between people who inherit enough money to be able to have their own housing and budgets free of student loans and other debts compared to families that are debt strapped and running deeper into debt and without much savings this financial bifurcation is making us poorer yet neoliberal economic theory sees this as a competitive advantage for them and for employers poverty is not a problem to be solved it is the solution to their own aim of profitability bonnie faulkner so is this whole privatization scheme particularly the privatization of the banking system and privatizing a lot of infrastructure what s bankrupting the united states michael hudson yes just as it s bankrupted england and other countries that followed thatcherism or the neo liberal philosophy since about 1980

capital flows to emerging markets ems has resumed since the first quarter q1 of 2019 11 months after its outflow from these markets the central bank of egypt cbe announced in its monetary policy report the direction of capital flows depends on the outlook for economic growth and the development of global trade tensions the cbe said it added that the international bond yields have continued to decline since the beginning of the year in line with the lower risk margin in ems meanwhile the cbe referred to the ongoing recovery of the gdp growth supported by structural reforms pointing out that the rise in net exports was supported by the growth of real gdp during q4 of 2018 according to the report the contribution of local bank financing to the state s fiscal deficit declined during q1 of 2019 on another note the cbe said since may 2018 household savers have tended to invest more in conventional saving forms such as deposits in banks operating in the egyptian market for three years and more it indicated a decrease in the rate of deposit interest to 12 and a stability on loans at 17 7 in march 2019 the cbe expected the international food commodity prices to rise in 2020 and that the cost of most petroleum products will be covered in addition to the fact that the automatic pricing mechanism will be applied locally according to cost developments the report highlighted that economic growth of egypt s external environment continued to soften during q4 of 2018 registering 2 5 down from 2 7 in q3 and from 3 2 in q4 of 2017 the highest pace since 2011 economic growth in advanced economies continued to ease for the fourth consecutive quarter to register 1 4 in q4 of 2018 compared to 1 8 in q3 of 2018 as slower growth in the euro area and the united kingdom more than offset a stronger growth in japan meanwhile economic growth in the united states remained unchanged in q4 of 2018 compared to the previous quarter on the other hand economic growth in emerging economies stabilised in q4 of 2018 at 4 9 after maintaining continuous improvement between q4 of 2015 and q2 of 2018 higher growth in russia offset slower growth in china india and brazil compared to the previous quarter the report read it noted that headline inflation of egypt s external environment continued to decline in january and february 2019 registering an average of 1 9 compared to 2 3 in q4 of 2018 inflation in advanced economies declined in january and february 2019 registering an average of 1 5 down from 2 0 in q4 of 2018 meanwhile the cbe added that inflation in emerging economies stabilised in january and february 2019 registering an average of 2 9 after accelerating to 3 0 in q3 of 2018 the deceleration of the inflation rate in china brazil and india offset the acceleration of the inflation in russia compared to the previous quarter it noted global trade growth declines for 5th consecutive quarter moreover the report stressed that annual global trade growth continued to decline for the fifth consecutive quarter q4 of 2018 to register 1 4 compared to 3 6 in q3 of 2018 and down from a peak of 5 3 in q3 of 2017 it explained that brent crude oil prices increased for the third consecutive month in march 2019 registering an average of 66 1 per barrel compared to an average of 57 4 per barrel in december 2018 opec and its partners continued production cuts until june 2019 while production from the us continued to increase international food prices using the domestic consumer price index cpi basket weights of core food items continued to decline on annual terms in march 2019 for the ninth consecutive month however by a weaker magnitude since december 2018 the decline was mainly due to red meat dairy products and oils as supply conditions improved the report added that the federal reserve system kept its policy rate unchanged in january and march 2019 after raising it by 25 basis points bps in december 2018 marking the fourth policy rate hike in 2018 moreover the federal reserve decided to slow the pace of its balance sheet unwinding plan which started in october 2017 by slowing down the reduction of its holding of government debt starting may 2019 before ending the programme in september 2019 meanwhile the european central bank also kept its policy rate unchanged in january and march 2019 while it decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations with a maturity of two years between september 2019 and march 2021 each furthermore the bank of england kept its policy rate unchanged in february and march 2019 after raising it by 25 bps in august 2018 for the second time since november 2017 the report read the cbe added that capital flows returned to ems in q1 of 2019 after 11 months of outflows that started in february 2018 the return of international capital to ems was mainly supported by a monetary policy normalisation pause in advanced economies however the direction of capital flows remains subject to the economic activity growth outlook as well as the prospects of further escalation of trade tensions elsewhere the cbe explained that the hydrocarbon trade balance registered a surplus for the first time since q4 of 2013 while the current account deficit widened after improving on annual terms for seven consecutive quarters between q4 of 2016 and q2 of 2018 the current account deficit widened in q4 of 2018 a less favourable contribution from remittances net service receipts and the non hydrocarbon trade deficit has more than offset the more favourable contribution from the hydrocarbon surplus and net investment income the report read nevertheless the deficit of net exports of goods and services continued to narrow in q4 of 2018 on annual terms for the eighth consecutive quarter this was due to a more favourable contribution from imports of goods and services mainly those related to the hydrocarbon sector which more than offset the less favourable contribution from exports the cbe explained that the hydrocarbon trade balance continued to improve on annual terms for the fourth consecutive quarter to register a surplus in q4 of 2018 for the first time since q4 of 2013 the improvement was mainly driven by lower imports which coincided with the accelerating annual pace of domestic natural gas production furthermore the non hydrocarbon trade deficit continued to widen on annual terms in q4 of 2018 for the fifth consecutive quarter this was mainly due to a less favourable contribution from imports which more than offset the more favourable contribution from exports the report noted that the service surplus continued to increase in q4 of 2018 on annual terms for the eighth consecutive quarter yet its pace of growth declined to the lowest level since q1 of 2017 the slower annual pace was mainly due to a less favourable contribution from net receipts from tourism as well as other services which more than offset a more favourable contribution from transportation excluding government services and suez canal tolls meanwhile remittances declined on annual terms in q4 of 2018 for the first time since q2 of 2016 net foreign direct investment fdi inflows resumed its annual decline in q4 of 2018 for the second consecutive quarter due to higher gross outflows after witnessing an annual increase in q2 of 2018 for the first quarter since q2 of 2017 portfolio flows excluding eurobonds continued to register a net outflow in q4 of 2018 for the third consecutive quarter amid unfavourable global conditions for emerging markets though at a slower pace compared with the previous two quarters this however was mostly offset by net inflows from commercial banks net foreign assets meanwhile gross international reserves stabilised in april 2019 for the second consecutive month at 44 2bn after increasing in february 2019 supported by the issuance of eurobonds by the ministry of finance the report read real gdp growth rose to 5 5 in q4 of 2018 the report highlights that real gdp growth rose to 5 5 in q4 of 2018 from 5 3 in q3 while unemployment rate dropped to its lowest rate since 2010 it explained that higher net external demand for egyptian goods and services reinforced a more balanced expenditure structure and supported the rebound of economic growth since the fiscal year fy 2017 18 meanwhile the contribution of domestic demand to gdp growth remained contained and the unemployment rate dropped to 8 9 in december 2018 the lowest rate since december 2010 the cbe added that the recent improvement in the contribution of net exports was mainly driven by the continued drop in real imports while the growth of real exports was slightly strengthened after four feeble consecutive quarters on the other hand the contribution of private domestic demand to gdp growth weakened due to the drop in the contribution of private consumption and investments meanwhile public domestic demand stabilised during the same period as the slight rebound of public consumption contribution was offset by the slight drop in the contribution of public investments it explained that at the sectoral level growth stabilised compared to the previous quarter as the boost in the contribution of public sector to gdp growth was offset by the weakness in the private sector the increased contribution of the public sector to the gdp was primarily due to the rising contribution of natural gas extractions while that of other sectors remained stable the contribution of the private sector to the gdp growth dropped due to weaker growth in the tourism sector which more than offset the improvement in the construction sector in addition available leading indicators for the non hydrocarbon sector mostly point to weakening activity in q1 of 2019 the purchasing managers index pmi average level in q1 of 2019 weakened compared to q4 of 2018 despite improving in march 2019 and the manufacturing index continued to contract in january 2019 albeit by a slightly lesser degree compared to q4 of 2018 furthermore the number of tourist nights contracted on annual terms in january 2019 for the first time since november 2016 and total car sales grew on average at a slower pace in january and february 2019 compared to the average pace registered in q4 of 2018 on the other hand suez canal net tonnage grew on annual terms at a slightly higher pace in january and february 2019 on average compared to q4 of 2018 in the hydrocarbon sector natural gas production continued to increase strongly on annual terms yet at slower pace during january 2019 compared to the average pace in q4 of 2018 broad money growth continues to decline supported by fiscal consolidation following the fading of the exchange rate revaluation effect in q4 of 2017 annual m2 growth continued to decline to an average of 11 6 in q1 of 2019 supported by fiscal consolidation and the containment of other broad money counterpart assets growth in q1 of 2019 the negative annual contribution of foreign nonbank financing of the fiscal budget deficit eased in line with the monetary policy normalisation pause in advanced economies this was more than offset by the decreased contribution of bank financing of the fiscal deficit in addition to the expected drop in contribution of external financing compared to q4 of 2018 according to the cbe other components of counterpart assets m2 claims on the private sector which slightly picked up the decline in m2 growth favourably coincided with an annual increase in broad money velocity which suggests lower room for noninflationary money growth meanwhile following its decline between q2 of 2017 and q1 of 2018 the contribution of claims on the private sector to m2 growth continued to pick up in q1 of 2019 similarly inflation adjusted l c claims on the private sector continued to witness annual increases since q1 of 2018 after recording annual contractions in 2017 the recovery was especially evident for claims on the private business sector while claims on the household sector recovered by a relatively weaker magnitude within the components of m2 cic as a percent of l c deposits in m2 continued to decline in q1 of 2019 for the third consecutive quarter recording a ratio below its long term historical average which suggests lessening currency holding behaviour meanwhile the annual growth of f c deposits in us dollar as well as the dollarisation ratio defined as f c deposits to total deposits in m2 broadly stabilised during q1of 2019 moreover the structure of household deposits in l c continued to be dominated by deposits for more than three years since may 2018 following one and a half years of dominance by deposits less than three years amid the introduction of 1 5 year saving certificates at a higher rate compared to longer term saving certificate rates the reversal of the structure of household deposits is consistent with redemptions of these certificates since may 2018 given their cancellation by public banks in late april 2018 the report revealed that annual growth of m0 adjusted by total excess liquidity continued to decline in q1 of 2019 for the sixth consecutive quarter due to cbe balance sheet operations which lowered excess liquidity growth the money multiplier measured as the ratio between local currency components of broad money and m0 as defined above increased slightly in q1 of 2019 following its broad stability between q4 of 2017 and q4 of 2018 this was mainly due to lower excess liquidity as a ratio of l c deposits in m2 the cbe said in another context the cbe noted that real monetary conditions remained tight backed by receding inflationary pressures as well as previous policy rate increases notwithstanding the cumulative 300 bps policy rate cuts in q1 of 2018 and q1 of 2019 after declining between december 2018 and mid february 2019 excess liquidity rose between mid february and mid march 2019 before stabilising to record an average of egp 734 5bn 13 8 of the gdp during the maintenance period ending of 8 april 2019 compared to egp 665 4bn 12 5 of the gdp recorded on average during the maintenance period ending 11 february 2019 meanwhile interbank activity remained relatively stable since april 2018 with interbank rates remaining below the policy rate by around 30 bps as higher long term absorption tenors offset the effect of higher short term absorption of excess liquidity concurrently the interbank yield curve shifted downward post the 100 transmission of the 100 bp policy rate cut on 14 february 2019 moreover the cbe added that yields for l c government securities declined to 14 0 net of tax in march 2019 and 13 8 during the first two issuances in april 2019 the lowest since may 2018 this compares to the 15 6 recorded on average during q4 of 2018 and january 2019 prior to the 100 bp policy rate cut in february 2019 the 1 6p p decline in march 2019 was due to the increase in demand reflected by higher coverage ratio which recorded 2 3x in march 2019 compared to 2 0x recorded during q4 of 2018 and january 2019 before declining to 1 6x during the first two issuances in april after being affected by em developments nevertheless treasury yields inched down further during the beginning of april 2019 supported by lower accepted to required ratio which was more than enough to offset the decline in demand the accepted to required ratio recorded 0 8x during the first two issuances in april 2019 compared to 1 1x recorded in march 2019 and 1 0x in q4 of 2018 and january 2019 meanwhile egyptian eurobond yields have been declining since the beginning of 2019 in line with the improvement in the risk premium for ems after increasing during most of 2018 moreover egypt s cds spreads remained relatively low compared to the majority of peers with similar sovereign credit rating furthermore egypt s credit rating was upgraded by moody s in april 2019 and by fitch ratings in march 2019 following the upgrade by s p in may 2018 in the banking sector march 2019 data reflected partial transmission of the 100 bp policy rate cut on 14 february 2019 to rates of new deposits which declined to 12 0 the limited transmission in the magnitude of 0 7x the policy rate cut was due to adjustment of flexible deposit rates as fixed rate saving certificates more than or equal to three years remained broadly unchanged the report added meanwhile rates of new loans remained relatively stable to record 17 7 in march 2019 due to the weaker impact of loans at subsidised interest rates as a result interest rate margins widened to 5 7p p compared to 4 6p p recorded on average between april 2018 and january 2019 in equity markets the cbe stated real prices recovered since the beginning of the year after declining in 2018 supported by net buying mainly by egyptian investors since the beginning of the year the egx 30 usd index recovered by a cumulative 20 outpacing the msci emerging markets index s 11 meanwhile real unit prices in q1 of 2019 inched down in the secondary market as the demand continued to shift from the secondary market toward the primary market given more flexible payment plans offered by numerous developers in the wake of tight liquidity conditions annual core inflation records single digits for 9th consecutive month the cbe said that annual headline inflation recorded 14 2 in march 2019 compared to 14 4 and 12 7 in february and january 2019 respectively meanwhile annual core inflation continued to record single digits for the ninth consecutive month averaging 8 6 between july 2018 and march 2019 the lowest rate in more than two years during q1 of 2019 annual headline inflation has been generally affected by unfavourable base effects given exceptionally low monthly inflation rates in january and february 2018 this comes after annual headline inflation was affected by fiscal consolidation measures as well as price volatility of fresh vegetables due to transitory supply shocks in the second half of 2018 the report stated nevertheless given the containment of underlying inflationary pressures annual inflation of services and retail items continued to record single digits for the sixth and fifth consecutive month respectively while annual inflation of core food items continued to record single digits for the tenth consecutive month in the meantime annual inflation of volatile food and regulated items remained elevated which contributed to widening of the spread between annual headline and core inflation rates consequently the cbe explained contribution of non food items to annual headline inflation has been broadly stable since november 2018 while contribution of food items experienced volatility since august 2018 recently annual contribution of food items remained broadly stable in march 2019 after increasing in january and february 2019 mainly due to volatile food items following its decline in november and december 2018 meanwhile monthly headline inflation was mainly driven by food inflation since august 2018 while non food inflation has been contained inflation of fresh vegetables was the main contributor to food inflation despite higher than expected price increases in february 2019 fresh vegetable inflation was broadly in line with seasonal patterns except for higher potato prices this comes after a supply shock specific to potatoes and tomatoes elevated inflation of fresh vegetables in september and october 2018 however it was partially reversed in november 2018 and by a larger extent in december 2018 in march 2019 potato prices increased for the second consecutive month contributing on average by 30 1 to monthly headline inflation prices of tomatoes declined after increasing for two consecutive months in the meantime according to the cbe prices of core food items inched up slightly since january 2019 mainly due to higher prices of poultry which increased for the third consecutive month in march 2019 contributing on average by 15 8 to monthly headline inflation in addition prices of rice as well as fish and seafood increased for the sixth and third consecutive month respectively average monthly core food inflation witnessed domestically since january 2019 was largely consistent with monthly international core food inflation after diverging between august and december 2018 international core food inflation continued to be mainly driven by prices of dairy products and red meat since december 2018 while contribution of poultry prices was negative since february 2019 finally after the cbe s monetary policy committee decided to cut key policy rates by 100 bps in its meeting on 14 february 2019 it decided in its meeting on 28 march 2019 that current policy rates are appropriate to achieve the inflation target of 9 3p p in q4 of 2020 which was declared in december 2018 real gdp growth is expected to continue recovering benefiting from continued structural reforms despite being affected by potential fiscal consolidation measures the primary fiscal balance is targeted to record a surplus of 2 0 of the gdp in fy 2018 19 compared to a surplus of 0 1 of the gdp in fy 2017 18 and a deficit of 1 8 of the gdp in fy 2016 17 and is targeted to maintain this surplus thereafter meanwhile the overall fiscal deficit is targeted to decline to 8 4 and 7 2 of the gdp in 2018 19 and 2019 20 respectively compared to 9 7 in 2017 18 and 10 9 in 2016 17 and is targeted to continue declining thereafter the outlook for brent crude oil price incorporated in the domestic inflation outlook remained unchanged compared to the previous monetary policy report while spot prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply side factors as well as geopolitical risks domestically cost recovery for most fuel products is expected to be reached and automatic fuel price indexation to underlying costs is expected to be implemented meanwhile international food price forecasts relevant to egypt s consumption basket are expected to decline slightly during 2019 before increasing in 2020 according to the cbe s report in addition to international commodity price developments risks surrounding the inflation outlook from the global economy continue to include trade tensions and economic growth developments in the interim domestic risks continue to include the timing and magnitude of potential fiscal consolidation measures and the evolution of inflation expectations
disasters avoided the reform less budget unneeded spending increases all across the board and the march to a flatter fairer tax code something for everyone to hate in this budget something for everyone to love in this budget july 15 2019 executive summary the 2019 21 wisconsin state budget is now law after months of debate numerous public hearings countless hours making its way through committee dozens of amendments voted on and almost 80 vetoes assembly bill 56 the state budget bill has been signed into law by governor tony evers and is now 2019 wisconsin act 9 there is something for everyone to love in this budget from fiscal conservatives far left progressives republicans taxpayers democrats big government loving special interests lobbyists to local governments and something in this budget for everyone to hate that makes this budget different than any other budget in recent memory it really should come as no surprise however given the fact that we have divided government with democrat tony evers as governor and both houses of the legislature comfortably controlled by republicans disasters avoided big labor the big loser to fully understand how we got to this place you have to start at the beginning when evers introduced his budget proposal in late february evers budget proposal wasn t just a big liberal wish list but a radical progressive s best dream simply put evers introduced the most irresponsible and anti taxpayer budget in recent memory assembly speaker robin vos r rochester described the evers budget as a big liberal wish list looking at the expansive list of progressive policies that vastly grow the size and scope of government it is hard to argue with that description from medicaid expansion the end of recent welfare work requirements an unneeded increase in the state s minimum wage a green pipe dream to make the state carbon free the creation of many new government programs an assault on proven education reform programs the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana to the end of the property tax freeze the budget wasn t just a big liberal wish list but a radical progressive s best dream as proposed evers budget would have also hiked the gas tax and tied it to inflation for a total gas tax increase of nearly 10 cents per gallon raised taxes on job creating manufacturers by limiting the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit raised taxes on retirees by ending a long term capital gains tax exemption repealed the state s right to work law restored the state and local prevailing wage rolled back tax protections that have led to a property tax freeze giving local units of government more power to raise property taxes frozen enrollment in school choice programs ended the special needs scholarship program stopped new independent charter schools from opening until 2023 raised the minimum wage to 8 25 in 2020 followed by annual 75 cent increases until it reaches 10 50 in 2023 then tying it to inflation and creating a task force to study how to get to a 15 per hour minimum wage for everyone raised the minimum wage for government workers to 15 per hour in 2021 spent 5 million to provide internet access for welfare recipients eliminated work requirements for able bodied adults with school aged dependents eliminated drug testing for most public assistance programs created a new statutory goal for a minimum broadband speed across the state tied revenue limits for school districts to inflation deferred to agency rules and guidance documents bypassing the legislature and broadening the powers of the administrative state created a 2 billion structural deficit while raising general fund taxes by 1 3 billion and local property taxes by untold millions more and much much more thankfully the republican led joint finance committee jfc quickly removed all of these disasters in its first executive session on the budget it stripped out 131 policy items and more than 1 billion in tax increases almost every single big government provision except for gas tax indexing was pulled out in jfc s first budget action as we examine the final product today it is important that we take time to remember how bad evers original budget was and give republicans credit for removing all of this bad public policy medicaid expansion would have devastated health care affordability for the average wisconsinite pushing up premiums and severely limiting access to care low income individuals who currently have subsidized private plans for cents on the dollar would be forced onto a government plan with less access to providers and worse health outcomes it would also push thousands more wisconsinites onto a system that is already struggling to stay sustainable just 2 6 wisconsin workers support each medicaid recipient today in 1998 7 2 workers supported each recipient as it stands medicaid already has a serious math problem pushing enrollment even higher would only make health outcomes access and the program s cost worse if you are still not sure if medicaid expansion is a bad idea just look at the states that have accepted it and what a financial hardship it has been for those states medicaid spending in ohio for example skyrocketed 35 percent in four years from 18 9 billion to 25 7 billion between fiscal year 2013 and 2017 in arizona costly visits to the emergency room have jumped more than 300 percent and providers have shifted an additional 700 million in costs onto private plans after the medicaid expansion in rhode island medicaid enrollment ballooned 63 percent and state spending on the program has increased 25 percent since expansion forcing the state to consider a new payroll tax on employers it also would expand welfare in a time of unprecedented economic growth the final budget delivers substantial increases in health care and medical assistance funding without using money from a debt ridden federal government that has failed to keep funding promises to states those are among the many reasons why republicans fought so hard to keep the idea out of the budget the same can be said of republicans defense of worker freedom it s no secret that big labor targeted gov walker as public enemy number one and made removing him from office its number one priority in the entire country no one should have been surprised when evers first budget proposal handsomely rewarded his big labor allies with a full out assault on worker freedom and the taxpayer evers proposed bringing back big labor s favorite trifecta repealing right to work reinstating the prevailing wage law and forcing large public works construction projects to use project labor agreements wisconsin s previous prevailing wage statute which arbitrarily and unnecessarily tied wages on taxpayer funded construction projects to inflated rates paid by unions was repealed for local and state projects by gov walker without interference from the government wages are set by the market and driven by competition saving wisconsin taxpayers millions of dollars remember the case of the grafton water tower evers budget also would have eliminated wisconsin s right to work law it s called right to work precisely because it prohibits private sector labor organizations from making compulsory union dues a condition of employment wisconsin workers have shown en masse that they don t want to join unions active membership in the national education association fell by 42 percent from 2013 to 2018 the percent of wisconsin workers who belong to a union fell from 15 percent in 2008 to 8 1 percent in 2018 simply put if unions provided a service that members thought was worthy such dramatic drop offs would not have occurred clearly workers are voting with their feet and they are voting that they do not need unions evers budget would have reinstated project labor agreements plas for public works projects local governments beholden to big labor use plas to stipulate that only union firms can bid on a project shutting out competition and dramatically increasing the cost of projects that taxpayers pay for ultimately much of what makes the 2019 21 budget a good document is marked by what s not in it that is thanks to republicans and their willingness to stand up to big labor and the far left that also makes big labor the unquestioned big loser of the 2019 2021 state budget debate finally we would be remiss to not mention one last issue left untouched in the 2019 21 budget act 10 walker s signature 2011 reform was repeatedly slammed by the now governor on the campaign trail and in years past nowhere does the budget roll back taxpayer protections created by the law including increased contribution levels for public sector employee benefits or annual union recertification votes for the taxpayer that is a major disaster averted a fiscal arms race making everyone but the taxpayer happy there s no way around it this budget spends a lot of money when evers released his budget plan in late february republicans slammed the new governor for spending far more than the state could afford yet in the end republicans backtracked on the fiscal austerity rhetoric and in many cases ended up spending a lot more than what was necessary in what can only be called a great disappointment for taxpayers legislative republicans decided in many instances to spend more than they have in recent memory and in some cases spend more than evers original proposal evers had proposed increasing total government jobs by 701 full time positions over the biennium that would have brought the total number of all funds state positions to 71 990 57 in 2020 jfc s plan increased total positions by 482 up to 71 771 59 by 2020 that s still a sizable increase plus this budget gives all state employees 2 percent raises in each year of the biennium and by constantly adding to state rolls those types of increases will only be more expensive in the future in what can only be called a great disappointment for taxpayers legislative republicans tried to keep up with the liberals when it came to government largess in some cases they even outdid evers original spending proposals prison guards personal care workers nursing homes and family care direct care workers get considerably more funding than evers requested taxpayers should also question the wisdom of pumping 655 4 million more gpr into the status quo educational system that fails too many children and is experiencing flat enrollment in this biennium state support to k 12 schools will reach more than 14 billion and dpi s total budget spends north of 15 2 billion evers had proposed a 1 6 billion increase for the agency he headed until january including more than 600 million to increase special education categorical aids the final budget sends 330 million more into the equalization aid formula and 97 million more for special education categorical aids along with a litany of other changes still jfc rejected the vast majority of evers proposed changes to the school funding formula such as adding another weight for impoverished students counting them as 1 2 pupils instead of 1 0 for funding purposes that led evers supporters to slam the education plan calling it a 900 million cut only in madison and the fantasy land of the nonsensical progressive is a 655 million increase in spending described as a cut lost in this debate is the fact that wisconsin s k 12 population has stayed relatively flat for many years if we are not experiencing a huge influx of new elementary kids to educate why do our schools need 600 million in new funds and this 600 million increase is on top of the 600 million increase included in the 2017 2019 state budget over a billion dollars in new funding to educate the same number of kids are we seeing any noticeable return on our increased investment also lost in this debate is the fact that more and more families are choosing other educational choices outside of the public education system choice charter and home schooling are all growing in popularity that s no surprise given that statewide english proficiency sits at just 44 percent and math proficiency at 41 percent the k 12 educational system has continually failed many wisconsin students with thousands of new uw freshmen requiring remedial math or english those classes come with zero credit and the cost of full tuition putting students behind before they even begin plus many of these are students who were told they were doing well in school more than half of wisconsin s five star high schools sent more than 1 000 students who needed math remediation to uw and when just 54 percent of our public education dollars reach the classroom we must ask how hundreds of millions of dollars will improve student achievement for their part legislative republicans acknowledged the system is broken but they didn t take the opportunity to couple a significant funding increase with required better outcomes and meaningful systematic reform the same can be said for the uw system and the 220 million more it received compared to the last budget like the k 12 system enrollment at uw has slowly fallen over the years with a strong economy and record low unemployment young people now know that the math has changed it s no longer a given that taking on tens of thousands of dollars in student debt will pay off in the long run and enrollment trends reflect that still the capital budget sends over 1 billion in new funding for building projects across the uw system numerous campuses like uw eau claire and uw milwaukee will get brand new buildings and every campus will see millions more in improvement projects before the jfc vote on the capital budget finance co chair john nygren r marinette spoke passionately on how broken the system is he lamented that taxpayers pay uw lobbyists that then lobby the state for more money he also lambasted the fact that uw officials are the drivers of new projects setting rates and budgets for new buildings knowing that the legislature usually just goes along with the plan nygren is exactly right on this but he and every other jfc republican voted for the package it s refreshing to see legislators make strong arguments at the table but it d be more refreshing if they would actually pass the reforms they say they want the health care debate brought a similar tone republicans held strong in refusing to expand medicaid but they instead agreed to send 1 6 billion in all funds to dhs of that increase 917 million all funds is the cost to continue price tag for the state s massive medical assistance programs rather than pursuing innovative reforms in taxpayer provided health care programs like direct primary care self funded association health plans limited duration health plans and dental therapy jfc pumped more money into the medicaid system they acknowledge is broken too many politicians are content just throwing more money at these programs and these problems without addressing the fundamental causes of these problems and without making needed reforms to these programs like so many other parts of the state budget the new incredibly generous funding for dhs came with little to no reforms attached for taxpayers this is frustrating and a huge missed opportunity to make wisconsin a better place to live too many politicians are content just throwing more money at these programs without addressing the fundamental causes of the problems and without making needed reforms to these programs the reform less budget as we ve written above on issues from k 12 education medicaid higher education welfare reform to the capital budget legislators enacted few reforms to go along with the billions more in new spending they provided one possible reason for this missed opportunity evers has the most powerful line item veto in the country the majority of the few reforms contained in this budget were predictably vetoed out by the governor nevertheless it s crucial that both sides fight for their beliefs and make their positions known taxpayers deserve an honest and genuine debate about the direction of our great state if the capital building program is clearly broken what s the harm in proposing a groundbreaking new strategy to fix it debating an idea in public is always better than agreeing to compromise behind closed doors why didn t we have a debate about the needed reform of mps why didn t we have a debate about the remedial education crisis and the fact that hundreds of wisconsin high schools send thousands of students to the uw system unprepared to pass basic english and math tests why didn t we have a debate about the need to empower parents to choose a school that s right for their children why didn t we have a debate about the size scope and cost of state government apparently the only area that needs reform transportation republicans deserve kudos for including one important transportation reform in their department of transportation dot omnibus motion a pilot program for design build projects rather than hiring a construction company after a road is designed this active building method would bring in the construction company during the design phase the theory is that the company can apply its practical experience to find efficiencies and cost savings that dot engineers might otherwise miss evers used his veto pen to take out the part about it being a pilot program meaning it is now officially in the dot s tool box still many fiscal hawks wanted more accountability for the troubled agency giving rise to a separate transportation reform package that moved through the legislative process in order to secure enough republican votes in the senate earlier today an assembly committee held a lengthy hearing on a package of dot reform bills repsanfelippo explained that yes there are pressing needs but that makes reforming the department all the more important wibudget wiright wipolitics pic twitter com sbftqwgw7b maciver news service newsmaciver june 12 2019 one reform bill proposed outside of the budget expands the number of road plans on the shelf so that the project pipeline can be managed more efficiently another piece of legislation in the transportation reform package targets a practice that has cost taxpayers a lot of money single bid contracts the bill would require the dot to rebid projects that receive but one bid if that bid exceeds the department s estimated cost of work by 10 percent or more a fallback provision would allow the dot to avoid the requirement in cases of a threat to public safety if jfc approves as maciver news service recently reported the state has awarded 58 single bid contracts worth 309 million since january dot secretary designee craig thompson who spent years working on behalf of road builders and other transportation interests now heads a state agency that refuses to release the original cost estimates even after the contracts are awarded as maciver news service recently reported the state has awarded 58 single bid contracts worth 309 million since january the state highway program audit in 2017 found that one bid contracts cost the state an average of 4 5 million a year from 2006 to 2015 the most controversial reform bill would require local governments considering implementing vehicle registration fees or wheel taxes to first get approval from voters through referendum more controversially the measure demands communities with existing wheel taxes to take the question to voters within 18 months of proposing a fee increase another reform measure before the legislature would create a subgrade efficiency provision in state law allowing contractors to use dot approved alternative lower cost materials for the under layer of road projects the change could lead to big cost savings for the contractor and ultimately the taxpayer a related reform would require the dot to use project materials for sources on the dot right of way rather than paying higher costs to source and transport materials from more distant locations while that package moved through the legislature as its own set of bills the assembly also amended the budget bill on the floor in order to ensure its passage in the senate that amendment did away with a jfc transportation provision that would have given the committee the authority to approve the implementation of a mileage based fee instead any recommendations from a study committee would have to be included in the department of transportation funding request for the next budget critics worried that a decision on tolling recommendations and the controversial mileage fee would ultimately be in the hands of one committee not the full legislature that became a moot point as evers vetoed the tolling and mileage studies out of the final budget implementing these reforms in the dot became even more urgent with the passing of the state budget the dot received a 600 million funding boost in the new state budget which included the enumeration of two new major projects a tax cut to bring fiscal conservatives home continuing the march towards a flatter more equitable tax structure in wisconsin wisconsin has long had one of the country s most regressive individual income tax systems the bottom tax rate of 4 percent is among the very highest in the country for low earners walker made progress in flattening the tax rate to benefit every single wisconsinite but the lowest rates have remained particularly punitive the budget act along with a separate bill championed by sen dale kooyenga r brookfield and rep jessie rodriguez r oak brook lowers the bottom two individual income tax rates in 2019 the bottom rate currently 4 percent will drop to 3 89 percent the second rate of 5 84 percent will shift downward to 5 08 percent in 2020 both rates will fall even further with the lowest rate moving to 3 76 percent and the second rate to 4 93 percent between both sets of changes the average income tax decrease will be 91 in 2019 and another 124 in 2020 totaling 215 in income tax relief over the biennium for the average filer these changes will benefit every single taxpayer in the state and reducing the bottom two tax brackets will help middle class earners the most the bulk of the tax relief in dollars will go toward those earning between 30 000 and 60 000 annually maciver has long argued that a flat tax system is the most equitable and fairest method of taxation while we d prefer a flat 3 percent rate across the board any flattening of tax rates is a substantial win that should be celebrated plus republicans achieved those tax cuts of over 500 million without raising taxes on other people evers proposed tax cuts were not true tax cuts at all but instead they were tax shifts his plan would have limited the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit mac that move would punish job creators driving the growth in wisconsin s economy evers would have also stripped back long term capital gains exclusions a change that would punish retirees and rob their nest eggs not only was evers plan based upon a punitive tax shift but his middle income tax cut would not have changed the actual income tax rates which are the heart of the issue his plan would have given middle class earners 10 percent of their net tax liability back or 100 whichever is greater buying down the income tax rates rather than tinkering with credits is a much more effective direct way to fix wisconsin s income tax structure the long road ahead jfc s budget leaves a 1 4 billion structural deficit for the beginning of the 2021 23 budget cycle that s less than evers almost 2 billion deficit but it s still a massive figure walker took heat for leaving structural deficits in his budgets but taxpayers could rest assured that the former governor would never raise taxes to fill a budget hole we hope legislators remember the hard working taxpayer who foots the bill in the years to come when these tough decisions will need to be made now they shouldn t be so sure evers original budget proposal would have raised taxes by close to 2 billion when considering the general fund and locals abilities to raise property tax levies our governor is clearly an eager tax and spend liberal who will want to increase taxes to solve any structural deficit or budget hole will legislative republicans be strong enough to just say no to new taxes if the economy turns south the state went into this budget cycle with a 753 million surplus higher than expected following months of strong economic growth yet the legislature spent all that and more on various programs leaving the state with a 1 4 billion structural gamble with taxpayers on the hook all it would take is a single bad year for the economy an escalation of the trade war or any number of other crises for any future surpluses to quickly turn into deficits and two years from now we ll be back in the same position with stakeholders from every corner of the state coming to the legislature with hats and hands out asking for more money as we know it ll never be enough we will need to do better next time full analysis k 12 education as former state superintendent of the department of public instruction dpi gov tony evers made k 12 education a top priority in his 2019 21 biennial budget proposal that is as long as students attend the types of schools he prefers evers massive spending proposal called for nearly 1 6 billion more for dpi over the biennium another record hike over the prior budget s increase of more than 630 million it would have dramatically reworked the school funding formula based on a proposal long championed by evers called fair funding for our future it also drastically restricted access to educational choice jfc pulled back on evers proposal opting to spend 655 4 million more in gpr for dpi the finance committee pulled out every limitation on school choice that evers had proposed leaving the programs untouched the committee also removed the majority of his proposed changes to the school funding formula in the end evers veto pen increased dpi s overall spending to a more than 700 million hike over the biennium the state aid spending increase to dpi is the largest across all agencies with the veto pen districts will receive larger per pupil aid payments for each student up from 654 this year to 742 in each of the next two years that totals nearly 90 million more in overall state spending evers also vetoed out an 18 million program that provides free laptops for all high school freshmen the extra money comes with zero reforms and for a broken education system with flat enrollment in this biennium state support to k 12 schools will reach more than 14 billion in the biennium and dpi s total budget spends north of 15 2 billion evers original proposal included more than 600 million to increase special education categorical aids jfc sent 330 million more into the equalization aid formula 97 million more for special education categorical aids along with a litany of other changes still the finance committee rejected the vast majority of evers proposed changes to the school funding formula such as a weight for impoverished students counting them as 1 2 pupils instead of 1 0 for funding purposes that led evers supporters to slam the education plan calling it a 900 million cut of course only in madison is a 655 million increase described as a cut school districts affected by low revenue limits will be able to raise local property taxes to levy 9 700 per student in 2019 and 10 000 per student in 2020 assembly republicans fought for those changes in the last budget though they were ultimately vetoed by walker who cited property tax concerns lost in this debate is the fact that student enrollment has slowly declined over the years as families opt for other educational choices outside of the public education system in the current school year more than 853 000 children attend wisconsin public schools a figure that has fallen for years at the same time k 12 investments have increased the state continues to spend more money to educate fewer children prior to act 10 benefits costs to districts had been increasing by 4 3 percent annually had that trend continued taxpayers would be paying almost 60 percent more today and for all the claims evers has made on what he believes to be the harmful effects of walker s act 10 his budget does nothing to strip back those reforms school districts have saved at least 3 2 billion on benefits plans since 2011 thanks to their newfound flexibilities even so the majority of the taxpayer funded plans are still incredibly generous especially compared to the private sector those savings are still reverberating in march kenosha school district saved nearly 30 million on health care plans alone by switching providers the district s taxpayers will spend 41 percent less than their projections and individual teachers will come out contributing even less toward their monthly premiums at 26 percent of districts employees pay less than 12 percent toward monthly premiums on single plans years after act 10 s requirement that public sector employees contribute at least 12 percent toward health care costs just 74 percent of school districts comply with the rule for premiums prior to act 10 benefits costs to districts had been increasing by 4 3 percent annually had that trend continued taxpayers would be paying almost 60 percent more today that money adds up in many cases districts freed up dollars to go to the classroom by adjusting their benefits plans wauwatosa school district and mps among them none of those savings are accounted for in state figures that show how much walker put toward education it is billions of dollars previously locked down that districts can now spend on their own priorities walker s public sector collective bargaining reform legislation bent the cost curve for school and ultimately for taxpayers while spending on health care has exploded across the country wisconsin bucked the trend because of act 10 why does this matter simply put if school districts saved 3 2 billion on health care and retirement benefits that money should have been directed to other education programs finally dpi s own figures show just how little districts spend on those priorities state figures show just 54 percent of district spending goes toward instruction just a slim majority of all k 12 education spending reaches the classroom if top heavy overhead were reduced the teachers doing the vast majority of meaningful work in schools could perhaps be better compensated instead the many secondary and tertiary roles schools have taken on directly compete with the primary reason for schools existence educating children full analysis transportation the long fight to raise wisconsin s gas tax was the jumping off point for the state budget s transportation funding debate it s no secret that the road building lobby has been pushing for a gas tax hike for years and given that gov evers picked former road lobbyist craig thompson to lead the department of transportation it s not surprising that the governor included a gas tax hike in his budget proposal that alone would have raised 484 9 million over the biennium but evers didn t stop there he also wanted to index the gas tax which means it would automatically go up every year without the legislature ever voting on it again that second increase would have raised another 41 million in the second year of the budget evers also included some fee increases that brought the grand total for new transportation revenue to 608 million many in the republican led legislature have also been pushing for a gas tax hike for a long time but evers plan seemed like too much even for them instead the legislature chose to boost transportation revenue by 395 million solely through fee increases starting in october title fees will go up 95 light and medium truck registration will go up 100 and annual automobile registration will increase 10 this brings the department of transportation s total budget up to 6 6 billion for this biennium that includes 326 3 million in new bonding down from 401 4 million in the last budget lawmakers praised this as the lowest level of transportation bonding in nearly 20 years unfortunately overall bonding in this budget is at 1 9 billion an all time high from that the state highway rehabilitation program will get 3 3 billion a 320 million increase from last budget the zoo interchange will be completed under this budget it also enumerates two new projects the i 41 expansion and the i 43 expansion in milwaukee and ozaukee counties the budget also provides funding for the wi 15 hortonville bypass which has been discussed for 20 years local governments will get some more help from state taxpayers to run their local transportation programs that includes an increase to general transportation aids gta of 66 2 million that comes out to a 10 percent increase an all time high the local road improvement fund lrip increased by 90 million there s also 5 million in supplemental transportation aids specifically for towns that section also eliminated the requirement for towns to pay for at least 15 percent of their own transportation costs they now have to pay nothing towards their transportation expenses and spend only state aid if they so choose the legislature s budget also included discretionary supplemental grants for additional road improvements for 90 million gov evers vetoed that down to 75 000 and then directed the dot to hang on to it instead of sending it to local governments he explained in his veto message i am also requesting the department of administration secretary not to allot these funds while additional investment in our local transportation needs is welcome this provision creates yet another one time subsidy to the transportation fund and illustrates the missed opportunity to provide a sustainable funding solution that would allow this program to be an ongoing investment in local communities without using the general fund to pay for transportation projects before the veto that discretionary supplemental aid would have meant another 32 million for counties 35 1 million for towns and 22 8 million for municipalities gov evers also used his veto pen to adjust two reforms in the legislature s budget first he took out a preemption for local quarry zoning ordinances that issue drives up the cost of material for state road projects when local governments try to block quarrying operations near the construction sites evers recognized the complexity of the issue which is caught between local control and state fiscal responsibility he says there should be more public debate he also made an interesting change to design build the legislature included it in the budget as a pilot program with a lot of strings attached evers vetoed out the part about it being just a pilot program and immediately put it into effect without the strings attached looking past road funding the budget also provides a 45 2 million boost to the harbor assistance program of which 29 million is expected to benefit mercury marine specifically also 35 million is budgeted to amtrak s hiawatha line for rail projects full analysis health care when he signed the final 2019 21 budget gov evers traded in some of his key campaign pledges medicaid expansion at the top of the list for a boatload of new money offered up by the gop while expanding medicaid was unquestionably off the table from day one a sizable share of the new spending in the republican budget went to the state s behemoth medical assistance ma program just to keep up with the cost of current enrollment the final budget sends 1 6 billion in additional all funds dollars to the department of health services dhs 187 5 million less than what evers had proposed from state gpr coffers that s a 588 million increase for dhs in total the dhs budget rises to 26 2 billion all funds over the biennium a 6 7 percent increase 8 6 billion of that comes from gpr a 7 1 percent increase simply continuing to fund ma is a sizable part of that increase with an all funds price tag of 917 million just in cost to continue funding ma consists mainly of the massive medicaid program out of that massive sum 356 1 million comes from previous state gpr dollars to continue medicaid as is but because the evers budget relied so heavily on a 325 million influx of free federal cash the final budget s 588 million in new gpr spending is only 27 3 million less than what evers proposed the final jfc budget adds 166 3 new full time equivalent positions at dhs 25 74 fewer than evers wanted spending arms race the republican budget now signed into law as 2019 wisconsin act 9 spends 60 million more gpr on disproportionate share dsh payments to health care providers that treat an unusually high number of medicaid patients an effort to make up for the program s abysmal reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals with one of his 78 vetoes evers raised the cap on how much each hospital can receive under this payment by 400 000 final funding figures for nursing homes and direct caregivers like home health care workers were the result of the spending arms race between republicans and evers evers budget proposal called for 8 7 million in fiscal year 2020 and 17 8 million the following year amounting to a combined 2 5 percent increase in fee for service medicaid reimbursement for nursing homes critics challenged evers claim that he was providing an historic boost in funding gop lawmakers responded by upping the spending ante significantly on three home and personal care related programs they touted that their budget far exceeds evers proposal spending 47 6 million more than evers on nursing home reimbursements 74 3 million more on personal care reimbursements and 37 million more on family care direct care payments than the bloated evers budget amid the health services spending bonanza was a bright spot for taxpayers evers initial proposal hiked spending by 45 million on admittedly less traditional health spending an array of nanny state programs shoehorned into the category of health care those would have included non medical services to reduce and prevent health disparities that result from economic and social determinants of health such as housing referral services stress management nutritional counseling transportation coordination etc according to evers budget in brief that proposal was an expansion of the left s beloved cradle to grave set of government programs paid for using tens of millions of precious taxpayer dollars meant for actual health care the final budget omitted this spending walker reinsurance continued the final budget maintains evers request to fund a reinsurance program first implemented by walker aimed at holding down premiums on the individual health insurance market in the era of obamacare s skyrocketing premiums the budget buttresses the program with 72 2 million gpr and 127 2 in federal dollars for the office of the commissioner of insurance over the two years of the budget the walker administration when rolling out the plan said it would cost taxpayers 34 million gpr annually and would leverage federal dollars to cover the rest of the 200 million dollar tab the reinsurance program was all but forced on walker and republican lawmakers in the wake of rapidly increasing premiums on the individual health insurance market headed into 2018 premiums were expected to spike by 36 percent while 75 000 wisconsinites were expected to lose coverage only after the costly reinsurance tourniquet was applied to the state s bleeding market did rates stabilize with an average 4 2 percent weighted average premium decrease in 2019 a signal from both sides of the aisle that obamacare has failed to hold down health insurance rates or bend the cost curve down continuing the costly reinsurance program to prop up wisconsin s individual health insurance market was met with little controversy or debate medicaid expansion two lines in the sand republicans held strong in refusing to expand medicaid which is certain to save taxpayers a fortune down the road by keeping a lid on enrollment in a notoriously expensive and inefficient program one that gobbled up an extra 917 million just to keep pace with current enrollment even without expanding medicaid as in past budgets the health services budget increase was still enormous evers and his liberal allies campaigned on medicaid expansion building his budget on all of the free money that is supposed to come with the commitment evers threatened to veto any budget that did not include his proposal his liberal allies egged him on urging him to outright reject the republican spending plan when it became clear that expansion was a no go republicans responded by drawing a hard line and unequivocally refusing to expand the welfare program expansion republicans argued would be costly to the private insurance market pushing up premiums and limiting access and affordability it also would expand welfare at a time of unprecedented economic growth besides republican lawmakers argued their budget substantially increases health care and medical assistance funding without tying around wisconsin s neck the albatross of a debt ridden federal government that has failed to keep funding promises to states once jfc pulled out the medicaid expansion even democrats acknowledged evers budget would collapse under its own weight this budget is so tightly wound around that string of medicaid expansion that if you pull that string the whole budget unravels state sen jon erpenbach d middleton told his republican colleagues on the finance committee erpenbach called the medicaid expansion the motherlode of strings that you can pull republicans pulled it as one of their first actions on the budget giving taxpayers and fiscal conservatives a big budget victory medicaid expansion has been a costly proposition for states that have accepted it medicaid spending in ohio for example skyrocketed 35 percent in four years from 18 9 billion to 25 7 billion between fiscal year 2013 and 2017 in arizona costly visits to the emergency room have jumped more than 300 percent and providers have shifted an additional 700 million in costs onto private plans after the medicaid expansion in rhode island medicaid enrollment ballooned 63 percent and state spending on the program has increased 25 percent since expansion forcing the state to consider a new payroll tax on employers these are just a few examples of why republicans fought so hard to keep medicaid expansion out of the budget one more the program has already ballooned in wisconsin more than 1 1 million or about 1 in 5 wisconsinites are on medicaid or related programs today and while unemployment is at record lows ma rolls have increased significantly over the years in 2019 just 2 6 workers support every one ma recipient in 1998 wisconsin had 7 2 workers for every ma recipient throughout the debate democrats alleged that the medicaid expansion population of some 82 000 people has no access to affordable coverage and that only through a government run program could they find affordable coverage republicans pointed out that that claim is untrue there are already affordable health insurance plans available on the private market made affordable thanks to generous subsidies bankrolled by taxpayers via obamacare in fact nygren pointed to one private plan in brown county costing as low as 18 cents per month with a 50 deductible other plans are available around the state for just a few dollars a month ultimately the gop budget pumps more money into a broken system and opts against pursuing innovative new options in health care like direct primary care or dental therapy a separate direct primary care bill is currently making its way through the legislature but unlike a previous version of the bill this one omits a medicaid direct primary care pilot program that could grow into huge taxpayer savings in the future evers and the legislature both made medicaid expansion their line in the sand but when the liberal governor saw all the money jfc dumped into ma the governor seemingly made peace with the idea of letting go of his top campaign promise at least for now the republican budget is merely a down payment on his people s budget vision of spending in the future the governor said when he signed the budget into law in the end he couldn t say no to the large influx of cash the gop budget offered up that new money for dhs comes with little to no reform which is a shame full analysis welfare reform reforming government benefits programs has been a wisconsin hallmark for decades dating back to the administration of gov tommy thompson more recently walker built on the welfare reforms of the 1990s with his own slate of policy changes with a pair of vetoes evers tries to roll some of that legacy back the goal of welfare reform has always been to make sure recipients of taxpayer funded benefits knew the help wasn t free something would be expected of them in return that s an especially reasonable expectation today considering our state s robust economy and roaring job market evers 2019 21 initial budget proposal rolled back much of that progress and attempted to reinstate the notion of a free lunch bankrolled by the hard working taxpayers of wisconsin evers would have struck increased work requirements for medicaid eligibility nominal premiums and co pays for medicaid recipients eliminated a requirement that medicaid recipients be in compliance with child support orders repealed all drug screening requirements and eliminated work requirements for able bodied adults with school aged dependents ages six to 18 as we note below only two of those proposals survived after joint finance made quick work of the liberal wish list budget as legislative republicans described it medicaid expansion was certainly the crown jewel of evers efforts to expand welfare in his budget proposal while democrats throughout the process painted the expansion as an effort to provide health care to a population they claimed had no access to affordable care republicans pushed back by accurately stating what the proposal did expand welfare after joint finance republicans voted to strip the medicaid expansion from evers budget the entire proposal unraveled gov evers budget started and ended with medicaid his budget ended the day republicans took that expansion out said sen erpenbach and so ended the single largest push for welfare expansion in the evers budget but with the stroke of his veto pen months later the governor was able to strike a blow for big government when he vetoed two requirements for those seeking food stamps also known as foodshare evers vetoed a work requirement for able bodied adults with school aged dependents who receive foodshare the requirement part of walker s wisconsin works for everyone welfare reform initiative sought to expand on the success of work requirements for able bodied adults without dependents he also removed drug testing for foodshare recipients who are able bodied adults with no dependents a measure intended to help move people from drug addiction and government dependence into the workforce evers picks a strange time in wisconsin history to reject reforms that put the onus on welfare recipients to at least try to find work our state s unemployment rate stands at a near record low of 3 percent there are more than 100 000 jobs left unfilled and employers everywhere are desperate for help and the walker era work requirements have been successful the largest job training program in the state is the foodshare employment training fset program fset participants earned an average 13 64 per hour nearly double the state minimum wage according to the most recent data available almost 31 000 fset participants have gained employment since the state began tracking data in 2015 simply put there is no excuse for an able bodied adult who is capable of working to sit on the sidelines yet evers budget makes it a whole lot easier to do just that because of his partial vetoes he s starving programs that incentivize work undermining their implementation and skirting the law we know people support drug testing and work requirements for welfare recipients and this budget ignores that fact said assembly speaker robin vos with his vetoes evers chips away at the notion that while taxpayers are generous they expect at least a nominal effort in return for their hard earned dollars and he does so at a time of unprecedented opportunity in the private sector in wisconsin full analysis uw system the uw system will see a 58 million increase in funding over the biennium plus a continuation of the popular tuition freeze for in state undergrads the capital budget also includes 1 billion for building projects across the state yet following the jfc s vote uw system president ray cross said that he felt kicked in the shins not a bad swan song for the budget busting spending at hand system administrators will have to first come back to jfc with a plan for how to spend 45 million of the new spending already baked into the budget are 2 percent raises in each year of the biennium for system employees but it wasn t nearly enough for committee democrats who insisted the system needed more than twice that amount proposing the 126 6 million spending increase that evers offered in his massive 84 2 billion biennial budget plan that dollar amount was an even bigger figure that the system had asked for and included 50 million to backfill tuition revenue lost from the tuition freeze evers plan noted that the funds may be used as the system sees fit including to help struggling campuses or academic programs that sounds a lot like the uw s slush fund of hefty program revenue balances a pot of money that legislators in the state s cpa caucus discovered in 2013 the slush fund totaled over 1 billion leading lawmakers to question why the uw continued raising tuition and asking for more funds when they had tucked away such sizable surplus balances the sentiment was summed up by then rep steve nass r whitewater who stated that more than 2 3 of this surplus was generated by unjustified tuition increases over the last three years in other words president reilly and the board of regents knowingly jacked up tuition by 16 5 percent on wisconsin families over three years even though the funds weren t needed these actions are nothing short of a betrayal of the public trust the slush fund became the main impetus behind walker s tuition freeze and other program cuts the system is now required to regularly report those figures and justify any large increases since 2013 the system s program revenue pr balances have increased at the close of the 2018 fiscal year total pr balances for the system stood at 1 3 billion an 11 6 percent increase from 2014 however a much larger proportion of the fund is restricted compared to 2013 jfc member sen howard marklein r spring green a member of the legislature s cpa caucus reflected on the 2013 discovery at the time the former uw system president was coming in talking about we re broke meanwhile looking at the audit reports and data and there s 1 2 billion sitting there sen howard marklein r spring green recalled in its agency budget request uw system didn t ask for money to backfill tuition revenue since that funding came in higher than expected this year documents from a uw regents meeting show that for fiscal year 2018 the system will have 300 8 million in tuition balances that s 38 percent more than estimated in the 2017 18 operating budget which predicted a 217 8 million balance during the budget vote committee republicans also rejected a dem omnibus package that included 45 million for student success and attainment 10 million to hire more nursing program educators to deal with the state s nursing shortage and another 5 million for student advising as the nonpartisan legislative fiscal bureau noted the system could use the 45 million approved in the block grant style appropriation to fund all or portions of evers initiatives as for building projects republicans accepted 95 percent of evers spending recommendations the uw system will receive more than 1 billion in new spending for multi million dollar projects across the state the largest of these is a chemistry building at uw milwaukee totaling 130 million uw madison will see a veterinary medicine addition and renovation for 128 million as well as a gymnasium replacement for 126 million another 176 million is spread system wide for various utility improvements facility renewal and classroom renovations the new money comes as uw struggles with enrollment that has slowly declined since a peak in 2010 for fall 2018 north of 161 000 students are enrolled in uw system schools including those who attend part time the four year graduation rate for students who graduated in 2017 the most recent figure available was just 38 1 percent as low as it is that s an improvement from students who graduated in 2011 when the four year graduation rate was 28 7 percent the low graduation rate may be related to significant issues with remedial education as we wrote in the k 12 section above thousands of new uw students are required to take remedial math and english every year based on their performance on placement exams those come at the steep cost of full tuition but zero credit unfortunately this budget does little to address that issue along with many others which brings us to our next section full analysis problems and missed opportunities on issues from k 12 education medicaid higher education welfare reform to the capital budget legislators enacted few reforms to go along with the billions more in new spending they provided one possible reason for this missed opportunity evers has the most powerful line item veto in the country the majority of the few reforms contained in this budget were predictably vetoed out by the governor nevertheless it s crucial that both sides fight for their beliefs and make their positions known taxpayers deserve an honest and genuine debate about the direction of our great state if the capital building program is clearly broken what s the harm in proposing a groundbreaking new strategy to fix it debating an idea in public is always better than agreeing to compromise behind closed doors why didn t we have a debate about the needed reform of mps why didn t we have a debate about the remedial education crisis and the fact that hundreds of wisconsin high schools send thousands of students to the uw system unprepared to pass basic english and math tests why didn t we have a debate about the need to empower parents to choose a school that s right for their children why didn t we have a debate about the size scope and cost of state government there s no way around it this budget spends a lot of money with virtually no strings attached no attempt at reforming broken and inefficient government programs and no attempt at eliminating antiquated or redundant government services there are plenty of missed opportunities when evers released his budget plan in late february republicans slammed the new governor for spending far more than the state could afford yet in the end republicans backtracked on the fiscal austerity rhetoric and in many cases ended up spending a lot more than what was necessary with little attempt at attaching accountability measures to that spending this budget simply pours more money into the big government abyss evers had proposed increasing total government jobs by 701 full time positions over the biennium that would have brought the total number of all funds state positions to 71 990 57 in 2020 jfc s plan increased total positions by 482 up to 71 771 59 by 2020 that s still a sizable increase plus this budget gives all state employees 2 percent raises in each year of the biennium and by constantly adding to state rolls those types of increases will only be more expensive in the future in what can only be called a great disappointment for taxpayers legislative republicans tried to keep up with the liberals when it came to government largess in some cases they even outdid evers original spending proposals prison guards personal care workers nursing homes and family care direct care workers get considerably more funding than evers requested was all that new spending truly necessary will the money be spent wisely does government need 482 new positions being that the size and scope of government was hardly up for debate only how much bigger to make it we never really had that discussion that s a missed opportunity taxpayers should also question the wisdom of pumping 655 4 million more gpr into the status quo educational system that fails too many children and is experiencing flat enrollment in this biennium state support to k 12 schools will reach more than 14 billion and dpi s total budget spends north of 15 2 billion evers had proposed a 1 6 billion increase for the agency he headed until january including more than 600 million to increase special education categorical aids the final budget sends 330 million more into the equalization aid formula and 97 million more for special education categorical aids along with a litany of other changes lost in this debate is the fact that wisconsin s k 12 population has stayed relatively flat for many years if we are not experiencing a huge influx of new elementary kids to educate why do our schools need 600 million in new funds and this 600 million increase is on top of the 600 million increase included in the 2017 2019 state budget over a billion dollars in new funding to educate the same number of kids are we seeing any noticeable return on our increased investment again lawmakers failed to have that debate this time around also going virtually un mentioned is the fact that more and more families are choosing other educational choices outside of the public education system choice charter and home schooling are all growing in popularity that s no surprise given that statewide english proficiency sits at just 44 percent and math proficiency at 41 percent yet this budget does nothing with school choice the k 12 educational system has continually failed many wisconsin students with thousands of new uw freshmen requiring remedial math or english those classes come with zero credit and the cost of full tuition putting students behind before they even begin plus many of these are students who were told they were doing well in school more than half of wisconsin s five star high schools sent more than 1 000 students who needed math remediation to uw that s a problem for the uw institutions that need to offer remedial classes it s a problem for parents and students footing the bill and it s especially a problem for the high schools who clearly are leaving a lot of work undone when they graduate oftentimes unprepared students it s yet another problem that was not discussed during the budget debate and when just 54 percent of our public education dollars reach the classroom we must ask how hundreds of millions of dollars will improve student achievement for their part legislative republicans acknowledged the system is broken but they didn t take the opportunity to couple a significant funding increase with required better outcomes and meaningful systematic reform the same can be said for the uw system and the millions more it received compared to the last budget like the k 12 system enrollment at uw has slowly fallen over the years with a strong economy and record low unemployment young people now know that the math has changed it s no longer a given that taking on tens of thousands of dollars in student debt will pay off in the long run and enrollment trends reflect that still the capital budget approves over 1 billion in new funding for building projects across the uw system numerous campuses like uw eau claire and uw milwaukee will get brand new buildings and every campus will see millions more in improvement projects after all these new buildings are completed will the uw system finally stop insisting it is impoverished and in shambles before the jfc vote on the capital budget nygren spoke passionately on how broken the system is he lamented that taxpayers pay uw lobbyists that then lobby the state for more money he also lambasted the fact that uw officials are the drivers of new projects setting rates and budgets for new buildings knowing that the legislature usually just goes along with the plan nygren is exactly right on this but he and every other jfc republican voted for the package it s refreshing to see legislators make strong arguments at the table but it d be more refreshing if they would actually pass the reforms they say they want the health care debate brought a similar tone republicans held strong in refusing to expand medicaid but they instead agreed to send 1 6 billion in all funds to dhs of that increase 917 million all funds is the cost to continue price tag for the state s massive medical assistance programs rather than pursuing innovative reforms in taxpayer provided health care programs like direct primary care self funded association health plans limited duration health plans and dental therapy jfc pumped more money into the medicaid system they acknowledge is broken like so many other parts of the state budget the new incredibly generous funding for dhs came with little to no reforms attached for taxpayers this is frustrating and a huge missed opportunity to make wisconsin a better place to live too many politicians are content just throwing more money at these programs without addressing the fundamental causes of the problems and without making needed reforms to these programs full analysis fiscal policy taxes and spending overview as we ve written above this is a budget that knows how to spend when evers released his budget plan in late february republicans slammed the new governor for spending far more than the state could afford yet in the end republicans backtracked on the fiscal austerity rhetoric and in many cases ended up spending a lot more than what was necessary at times the budget writing process felt like a fiscal arms race with republicans pumping double triple the amount of funding into this program or that agency don t take our word for it some republicans actually bragged about how much more spending they handed out in the end though the party that controls the purse strings just couldn t keep up with a liberal politician who has had the word no surgically removed from his vocabulary at least when it comes to grow government funding requests at a grand total of 83 58 billion the republicans budget is undoubtedly hefty but it still weighs in at about 2 6 billion less than evers morbidly obese 86 2 billion biennial budget plan that s before evers 78 vetoes however we ll have final numbers once the nonpartisan lfb releases its comparative summary of the document for all of the spending conservatives knew they needed to pack a powerful tax cut into the document in order to have enough republican votes in the senate to pass the budget to evers desk and they did wisconsin has long been a high tax state in the most recent tax foundation ranking of states with the highest and lowest state and local taxpayer burdens wisconsin checks in at sixth highest when gov scott walker served as wisconsin s chief executive republicans cut taxes by more than 8 billion that gives you an idea of how bad the badger state s taxing situation is the republicans latest two year budget continues the tax cutting tradition conservatives came up with a 500 million plus tax cut bringing 91 in average income tax relief in the first year and 124 in the second those earning between 30 000 and 60 000 will see the biggest benefit this is achieved with cuts to the bottom two of four individual income tax rates the second income tax bracket currently at 5 84 percent will fall to 4 93 percent in 2020 the bottom most bracket will fall from 4 0 percent to 3 76 percent in 2020 under the final package the average tax filer will see more than 200 in tax relief in the next two years with the bulk of the tax relief coming through income tax rate reductions evers proposed a bigger middle income tax relief package but he would have gotten there by raising taxes on manufacturers and retirees raising taxes on anyone or any group so the government can hand out a small credit to a select few is morally wrong it is divisive politics at its worst the only way wisconsin will ever drop in the highest taxed rankings is if we continue to cut tax rates for everyone not create new credits for some republicans spend a lot more in their budget but they also continue a winning tradition of returning tax dollars to the hard working people who pay the state s bills some tax increases were included in the package including an excise tax of 5 cents per milliliter on vapor products used for e cigarettes evers had proposed extending cigarette taxes to vaping products which would have raised 36 4 million instead republicans raised 5 5 million in taxes on the increasingly popular products the major question for taxpayer lies in the future will republicans stand up to future tax increase ideas from evers with the 2019 21 budget behind us it s hard to say they didn t exactly make a strong stand for fiscal conservatism this time around for all of our sakes let s hope the economy keeps booming so when the 1 4 billion structural deficit comes to roost in 2021 the legislature isn t tempted to increase taxes to fill the gap
the world trade organisation is run as an oligarchy of the developed countries which do not even bother to pretend to be democratic the excluded and abused underdeveloped countries could force a change or even the end of the world s free trade order as we have come to know it this would be a blessing to the world s poor who have been further impoverished since the end of protected economies in the early 1980s free traders have achieved crucial victories in the past 20 years since the debt crisis in 1982 and the resulting imf world bank structural adjustment programmes many developing countries have radically liberalised their trade the collapse of communism in 1991 opened up a vast area of the world to free trade during the 1990s a number of important regional agreements such as the north america free trade agreement nafta were signed and in 1995 the conclusion of the uruguay round talks of the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt led to the birth of the world trade organisation wto the wto is not yet a full blown free trade agreement as it still allows some tariffs but it has shifted the world towards free trade by reducing tariffs and banning trade related subsidies however impressive these achievements the free traders mostly developed countries are not content in the wto they exert continuous pressure to reduce tariffs even further and faster than agreed and to expand its jurisdiction into areas that were not in the original mandate such as foreign investment and competition law in terms of regional agreement there is a strong push to create an area that will cover almost all the western hemisphere the free trade area of the americas ftaa in pushing for further liberalisation the free traders believe that history is on their side they argue that free trade is how all developed countries have become rich and criticise the developing countries for refusing to adopt this successful formula for economic development this is far from the truth when they were developing countries those countries now developed followed few of the policies they now recommend to others and especially free trade and nowhere is this discrepancy between historical reality and myth greater than in britain and the united states the two countries supposed to have reached the summit of the world economy through free markets and free trade britain

better traction more support from the government and central bank are expected the risks are still biased to the downside and the trade tensions may be at a lull as talks resume but progress remains

other reports indicate that china may sanction some us companies if the us goes forward with the 2 bln weapons package to taiwan the financial times provided two pieces of insight into developments in hong kong where protests continued over the weekend first chief executive lam reportedly has offered her resignation several times but beijing has refused it second and related is that the situation

weekend range europe tomorrow the eu parliament will vote on the von der leyen s nomination as the next european commission president to replace juncker she needs a simple majority which is the support of 374 mps the leftists and green s are not supporting her the ostensible reasons are that she is a compromise candidate and was not discussed before the vote and her agenda is not sufficiently ambitious the social democrats and liberals have demanded additional commitments and the interest in the rule of law in this context is about confronting the illiberal actions in hungary

15 07 2019 geopolitics and the asian infrastructure investment bank jose miguel alonso trabanco in june 2015 the creation of the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib was agreed to by representatives of 50 countries in beijing china the bank started operating in january 2016 and its first four loans totaling usd 509 million were approved for bangladesh indonesia pakistan and tajikistan moreover a location in beijing was chosen as the headquarters of this new multilateral banking organization the aiib started with an initial capital of usd 100 billion in order to keep things in perspective the sum is roughly equivalent to ecuador s gdp so far it has approved projects related to hydropower energy motorways tourism dams pipelines and ports amongst others this venture has captured considerable interest for instance some economists foresee the aiib becoming a formidable competitor of the world bank and the international monetary fund entities established within the framework of the bretton woods system during the aftermath of world war two and whose governance has been historically controlled by atlanticist powers ever since in fact this reality still persists in the early 21st century however that is hardly surprising if one considers that more often than not intergovernmental institutions reflect the interests of their creators on the other hand the impressive list of full members includes a diverse myriad of states from europe central asia the middle east the asia pacific region the former soviet union and even from the americas this list includes great powers offshore financial centers and interestingly nato members and other us allies hence the aiib represents the most ambitious formal multilateral initiative sponsored by china its membership is even wider than that of the shanghai cooperation organization sco an institution conceived to encourage a closer strategic military and economic collaboration amongst china russia and four central asian republics even though the aiib is of course an economic and financial institution its reach and nature must also be analyzed from a perspective of grand strategy actually it can be argued that well beyond the technical realm of business and mercantile concerns the aiib responds to china s goal of developing finance as a tool to advance its interests on the global geopolitical chessboard according to this multidimensional interpretation the aiib pursues five parallel objectives undermining american plans to establish a political and commercial cordon sanitaire around china the mammoth territorial and demographic proportions of the asian juggernaut as well as the size of its economy a 2017 gdp of more than 12 trillion dollars which makes it the world s second largest in combination with its rising techno industrial and military power means that china represents a formidable candidate to become the center of gravity in the asia pacific region and perhaps beyond accordingly the us intelligence community is fully aware that if china continues its uninterrupted economic ascent it could evolve into a colossal power whose magnetic influence becomes its own new agglutinating pole therefore the containment of china is a natural geopolitical imperative for us foreign policy and consequently it is reasonable to forecast that the united states intends to use both military and commercial measures to place a cordon sanitaire able to constrain it in the military realm washington intends to encircle china either indirectly through us allies in the asia pacific region australia south korea japan and new zealand and directly through the nearby presence of us military facilities hardware and personnel in locations like afghanistan south korea the philippines guam singapore diego garcia etc likewise there is the implicit threat of using us naval expeditionary warfare capabilities to interrupt the seaborne flow of chinese exports as well as to disrupt chinese imports of raw materials which are shipped across oceanic waterways concerning the mercantile battlefield even though the plan was ultimately abandoned by the trump administration the americans had pursued the creation of a multilateral trade bloc the trans pacific partnership that would have served to keep in check the people s republic of china s international commercial reach otherwise it was hard to understand from a purely economic perspective the exclusion of the planet s second largest economy from a framework nominally designed to fuel trade in the pacific basin thus one way or another beijing needs to resort to pro active conventional military and unconventional trade finance energy measures in order to halt the progress of both us containment schemes because they represent an evident threat to its national interests even though one of these plans was eventually discarded by the u s the increasingly confrontational stance washington has assumed toward china in the field of trade makes it unwise to overlook the pertinence of possible countermeasures so the plan to employ its financial strengths to pre emptively override the abovementioned constrictions through the creation of regional bank spearheaded by china itself represents a feasible asymmetric choice which is both clever and convenient especially if it generates enough substantial incentives to seduce even washington s traditional allies seen from china s angle the aiib represents a gateway to a closer business relationship with an attractive market one which entails deeper strategic implications of course many states calculated that the prospects of promising investment flows were attractive enough regardless of what washington had to say about it in other words the cost benefit analysis revealed a favorable balance projecting chinese national power in the realm of finance china is the world s second largest economy in terms of nominal gdp its gdp more than 12 trillion dollars is only behind that of the us interestingly the chinese economy is superior to the sum of japan plus germany the world s third and fourth largest economies respectively furthermore beijing s foreign currency reserves have reached the stratospheric sum of 3 217 trillion dollars china occupies the first position in this ranking whereas japan is a distant second place with 1 267 trillion dollars nevertheless china s economic and financial power is still not reflected in the main corresponding intergovernmental frameworks china s influence within the international monetary fund imf does not proportionally correlate to the specific weight of its economy and apparently reforms to readjust such asymmetry have been in the best case scenario notoriously slow even though some recent steps have been favorably received in beijing such as the inclusion of the yuan in the basket of currencies used by the imf additionally china does not ignore the strategic implications of the fact that the multilateral institutions emanated from the bretton woods system are the result of a consensus generated among the main members of the transatlantic alliance in the context of the allied victory in world war two and the subsequent us leadership of the western bloc during the cold war as exerted in the military geopolitical economic and financial fields hence from the chinese viewpoint it is not far fetched to assume that the aforementioned organizations still privilege the interests of their original creators after all the world bank has always been presided over by americans whereas the international monetary fund has invariably been headed by europeans the geography speaks even more eloquently both the wb and the imf are headquartered in washington d c on the other hand there is a precedent that has to be taken into consideration for this analysis dominique strauss kahn a former imf managing director who during his tenure had promoted a more active role for china within the activities of the institution was removed from office in 2011 under unclear circumstances this case could not have gone unnoticed for beijing s strategic circles as a result it is reasonable for the people s republic of china to place itself as the cornerstone of a multilateral bank headquartered in the chinese capital in order to assume a more assertive leadership in the financial realm last but not least prestige also plays a role in international political economy hence the aiib represents a visible sign of china s rising economic and financial might i e it denotes its wealth and prosperity in this context it is important to keep in mind deng xiaoping s most famous remarks it is glorious to be rich funding the reconstruction of the silk road in order to deepen trade links amongst eurasia s main economies eurasian mercantile connectedness is not a new phenomenon since the time of the roman empire until approximately the 15th century the so called silk road was a commercial corridor which used to link western europe to the pacific rim through the exchange of many products back then trade undertaken by intrepid merchants fueled financial innovations which facilitated economic activity this linkage also stimulated the circulation of religions cultural ideas and technological advances from the iberian peninsula to the south china sea officially the aiib s raison d être is focus on development of infrastructure and other productive sectors in asia including energy and power transportation and telecommunications rural infrastructure and agricultural development water supply and sanitation environmental protection urban development and logistics etc in this context the development of trade logistical infrastructure especially terrestrial can be regarded as a catalyst to foster integration between china and the main economies of regions such as western europe the post soviet space and the middle east in order to diminish the dependence of chinese exporters on the us consumer market through diversification of trade partnerships it must be noted that the us absorbs around 19 of chinese exports moreover from a strategic viewpoint the chinese project to rekindle the legendary silk road serves beijing s national interests by reducing the direct exposure of its trade flows to american sea power seeking a deeper pan eurasian mercantile interconnection would enable the convergence of geopolitics economic financial and energy interests across the eurasian landmass the materialization of these plans would necessarily require the collaboration of the russian federation based on its crucial geographic position at the heartland that connects europe with asia and also on moscow s role as a growing diplomatic ally energy supplier provider of military hardware and trade partner of china indeed there is ample evidence of beijing s mercantile penetration into eurasia s strategic regions the commercial railroad which links madrid the spanish capital with the chinese town of yiwu is already operational since december 2015 in fact it is an enlargement of the yu xinóu railroad which connects the chinese city of chongqing with the german city of duisburg both of which are important industrial centers the chinese are building a massive industrial park in belarus the great stone project which will also harbor commercial logistics infrastructure a financial center business platforms research and development facilities as well as residential units in july 2015 china and israel signed an agreement intended to increase by a margin of 500 million dollars the line of credit to fund israeli exports to the chinese market beijing and jerusalem are also currently negotiating a free trade agreement the fact that chinese companies will manage israeli ports namely haifa ashdod and eilat is also noteworthy beijing and moscow have reached a consensus about the supply of russian natural gas to china through two pipelines called altai and the power of siberia in light of the above it is accurate to hold that the aiib could bankroll profitable business projects that ultimately respond to beijing s geopolitical interests thus the synergy between the aiib and the new silk road project has been described as an ambitious plan that represents the chinese equivalent of the marshall plan fragmenting the us global alliance system beijing is using the bait of economic incentives in order to fragment the us global system of alliances after all the handsome profits associated with investment in infrastructure projects in an increasingly dynamic region in terms of economic growth are tempting to say the least it is important to note that the united kingdom was the first european country to have joined the aiib as a prospective founding member followed by germany france and italy all of them nato members which revealed the scant importance those governments attached to the need of crafting a common transatlantic position previously negotiated with washington in order to define a unified course of action towards this chinese project knowing that the rise of chinese power in asia and elsewhere is a major concern for us interests therefore as was to be expected the united states unsuccessfully attempted to prevent its allies from joining the aiib questioning its governance and invoking an alleged concern about environmental and human rights matters seen from a geopolitical perspective it is feasible to envisage the aiib as a tool designed by china not only to increase its influence through support for economic growth but also as part of a plan orchestrated to encourage both allies and rivals of us power to maneuver into a strategic rebalancing to simultaneously move away from washington and into beijing s embracing arms even though the list of traditional us allies who have decided to join the aiib is telling the case of great britain is especially remarkable because of the common denominators in terms of cultural heritage language history as well as the close military intelligence and geopolitical collaboration between the two most prominent members of the anglosphere moreover it is also outstanding because the city located in downtown london is one of the world s largest and most prestigious financial nerve centers in some respects like currency trade it is even more important than wall street the aforementioned reflects that joining the bank entails deep strategic ramifications that go well beyond the fields of trade business and finance and of course it is likely that was precisely the intent of the aiib s chinese architects from the very beginning they wanted to redraw a balance of power more favorable for beijing s geopolitical interests setting up a platform whose contribution will be instrumental in challenging the us dollar s monetary hegemony according to the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication by february 2019 the chinese yuan had become based on value of domestic and international payments the fifth most widely used currency for global transactions reaching a proportion of 2 15 of the total behind the dollar the euro the pound sterling and the japanese yen this would indicate that it has already surpassed traditionally strong currencies like the canadian and australian dollars indeed available evidence supports the progressive expansion of the chinese currency s financial lebensraum in this context the following developments must be taken into account the emission of bonds by the uk royal treasury denominated in yuan which started being traded back in october 2014 the signing in january 2015 of an agreement between the central banks of china and switzerland for the establishment of a financial platform in zurich to carry out financial operations denominated in renminbi from january 2015 onwards gazprom neft the russian federation s third largest oil producer has priced in yuan its oil sales contacts with china which are being supplied through the eastern siberia pacific ocean oil pipeline in december 2015 the imf s executive board decided to include the chinese currency in the special drawing rights sdr basket whose value since 1999 had been based on the us dollar the euro the japanese yen and the british pound this decision was officially explained as a result of the renminbi s status as a freely usable currency in other words one whose importance is considerable for both international trade and global finance the launch in april 2016 of a benchmark for the exchange of gold which is denominated exclusively in yuan and operated by the shanghai gold exchange participants include mining banking and jewelry companies although these are telling signs of the growing internationalization of the chinese yuan its evolutionary trajectory still has a long way to go in order to reach a dominant position amongst the main reserve currencies one of those crucial steps will be its full convertibility in other words it still lacks a critical mass to challenge the us dollar but its international competitiveness and attractiveness are becoming stronger actually the largest chinese investment bank china international capital corp cicc had forecasted the renminbi s convertibility by the end of 2015 however faced with recent significant financial turmoil the ruling chinese communist party is reportedly planning to achieve the full convertibility of the yuan by 2020 moreover the imf now regards the yuan as a reserve currency its corresponding proportion 1 79 of the world s composition of official allocated foreign exchange reserves is still modest but it s likely to grow over the long term therefore the increasing projection of the chinese renminbi must be analyzed in terms of high strategy especially considering that the use of financial tools as weapons of war as well as their destructive potential and the degree of secrecy with which financial warfare can be carried out have been seriously studied by the chinese military since at least 1999 as a form of semi warfare quasi warfare or sub warfare i e an atypical conduit for offensive power projection that intends to strike enemy countries and defeat them by unleashing incapacitating havoc rather than through classical direct kinetic attacks consequently even though the chinese yuan still does not look like a direct challenger of the us dollar beijing knows its huge foreign currency reserves enables it to threaten the dollar s current hegemonic position furthermore it is important to highlight the prospective rise of a geo financial alliance between beijing and moscow which could seek the establishment of a financial order parallel to the us dollar s monetary hegemony in order to counter the power wielded by the us through its control of the global financial order in fact the official chinese news agency xinhua pointed out that designing financing tools that are complementary to the current international financial system china has no intention of knocking over the chessboard but rather is trying to help shape a more diverse world playing board china welcomes cooperation from every corner of the world to achieve shared prosperity based on common interest but will go ahead anyway when it believes it is in the right indeed it is imperative to bear in mind the importance of the yuan in order to assess the aiib s future evolution considering that the chinese have been seemingly promoting a role for the renminbi in the loans to be granted by the aiib according to some media reports chinese think tanks believe one of the goals should be to challenge the greenback s dominant position in global finance lessons learned the case of the aiib reveals that great powers are increasingly resorting to the realm of finance not just to enhance their economic wealth but also as part of an ambitious quest to find vectors that can help them advance their national geopolitical interests and to simultaneously undermine those of their rivals therefore it is clear that strategic maneuvers that combine geopolitical and financial elements including of course the instrumental employment of multilateral banking institutions are here to stay as tools for power projection in an unconventional and increasingly complex operational theatre in which incompatible interests clash accordingly the international financial system is doomed to become an increasingly confrontational arena in terms of high strategy so an intensification of moves and countermoves is more than reasonably foreseeable in this peculiar chessboard needless to say this goes well beyond the traditional parameters of economic competition in this context the instrumental control of institutional frameworks that play a prominent role in international financial governance will be an increasingly critical factor whose strategic importance might reshape the global balance of power in the 21st century perhaps not surprisingly high finance and geopolitical grand strategy are converging more than ever before

credit crisis and that has been another reason for the fall in trading revenue thus mr madden said the big banks have been trying to bolster results via less risky business such as fees from investing banking meters and acquisitions wealth management and in some cases retail banking the fact that some u s indices have reached all time highs on a few occasions in the past year should have helped the banks wealth management units as well as their m a teams mr madden said speculation the u s federal reserve is going to cut interest rates later this year has driven down u s government bond yields and that is likely to compress the net lending margin rate so those banks that have retail banking units are likely to earns less from lending read more required reading chevron seeks to revive lng

china s economy slowed to the weakest pace since quarterly data began in 1992 amid the ongoing trade standoff with the u s while monthly indicators provided signs that a stabilization is emerging gross domestic product rose 6 2 per cent in the april june period from a year earlier below the 6 4 per cent expansion in the first quarter in june factory output and retail sales growth beat estimates while investment in the first half of the year also gave further evidence that stimulus measures to curb the slowdown are feeding through equity gauges in shanghai and hong kong recouped early losses after the better than expected activity data the offshore yuan was little changed the slowdown underlines the pressure that chinese policy makers face as they attempt to negotiate a deal with the u s on trade while the economy takes another step down in the long term deceleration from the heady expansion of the mid 2000s although chinese negotiators are talking with u s counterparts again there is no certainty that a deal will be reached in time to prevent further economic damage we continue to see the second quarter growth slowing but i think we are seeing the stabilization wang tao chief china economist at ubs ag in hong kong said in an interview with bloomberg tv the central bank needs to be a bit more proactive going forward with additional reserve requirement ratio reductions if higher tariffs come in she said net exports contributed to 20 7 per cent to output growth in the first half down from 22 8 per cent in the first quarter trade data released friday in beijing detailed the weak end to the second quarter as exports and imports fell the surveyed urban jobless rate ticked up to 5 1 per cent from 5 0 per cent china s 2nd quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for non tariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving this is why china wants to make a deal donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 15 2019 with the u s and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing pumping not by the u s taxpayer donald j trump realdonaldtrump july 15 2019 what bloomberg s economists say concerns over global growth slowdown and the persistence of u s china trade war would continue to cloud the economic outlook in the domestic market whether the rebound in retail sales growth is sustainable is still uncertain david qu and qian wan bloomberg economics stronger investment fixed asset investment growth in the first half accelerated at private firms whereas state companies eased back a further sign that government efforts to funnel cash to the private sector may be bearing fruit for the manufacturing sector investment accelerated a notch to three per cent in the first half while infrastructure investment also picked up to 4 1 per cent better than expected retail sales data also lend credence to the idea that stability will emerge in the second half of the year while the data are volatile faster growth in sales of consumer goods household appliances and furniture also point to the modest recovery ongoing in the vital property sector the overall retail sales result was also driven by robust auto sales growth though with heavy discounts attracting buyers in june economists remain cautious on whether that upturn can be sustained a fiscal stimulus plan including about two trillion yuan us 291 billion of tax cuts is slowly feeding through into the economy the government has stepped up efforts recently easing the rules for using government debt in some infrastructure projects and pledging to renovate hundreds of thousands of old buildings we can take comfort in that the expansionary measures by the government are actually working said mary therese barton head of emerging market debt at pictet asset management sa speaking on bloomberg tv so we take a lot of heart in the retail sales data in particular and the strength of domestic consumption property outlook amid concerns about emerging price bubbles and risks in the financial sector officials are likely to keep the recovery in the property market tightly controlled property development investment slowed for a second month in june dragging down the growth of newly started property construction and inventory until now china s leadership is tolerating the continued deceleration in the economy while the official unemployment rate remains low and monetary policy has remained supportive without flooding the financial system with cash further tweaks to cement any nascent stabilization could be announced following a meeting of top leaders this month china s economy in the third quarter may face more downward pressure said larry hu head of china economics at macquarie securities ltd in hong kong there probably won t be any obvious policy adjustment in july but more possibilities of change in the fourth quarter with assistance from tomoko sato and wendy hu
millennium challenge corporation in sri lanka by c a chandraprema courtesy the island the controversy over the involvement of the millennium challenge corporation mcc in sri lanka has now come to a head mcc was created in the early years of the new millennium by the bush administration as an aid distribution programme for developing countries that are inclined to govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom the formation of the new body was in recognition of the fact that the us development assistance programmes which existed at the time had consistently failed to meet their stated goals despite decades of economic aid most recipients are poorer now than they were before first receiving development assistance from 1980 to 2000 the united states had disbursed 167 billion in aid to 156 developing countries but among the 97 countries for which reliable economic data for that period are available median per capita gross domestic product gdp had declined from 1 076 in 1980 to 994 in 2000 the mcc is thus supposed to be an experimental programme that seeks to explore new strategies to improve the effectiveness of development assistance programmes we now have the honour of being one of the guinea pigs testing out the efficacy of the aid programmes of mcc one complicating factor is that the american aid organisation will be investing only usd 480 million in sri lanka in a situation where the government s foreign borrowing through sovereign bonds during the first half of this year alone was usd 4 5 billion with a government that has borrowed not tens of millions but tens of billion of us dollars during a period of three or four years a grant of 480 million is too small even to register on the scale at the time the millennium challenge corporation was created in the early years of this millennium 300 or 400 million usd was considered a colossal amount of money in sri lanka the pledge of a concessionary loan from china of usd 300 million to build the first phase of the norochchcolai power plant during the last years of the chandrika kumaratunga government was welcomed at that time as a major breakthrough since that time much water has flown under the bridge and sri lanka has moved from being a low income country to an upper middle income country and the government that came into power in january 2015 commenced an era of mega foreign borrowings to pay for the election related government expenditure they incurred to win the 2015 august parliamentary election a grant of 480 million usd would have been a significant aid package during the rajapaksa government the present government would borrow 480 million usd in a single afternoon through the issue of sri lanka development bonds according to mcc criteria countries must qualify as low income or lower middle income countries according to the world bank s classification in order to be eligible for mcc grants on the 1st of july this year the world bank classified sri lanka as an upper middle income country with a per capita income in excess of 3 895 however by that time the mcc grant for sri lanka had already been passed and in any event according to mcc criteria when a country s classification changes it wil retain its former classification for a further two years veil of secrecy over mcc project as with everything else the controversy over the mcc project is largely due to the lack of transparency in the doings of the government ironically the mcc in selecting partner countries uses an indicator that measures a country s commitment among other things to the freedom of information yet the very thing that is missing about the agreement that has been entered into by this government and the mcc is information one would think that when the opposition and members of the general public begin to voice misgivings about a deal that the government has struck with some foreign party the first thing any government should do is to immediately launch a programme to explain to the public what the deal is about and how it is supposed to benefit sri lanka the controversy over the mcc has now been at the forefront of political discourse for months but the government has done nothing to enlighten the public the benefits that it is supposed to bestow on sri lanka as of now all that the public knows is that the usa will be giving sri lanka a grant of 480 million to carry out the work involved this grant was the silver lining that finance minister mangala samaraweera mangala saw in the dark cloud that covered sri lanka after the easter sunday bombings all that the public knows about this project is the limited information that is available on the mcc website what the website says is that mcc seeks to assist the sri lanka government in addressing two of the country s binding constraints to economic growth namely inadequate transport logistics infrastructure and planning and lack of access to land for agriculture the services sector and industrial investors the mcc website further states that the transport project aims to increase the relative efficiency and capacity of the road network and bus system in the colombo metropolitan region and to reduce the cost of transporting passengers and goods between the central region of the country and ports and markets in the rest of the country the stated goal of the land project is to increase the availability of information on private land and underutilized state lands or all land in sri lanka to which the government is lawfully entitled or which may be disposed of by the government in order to increase land market activity the mcc land project is supposed increase tenure security and tradability of land for smallholders women and firms through policy and legal reforms the picture that the public has of the transport project is that a road transport corridor is to be set up between the ports of colombo and trincomalee with the americans having an interest in the port of trincomalee neither the government nor the mcc has published anything that would enlighten the public any further even though money has been allocated for this project nobody has seen a proper project description or a diagram of how that effect is to be achieved while the mahaweli project was being built everybody knew what was being built and where if the efficiency and capacity of the road network and bus system in the colombo metropolitan region was to be improved and the cost of transporting passengers and goods between the central region of the country and ports and markets in the rest of the country was to be reduced that would give the government a much needed boost and one would think that they would have turned this into one of their main trumps in their re election bid as well yet the government has been inexplicably secretive about the whole mcc project the government s silence on what exactly is going to be done under this project is what is fuelling speculation and suspicion if it ain t broke why fix it the goal of the land project has been explicitly stated as seeking to increase the availability of information on private land and underutilized state lands or all land in sri lanka to which the government is lawfully entitled or which may be disposed of by the government the aim was to increase land market activity the land project is supposed to increase tenure security and tradability of land for smallholders women and firms the target clearly is state owned land in sri lanka we have freehold properties that belong to individuals or companies and then there is state owned land a portion of which is utilized directly by the government and a portion which remains allocated for other purposes of the republic such as forest reserves and the like and another potion of state land is held by the public under lease or licencing arrangements it is obviously the latter that the mcc is targeting even though such state owned lands have been alienated to individuals under licensing or long term lease arrangements the tenants on these lands enjoy security of tenure because the government will not simply kick them off the land if it is cultivated and used productively the lease holder or lisencee will be adequately compensated before the government takes back a state land which has been given to private individuals for farming or other purposes we almost never hear of even the smallest of smallholders being unreasonably evicted from state owned land that had been leased or given to them on a license by the state furthermore the state owned land given out to individuals can change hands and be sold there is a separate market for leasehold or licenced land holdings with the price being somewhat lower than in the case of freehold land such land can also be passed down from generation to generation provided the land had been utilized productively when the department of rural development and land reform in south africa proposed an overhaul of the country s land holding system what they proposed was that state land be under lease hold and private land be under freehold with limited extent while foreign ownership should be linked to productivity and partnership models with south african citizens that is much like the system that prevails in sri lanka at present if something is not broken why try to mend it admittedly recipients of state owned land on lease will face issues when trying to raise money from banks with the land pledged as surety banks prefer freehold land only the high value customers with a proven track record would stand a chance of being able to raise money by pledgeing a lease on a state owned land as surety in such an environment startups would have little or no chance however one would think that this was a problem that had to be dealt with at the level of the banks instead of trying to give leaseholders freehold tenure if leaseholds on state land can be bought and sold between citizens of sri lanka and their only problem is the inability to use that lease as collateral the answer to that can t be the wholesale transformation of such lands into freehold tenures there is besides the well founded fear that if state owned lands which are at present farmed by individuals on leasehold or lisencing arrangements are turned into freehold properties it will not be long before unscrupulous elements lay their hands on these lands creating a landless rural population the fact that the land is owned by the state discourages fragmentation of the land and strategic buying up of cheap land by organized parties as what happened in palestine before the creation of israel in a country like ours this is a paramount consideration when discussing land policy in this country even a leasehold land has a monetary value which is below the value of a similar freehold property and the banks should be encouraged to lend to leaseholders at least to the extent of the reduced value of the land without turning away leaseholders wholesale when we look at the land rights and access indicator of the mcc we see that the kind of land reform that they have in mind would be applicable to countries in sub saharan africa which don t even have governments worth the name rather than countries like ours the mcc s access to land indicator assesses the extent to which the institutional and legal framework provides secure land tenure and equitable access to land in rural areas they look at the extent to which the law guarantees secure tenure for land rights of the poor the extent to which the law guarantees secure land rights for women and other vulnerable groups the extent to which land is titled and registered etc sri lanka has no major issues with regard to any of those benchmarks the mcc also looks at how long it takes to register property and the time taken to transfer the property title from the seller to the buyer so that the buyer can use the title for expanding business as collateral in taking new loans or if necessary to sell to another business sri lanka does not have any major issues with regard to such matters either the mcc also looks at the cost to register property as a percentage of the value of the property the latter is one area where vast improvement is needed in sri lanka not because of the cost in registering the land per se but in the duties charged by our exploitative government on land transactions which drives up the transaction cost that however is a matter that only the sri lankan government can address the exorbitant duties charged on land transactions goes for the maintenance of the white elephants known as the provincial councils most people doing land transactions would have found that the provincial council does not necessarily accept the cost of the land as stated on the deed but they do a valuation on their own and the tax that has to be paid is calculated on the basis of that estimated value the only genuine problem that sri lankans have with regard to land tenure and other issues is the exploitative attitude of the government which seeks to make a killing off land transactions the mcc states that secure land tenure gives people long term incentives to invest and to use land as collateral for loans sri lanka s rand reform laws enacted in the 1970s was instrumental in fixing a ceiling on land ownership according to the land reform laws no 1 of 1972 and no 39 of 1975 brought by the then slfp government the maximum extent of agricultural land which may be owned by any person was twenty five acres of paddy land and fifty acres of other agricultural land there have been strident calls for the abolition of this ceiling in order to encourage commercial agriculture that too is not something that would require the intervention of a foreign donor organization cloak and dagger development work the mcc which uses an indicator that measures a country s commitment to the freedom of information in order to qualify for a programme has been very reticent with information on what exactly it is doing in sri lanka the mcc freedom of information indicator measures a government s commitment to enable or allow information to move freely in society this indicator is based on the degree of press freedom the status of national freedom of information laws and a measure of internet filtering the mcc website even has a lecture on how information flows relate to growth and poverty reduction the following is what the mcc says about the importance of free information flows governments play a role in information flows they can restrict or facilitate information flows within countries or across borders many of the institutions laws regulations codes of conduct that governments design are created to manage the flow of information in an economy countries with better information flows often have better quality governance and less corruption higher transparency and access to information have been shown to increase investment inflows the mcc uses several indicators to measure a country s eligibility for grants including the freedom of information mentioned earlier among the other indicators are the following ruling justly prevalence of free and fair electoral processes political pluralism and participation of all stakeholders government accountability and transparency freedom from domination by the military foreign powers totalitarian parties religious hierarchies and economic oligarchies and the political rights of minority groups civil liberties freedom of expression and belief association and organizational rights rule of law and human rights and personal autonomy and economic rights government effectiveness the quality of public service provision civil servants competency and independence from political pressures and the government s ability to plan and implement sound policies among other things rule of law the extent to which the public has confidence in and abides by the rules of society the incidence and impact of violent and non violent crime the effectiveness independence and predictability of the judiciary the protection of property rights and the enforceability of contracts control of corruption grand corruption in the political arena the frequency of petty corruption the effects of corruption on the business environment and the tendency of elites to engage in state capture among other things there are also some economic indicators such as the following fiscal policy government borrowing as a percent of the gdp averaged over a three year period inflation the most recent average annual change in consumer prices regulatory quality the burden of regulations on business price controls the government s role in the economy and foreign investment regulation trade policy openness to international trade based on average tariff rates and non tariff barriers to trade land rights and access the institutional legal and market framework to provide secure land tenure and equitable access to land in rural areas and the time and cost of property registration in urban and peri urban areas according to sri lanka s scorecard for 2019 published on the mcc website sri lanka has passed the tests for political rights civil liberties control of corruption government effectiveness and the rule of law sl has failed the tests for the freedom of information which is not surprising given how little information there is about what mcc is doing in sri lanka when it comes to the economic indicators sl has passed the tests for inflation regulatory quality trade policy business start up but failed on fiscal policy land rights and access to credit
when i caught up with the gilets jaunes on march 2 near the jardin du ranelagh they were moving in such a mass through the streets that all traffic had come to a halt the residents of passy one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in paris stood agape and apart and afraid many of the shops and businesses along the route of the march which that day crossed seven and a half miles of the city were shuttered for the occasion the proprietors fearful of the volatile crowd who mostly hailed from outside paris and were considered a rabble of invaders among the marchersâ goals were disrupting business as usual halting commerce spreading disorder and in doing all of these making themselves heard they had been in the streets every saturday since the first gilets jaunes action on november 17 2018 when almost three hundred thousand citizens gathered across france in protest of taxes and fiscal reforms they felt unfairly burdened the poor the working class retirees pensioners and the unemployed on two saturdays in december as the movement escalated they had rallied by the thousands in paris and in an eruption of terrific vandalism caused millions of dollars of property damage in the worldâ s most expensive city on december 1 demonstrators had rampaged through parisâ s luxury districts on the champs â ã lysã es avenue hoche opã ra on the rue de rivoli at place saint augustin and on boulevard haussmann shattering storefront windows looting and setting cars on fire at place vendã me home of world â famous jewelry boutiques the gilets piled up plastic christmas trees and set them aflame declaring that pã re noã l father of consumption had come with a vengeance in the neighborhood around place de lâ ã toile mansions were vandalized and burned these were the redoubts of the despised haute bourgeoisie who lounged in ease while the rest of france languished and riot was the answer to that inequity there had been much violence and much suffering since december and not just in paris citizens in rouen toulouse bordeaux lyon nã mes nantes and nice bombarded cops with hammers ball bearings rocks and cobblestones torn from the streets the more serious among the protesters threw molotov cocktails that set the cops on fire there were pitched battles against the forces de lâ ordre that ended with the demonstrators bloodied and driven back under a wave of truncheons hundreds of properties were ransacked and set on fire with at least 2 200â protesters injured some of them losing eyes jaws hands and feet from the rubber bullets tear gas rounds and dispersal grenades that police officers and gendarmes fired in enormous volumes to scatter the crowds by mid â december the french president emmanuel macron faced with civil unrest exceeding any since the student protests of 1968 declared a state of national emergency â the people allude to the french revolution â a professor of political science at parisâ s sciences po told the new york times â â we have to cut off the head of the king â â now on march 2 the gilets jaunes clothed in their yellow vests the reflective safety gear that motorists in france are required to carry and that had become the groupâ s mark of solidarity streamed along the rue du ranelagh they chanted â paris wake up â and a call â and â response of â are you tired no we are not tired â a few carried the french tricolor the national flag with roots in the revolution of 1789 which they held high on long poles some periodically launched into a bellowing guttural basso rendition of the â marseillaise â as the â gilets did whenever they gathered â listen to the sound in the fields â they sang the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons andâ consorts i was racing to join them when i passed two exquisitely dressed women who stared with worried petulant â faces as they walked their dogs in the park one of them lived on the other side of the rue du

month i arrived in paris â and itâ s not the usual fear of losing an election failing to â reform â or seeing their shares slide on the stock market but fear of insurrection revolt and loss of power â by the spring the gilets jaunes had morphed into a movement that broadly eclipsed their initial intent which was to protest a modest increase in fuel taxes imposed in 2018 by the macron government the new carbon taxâ nine cents more per liter of diesel four cents more per liter of gasolineâ â may have been the proximate cause that galvanized the gilets but the worsening conditions of what the protesters called â lâ injustice fiscaleâ provided the powder for an explosion the context was the governmentâ s widening embrace of the doctrines of neoliberalism a nation decried by its governing elites as creaking slow â growth debt â ridden and unemployment â plaguedâ out of step with the freeâ wheeling global economyâ â was to be liberated at last from the constraints of the social â

international monetary fund demanded of member states for the greater good of capital flow elected in 2017 emmanuel â macronâ â a youthful and imperious former investment banker at rothschild where he

standing tax on assets above 1 5 million replacing it with a more modest property tax that exempted other forms of wealth he reduced government support for university students and for low income housing and he made it easier for businesses to fire employees he pushed for the privatization of highways and railways and airports at the same time he oversaw continuing cuts to public transit public hospitals and public schools along with the closure of maternity wards childcare centers and post offices in already underserved areas primarily in rural semiâ rural and what was called â peri â urbanâ france the struggling belts of development surrounding the more prosperous cities granted macron was simply expanding and accelerating the investor â friendly reforms of his predecessor the centrist socialist francois hollande under whom macron had served as minister of the economy and who had ended his own presidency with a record low approval rating of 4â percent part of what drove the gilets to agitation to the state of what they called ras â le â bolâ a peculiarly french expression of exasperation nearly untranslatable that means something like â the bowl is filledâ â is that the parties of the putative left in recent years appeared indistinguishable from those of the right wherever french voters had turned somehow there was still a neoliberal lording over them in the ã lysã e palace favoring the diktats of the european union the forces of unregulated markets the juggernaut of globalization then came the carbon tax macron implemented it to curb the nationâ s emissions part of his intention â to make our planet great again â his phrasing purposely mocked donald trumpâ s climate â change denialism and in the eyes of the international community it framed macron as a heroic progressive at the vanguard of the most important issue of our time at home however macronâ s tax seemed to place the burden of ecological responsibility on the â classes least able to bear it those in the poorest parts of france outside the big cities who depended more than ever on their cars for transport in places where rail and bus services were disappearing under the regime of austerity and whose village centersâ â not so long ago places of boulangeries boucheries patisseries cafã s brasseries and barsâ had been hollowed out by multinationals and e â commerce meanwhile paris made out fine its exclusivity such that a mere 7â percent of new homeâ owners in the city each year now come from the working class it was not lost on the protesters that the poor and the rich have very different carbon footprints i heard the same complaint from gilets repeatedly â the rich they are the ones taking the airplanes they are the ones consuming more â the wealthiest 10â percent of french citizens emit some seventeen metric tons of carbon per capita according to a 2015 oxfam study while the poorest 50â percent emit less than five in the united states the disparity is even more pronounced with the top 10â percent emitting fifty metric tons per capita and the bottom 50â percent emitting eight the hypocrisy seen to be embedded in the macron carbon tax more than any other factor roused to action the gilets whom i interviewed this fact pointed toward a concrete reality underlying the inchoate passion of the movement which was that if you want to deal with climate change globally you need first to topple the regimes of the rich locally during a march 16 protest along the champs â ã lysã esâ the eighteenth saturday in a row on which the gilets had been at it and a day of extraordinary vandalism eclipsed only by the violence of early decemberâ a gilet named claude josset sixty four years old a factory mechanic from the suburbs of paris who oversaw the production of concrete wore a smile on his face as he explained that â the rich have a problem before them now â his fellow protesters in one of the many melees that day had attempted to break the police cordon that held back the crowd from heading toward the place de la concorde and the nearby ã lysã e palace the official home of president macron explosions in the distance shook our ears and the â marseillaiseâ sounded out through plumes of tear gas a surge against the police sought to open the way to concorde i joined it and i was hit with the gas and fled josset asked me whether i was okay â we will hold the champs as a strategic point of blockade â he told me he wore a yellow vest and a newsboy cap and he had glittering eyes â look around you this is the avenue of the rich it is symbolic to hold it but our message is not just here it must be worldwide itâ s on the world level that we must change things the rich are in every country they have billions upon billions and they always want more we cannot always have more on our little planet we fight for human value so that all people can live with dignity and for that we have to share â i asked josset about the policies he hoped to put in place with the weekly disruptions he suggested that i read the movementâ s demands published in leaflets and online among other things the gilets called for a reâ instatement of the tax on the superâ rich regulation and heavy taxation of monopolistic tech interests the â gafas as shorthanded in french with an air of contempt google amazon facebook apple lower taxes on small businesses and individual proprietors more funding for public schools hospitals childcare more public transit limits on executive compensation higher minimum wages and unemployment payouts a countrywide transition from fossil â fuels through progressive measures in which the rich pay for the transition and much else that ranged as far as a call for the toppling of the fifth republic a rewriting of the constitution and if necessary â frexitâ from the e u the gilets also demanded a radical reform of the legislative process mass popular referenda held at regular intervals would annul laws considered inimical to the public interest and presumably enact laws for the good of all the people these â referendums dâ initiative citoyennes â or r i c would be used to eject from power as if with the swoop of a guillotine hated elected officials such as emmanuel macron the r i c would be a program of extreme direct democracy none of these proposals are what come immediately to mind when most people think of the gilets jaunes in february after three months of protests serge halimi the editor in chief of le monde diplomatique surveyed for readers the preponderance of french media commentary on the movement and found it to be seething with contempt the gilets comprised a â hate â filled minority â said marianne a paris weekly and a horde of â losersâ who were â consumed by resentment as though by lice â according to le point another weekly â yellow vests will stupidity win â asked a le point editorialist they were â troublesome poujadist hicks â said a journalist at libã ration they were â barbariansâ and a â hooded mob â according to le figaro which quoted a constitutional expert who inveighed against the â reversion to a primitive form of class struggle â luc ferry a prominent french philosopher and political scientist stated that the police â should actually use their weapons for onceâ against â these thugs these bastardsâ from the suburbs who come looking for a fight â this contempt was coupled with falsehoods the gilets it was said were merely a vehicle for marine le penâ s right â wing national front recently rebranded as the rassemblement national or national rally whose supportersâ primary concern was to make france great again by oppressing or deporting the countryâ s 5 7â million muslims the gilets wanted gays oppressed as well the public was informed along with jews along with anyone who failed to meet the criteria of an idealized gallic identity the flag of which the gilets were purported to be carrying â in times when social groups crystallize and there is undisguised class struggle â halimi wrote everyone has to choose sides the center ground disappears and even the most liberal educated and distinguished people drop any pretense of peaceful coexistence that is what the middle class has done when faced with the gilets jaunes its usual spokespeople who carefully maintain the appearance of a plurality of opinion when times are calm have unanimously compared protesters to racists anti â semites homophobes plotters and troublemakers a whole social universe has banded together from the greens to the remnants of the socialist party from the french democratic confederation of labour to the presenters on france interâ s morning show american media followed the lead of their colleagues in france hewing to the narrative of country â bumpkin savages gone berserk reporting for the new republic alexander hurst called the gilets â uglyâ and â illiberal â their rise â inseparable from far â right politics â hurst purported to unveil the â anti â semitic heart of the yellow vest movement â the proof being a few disparate incidents of protesters cursing jews in the street or making nazi salutes behavior that somehow was to define a movement involving hundreds of thousands of people adam nossiter at the new york times writing in december opted for a portrait of gilets in the down â and â out town of guã ret in central france where the â acidicâ novels by a famous native son the anti â semitic 20th â century writer marcel jouhandeauâ had accustomed the residents of guã ret â to being mocked as the epitome of provincial backwardness â nossiter characterized the gilets with sly innuendo they were all of them â the descendants of those who inspired jouhandeauâ s characters â the timesâ editorial board exercised its discernment with a laughably inapt description of the gilets as the â cousinsâ of â the americans who voted for donald trump and the poles hungarians and italians who elected populist anti democratic governments â in three weeks of interviewing scores of gilets chosen at random in the streets of paris in other cities such as rouen and in small towns around the capital i found not one who fit this profileâ not one supporter of the national rally or marine le pen not one who mentioned jews or expressed hatred of immigrants or muslims or whose ideas of governance could be remotely described as â illiberal â when i mentioned donald trump what i got in response from those who bothered to follow u s â politics was spitting invective coupled with disgust at â stupid americansâ for having elected him among the gilets i met in paris was a twenty â nine â year â old priest named cyrgue dessauce of the communautã aã n karem a catholic parish in the city who wore leather sandals and a wooden cross around his neck and held at his stomach a framed portrait of the mother of christ â this is a movement that defends the poor â he told me â that demands the government serve the common good and not serve the economy â i met a fifty â three â year â old woman named nathalie konik a seasonal worker who was unemployed when we spoke who carried a â djembe and to the beat of the drum called out a plea for â the 140 000 homeless people across france who we donâ t see in the capital since they sleep in our forests by streams in the woods i am outraged at the sight of these families sleeping in the forest one would have thought that it came out of zolaâ s tales â on the champs ã lysã es i met a bespectacled thirteen â year â old named louis pines who wore on his yellow vest a badge that read the poliâ tician thinks of the next election the statesman thinks of the next generation his friend romann ramfal a seventeen â year â old whose mother had emigrated from mauritius told me â we see our parents struggling every day thatâ s why we are gilets jaunes â a pale sixty â one â year old blonde named â nelly urbaniak proffered a leaflet that described the â scandalâ of the planned privatization of the paris airports a dashingly handsome twenty â year â old business student named romain choquet â hubert told me that â this is the people against the elites for us liberalism is finished in france â he stood before a wall of police like an animal unleashed barking insults challenging them to attack laughing at their masked facesâ â your cowâ ardly masks what a shameful disgusting embarrassment you amount to servants of macron â â and then pulled me aside and on his smartphone swiped to find a chart of french voting profiles fifty â four percent of people employed as police officers voted for le pen in the last presidential election â you see the racists the fascists â he told me â itâ s the police â in april following the â assembly of assemblies â a meeting in saint â nazaire of the regional representatives of the gilets the movement officially announced its intention to force france â to abandon capitalismâ and â end the expropriation of the living â yannick jadot an environmental activist and gilets supporter who in 2009 was elected as a french representative to the european parliament summed up the thinking in an interview with agence france â presse â the climate explosion and the explosion of social inequality are two symptoms of the same model of development that harms the environment just as it harms men and women â the april appel invited the french people with the specter of climate disaster foremost in mind â to create together by all means necessary a new grassroots social â ecological movement â so why does the picture of the gilets jaunes as far â right xenophobes persist the french establishmentâ s slandering of the gilets according to serge halimi was entirely in service of class interests the middle and upper classes had closed ranks around macron and against the movement beginning in december when polls showed continuing popular support for the gilets despite their weekly disruptions â because the bourgeoisie didnâ t know where this would go â halimi told me â they saw an upsurge of spontaneous actors that were unfamiliar and frightening and they came to believe that macron was the only thing that stood between them and the mob they were truly afraid that support of a violent revolt would lead at the very least to economic chaos â related to this fear halimi told me â was a desire to tar or debase the revolutionary political â economic component with an undesirable social component â the gilets were not only racist jew â hating gay â bashing xenophobic anti â immigrant and nationalistic but also so ignorant and illiterate that they were unfit for the rigors of the global economy halimi cited socialist party luminary dominique strauss â kahn who in a 2002 book had laid out the lines of demarcation between those who would lead france in the age of globalization and those who would not among the former said strauss kahn who heavily influenced macronâ s inner circle of advisers were â salaried workers savvy informed and educated who form the backbone of our society they assure its stability because of their attachment to the â market economy â â as for â the least well â off group alas one cannot always expect peaceful participation in a parliamentary democracy â for american journalists the misconstruing of the gilets may have been due to the attempt to shoehorn them into the american political spectrum but for the french especially the countryâ s elites the gilets bore a troubling resemblance to the sansculottes of the revolution who also got their name for their choice of clothing the sansâ culottes were â a movement of the laboring poor small craftsmen shopkeepers artisans tiny entrepreneurs â wrote the historian eric hobsbawm and they too sought an â egalitarian and libertarian democracy localized and direct â they â provided the main striking â force of the revolutionâ the actual demonstrators rioters constructors of barricades â hobsbawm posited that the sansâ culottes driven by â hostility to the rich â innovated a new model of social change direct action or rioting the smashing of machines shops or the houses of the rich uch direct action by otherwise politically immature men and women could turn into a decisive force especially if it occurred in capital cities or other politically sensitive spots as it happens the ideologues who rose to power in 1793 on the backs of the sansculottes inaugurating the reign of terrorâ among them maximilien robespierre georges danton and jean â paul marat the leading figures who directed the committee of public safetyâ s guillotining of 17 000 citizensâ â offered the first hazy outline of what was to become the socialâ welfare system under threat today â society is obliged to provide for the subsistence of all its members either by procuring work for them or by assuring the means of existence to those who are unable to work â wrote robespierre a lawyer in his â proposed declaration of the rights of man and the citizen â marat a journalist prone to â mad calls for mob violence â as will and â ariel durant wrote in their hisâ tory of the period declared the need for massive wealth redistribution free and universal public schooling and â an assured subsistenceâ for the poor and the unemployed including â the wherewithal to feed lodge and clothe themselves suitably provision for attendance in sickness and old age and for bringing up children â if these things were not given freely warned the leadership of the terror then the poor had the right to take them by force using the power of riot the mob that had been unleashed was an ugly vicious blood â soaked creature at the charging of the bastille in july 1789â the event of july 14 that france commemorates as its most hallowed national holidayâ the rioters seizing rifles cannons and gunpowder decapitated the fort commander piked his head and paraded it through the streets by august the uprising that had spread across the country was â indiscriminate in its fury â according to the durants there were â countless assassinations of lords or rich bourgeois â and everywhere aristocrats who had abandoned their homes encountered â spontaneous anarchy â a deputy to the national assembly reported that â property of all kinds is a prey to the most criminal violence on all sides chã teaux are being burned convents destroyed â at the abbey of murbach in alsace the peasants who had worked the surrounding land â burned its library carried off its plate and linen uncorked its wine casks drank what they could and let the remainder flow down the drain â in september 1792 as a royalist army converged on paris to restore louis xvi to power the sansculottes their fury fanned by maratâ s editorials descended on the priests aristocrats and royalists who had been imprisoned by the thousands as sympathizers of counterrevolution the world would not be free as the credo of the day advised until the last king was strangled with the intestines of the last priest at the carmelite convent and the abbaye jail in paris the crowd killed the priests after summary judgment with swords knives and clubs at another prison in the city the princesse de lamballe â once very rich and very beautiful â a beloved friend of marie antoinette was beheaded her body mutilated her heart torn out and eaten on saturday march 16 an estimated 10 000 people gathered on the champs ã lysã es spreading such chaos that french media afterward declared it â the saturday of too much â the protesters included claude josset a retiree in her late sixties named marie â thã rã se marchon who carried the tricolor on a pole the enraged business student romain choquet â hubert a fifty â year â old quality control technician for the french aeronautics company safran named mark lafont a twenty â three year old unemployed woman named lã a beauvais who was a volunteer medic tasked with attending to the wounded and a professional dancer in her late forties named caroline alriq from bordeaux whose grandfather had fought in the resistance during world war ii and who had a habit of declaring a collaborateur anyone who conceded to neoliberalism in france â itâ s been five months that iâ ve hardly slept â alriq told me â iâ ve put my all into this movement i do it for my grandfather at the very least most french were not like him most french were silent collaborators â every one of these people and almost every person i met during the protest on the champs ã lysã es that day lived outside paris there were no leaders to whom they pointed for reference or whom they championed for office no charismatic figure who spoke for them and unlike participants in the protests and strikes typically mounted in france they espoused no party affiliation they were leaderless anarchistic a mass of individuals acting togetherâ and the only way to understand the whole was to understand each of them by noon the crowd had been cordoned by police so that they could not move toward the place de la concorde or the ã lysã e palace at the eastern end of the champs i was standing near the cordon as the line of riot copsâ â faceless masked armoredâ â stared down the gilets a terrific explosion nearby resounded in my eardrumsâ â it was a firework which the protesters often tossed at cops and elsewhere lit to spread confusion there was a massing of thousands of people who chanted â let us pass â suddenly as if shot from a cannon the crowd launched into the wall of police whose defensive line broke like a twig the officers falling to the ground and a flood of humanity was let loose the police mounted a furious counterattack with tear gas their batons swinging and their shields slamming into the crowd which was sent scattering back the way it came i was caught in the mad panic pushed against a wall and briefly suffocated my throat closed when the gas hit but i wore a balaclava and goggles and a bandanna over my face and i escaped the worst of it those who were less fortunate unprotected were temporarily blinded howling clutching one another arms out skin inflamed snot pouring from noses some with foam bubbling at their lips marie â thã rã se marchon carrying her tricolor wailing hysterically repeated over and over â we continue we continue we continue â i saw an old woman nearby about the same age as marchon beaten with truncheons a boyish man with big smiling eyesâ he looked to be no older than eighteenâ â turned to me and said â do not be afraid â he unwrapped his own flag within which a cobblestone lay nestled moments later with a screechy yawp he unleashed it at the police now there was a lull as if a sudden exhaustion had overcome the combatants and like a river reversing direction people turned and proceeded slowly west up the avenue this was the pattern all the day long skirâ mishes gassings and grenadings the gâ ilets repulsed at one spot only to rally again and attack at another there were more chants â anti â anti â cap â i â ta â lismâ and â down with macron â and the ever â repeated chorus of the â marseillaise â i met mark lafont the safran employee who lived in montmorency a suburb of paris and who told me â we are in a financial dictatorship i am here to topple it â somewhere in the crowd were his mother and father both in their seventies and he worried for them i joined lafont as he headed west toward the arc de triomphe where in the distance rose plumes of more tear gas i could hear the explosions of grenades and fireworks i looked away and lafont was gone along the avenue there was a carnival atmosphere street â fair â like the gilets holding sway sitting on curbs standing in knots talking smoking conspiring swilling beer hooting the war cry of â ah â oo ah â oo â or pondering with looks of dazed exhaustion the sun emerged from racing clouds and lit the avenue gilets with sweat on their brows diligently dug up cobbles or chipped fresh stone projectiles from the facades of buildings at irregular intervals they had built barricadesâ â chairs snatched from restaurants pieces of shattered wooden planters the plants torn out the soil scattered rubber mats stolen from outdoor cafã sâ â and set them on fire the smoke thick and black blotting out the sun and sickening to inhale i passed several burned out news kiosks the conflagrations thirty feet high one of the blazes caught a streetlamp which exploded and a crowd of hundreds watched the dance of the flames with a weird reverent silence why i asked myself do they destroy the kiosks those redoubts of small proprietors people of their own class who might have been natural allies who a day later would go on french television standing before the ruins of their businesses to express their loathing for the movement i thought it shameful stupid a sign of the mob lashing out mindless onward up the avenue i went where at the ã toile under the arc de triomphe more battles unfolded black â bloc anarchists clad in gas masks and helmets led the charge joined by gilets who released a rain of cobblestones that crackled on the armor of the riot cops molotov cocktails fell on the police and exploded dousing them in flame elsewhere wielding hammers and pieces of steel pipe and uprooted street signs the mob smashed windows of the celio boutique purveyor of fashionable menâ s clothing shirts and jackets and pants rose in the air like a fountain they looted the swarovski jewelry store its blue boxes scattered in the street by the hundreds emptied of watches bracelets rings earrings and brooches a gilet i talked with later said he laughed when he read that the blue swarovski box is â timeless â according to the companyâ s literature and that each one â contains a little bit of magic a sparkling piece of jewelry that can make us feel loved and extraordinary â they attacked longchamp the high end handbag retailer and hugo boss the clothier and eric bompard the â soul of cashmere â and omega the luxury swiss watch manufacturer the windows shattered naked mannequins tossed in the street and dismembered the merchandise looted or stomped or torn to rags the glass screens of the a t m s of hsbc were splintered from the blows of hammers fouquetâ s brasserie of the superâ rich where nicolas sarkozy the center â right president of france from 2007 to 2012 celebrated his election victory was ransacked and immolated the sociologists michel pincon and monique pincon charlot in a 2010 book described sarkozyâ s tenure as â an oligarchy a government of the rich for the rich â by the afternoon when the pompiers put out the fire and the posh brasserie was reduced to an ashen wreck the gilets gawked at their accomplishment and cracked jokes â itâ s such a shameâ where are we going to eat tonight â â iâ ll take a fried sarkozy please with a burnt macron â a sixty â year â old woman named michele fabiano who worked with handicapped children in public schools told me with proud disdain â i wonâ t cry for fouquetâ s â another battle erupted at the corner of rue balzac a trumpet sounded an air horn blew someone beat a drum veils of tear gas blotted out the sun and ashes from the flaming kiosks and burning barricades fell on our heads the crowd attacked with fragments of metal cobblestones and pieces of cannibalized bicycles and scooters showering the projectiles on a line of riot cops who retreated at a run â itâ s beautiful to see the people like this â said a man with a beer in hand and no front teeth and the hideous contorted face of a bosch figure the crowd tore down metal barriers erected on a storefront that were fourteen feet tall and twenty feet wide and together raised them to form massive shields which they wielded against the police as they charged up rue balzac the gilets exulted bellowing â ah â oo ah â ooâ and a chant of â rã â vo â lu â tion â the cops answered with another volley of tear gas the canisters skittering and exploding bouncing off peopleâ s heads i was hit with the poison directly collapsing to my knees blinded vomiting hyperventilating turned and twisted and crushed in the boiling crowd in what felt like a cattle drive from out of nowhere a balaclava â clad manâ i never saw his faceâ took me in his arms poured saline solution in my eyes and stood me up his name was tanguy twenty â three years old and i wanted to cling to him but in the churning of people he was gone i fled from the battle at rue balzac to the shattered hugo boss boutique on the south side of the avenue a father and child of seven in his arms watched the melee at a distance their faces lit with anticipation an elderly couple cackled at the sight of the smashed boss windows and wrecked vestibule câ est moi le boss declared the graffiti on the storeâ s walls i locked eyes with a yellow vested masked woman aged about fifty â five who pulled down her bandanna and smiled and gave me a deliriously happy thumbs â up i fled farther up a side street and found a medic station staffed with volunteers in white with red cross symbols on their shirts and helmets â itâ s been very bad today very violent they are gassing everybody â a medic told me stretched on the sidewalk were a half â dozen victims stunned listless in shock some with oxygen masks the injuries on march 16 i was told included a person who lost a hand from the dispersal grenades another whose foot was so lacerated from shrapnel that it hung by strings of flesh the seemingly indiscriminate use of these â nonâ lethalâ methods of crowd control by french authorities garnered condemnations from numerous human â rights groups including human rights watch and amnesty international lã a beauvais the medic told me the grenades exploded around her as she attempted to treat a man on the champs that day whom the police had pummeled beauvais showed me the spot where she had bandaged him the ground was splashed with a great deal of fresh blood and we stared at the blood in silence faced with the escalating police response to their own escalations the gilets of course could not hold the champs â ã lysã es for longer than the one symbolic day each week by nightfall on march 16 with at least eighty storefronts and other properties attacked an estimated 5 6â million in damage done in paris alone and some two hundred people arrested the protesters had been cleared from the avenue it was just one saturday in a continuum an act in a play with no end as the gilets had taken to calling their weekend ritual by april after more than five months of direct action and riot the gilets had caused nearly 200 million in property damage scaring off prospective visitors to france they were said to have reduced hotel bookings during a single month december 2018 by 1 1â percent throughout the country and by 5 3â percent in â paris the associâ ated press in february reported that since the advent of the movement 72 600 workers in 5 000 companies had been put on reduced hours for reduced pay and that businesses in city centers across france â saw revenue fall by 20 to 40â percent on average in recent weeks due to demonstrations taking place every saturday â bruno le maire minister of the economy said in december that the impact of the protests was â severe and ongoing â and he emphasized that â paris had been hit hardest the disruption the destruction the chaos had achieved at least some of the movementâ s goals immediately in the wake of the protests in december desperate to appease the mob macron scrapped the despised carbon tax he followed it that month with a 10 billion â euro stimulus package to aid the poor and lower middle classes of france despite the concerns of the austerity â minded european union in april after the violence of mid â march he announced further concessions estimated to cost an additional 5â billion euros which included tax cuts for lower â income households the indexing of pensions to inflation and greater latitude for mayors and regional elected officials to fend off cuts in public services in their districts serge halimi told me that the uprising had â stopped in its tracks macronâ s plan to eliminate one hundred twenty thousand public service jobs which are already in short supply it roused public opinion against the privatization of aã roports de paris and it is likely now that this very bad plan will not succeed none of this would have been possible without the gilets jaunes â the gilets could have claimed victory on these issues and gone home as of this writing they have not they have refused to be mollified by what they perceive as crumbs tossed from the throne of power their war against the rich in the age of climate change is one driven by an understanding unique among protest movements in france that the privilege to lord and the privilege to pollute are one and the same and that confronting the climate crisis means a confrontation with unregulated capitalism it is a call to arms that should resound across the world the rage is not going away and rage in france a remarkably unstable country among western democracies has had consequences the nation has progressed forward and regressed grievously in fits and spasms on an epic scale its first republic that of 1792 degenerated into mass murder then tyranny and the napoleonic wars the grandly humane ambition of libertã ã galitã fraternitã unrealized its second republic following the paris uprising of 1848â one led by the children of the sansculottes an armed working classâ lasted only three years dissipating in bonapartist restoration the revolt of the paris commune in 1871 gave way to the third republic which endured almost as long as the present â day fifth republic but ended in the national shame of collaboration the vichy police state and the deportation of 75 000 jewsâ and this in the country that in 1791 became the first in europe urged on by ensanguined revolutionaries like robespierre to declare jews official citizens with all due rights and protections the social â welfare system first envisioned during the terror was only successfully implemented following massive labor unrest after the trauma and dislocations of the great depression and once again after world warâ ii franceâ s constitution and its branches of government have been scrapped and reconfigured repeatedly for better and for worse in 1968 over the course of just a few days of revolt the fifth republic nearly collapsed the gilets have demanded a new republic based on social economic and not least ecological justice time will tell whether they have the strength and the means to bring france to the necessary point of crisis
financial markets iran u s global hegemony are you still in the market markets for equities and bonds have been struggling over the last one and a half years few real gains have been made and it has taken an important policy reversal by the fed just to keep the markets levitated at current levels neither earnings reports nor financial statistics seem to matter charts have not mattered the state of our domestic economy does not seem to matter either as global trade tariffs and sanctions are ignored in market valuations which remain scandalously unrealistic negative earnings guidance is at record levels but that too does not matter both market fundamentals and charts continue to be completely ignored every money manager simply follows announced guidance action of the federal reserve and evaluates their statements to the point of analyzing missing or modified words from previous fed press releases during the cold war its belligerents developed a theory and practice to deal with the very real risk of a nuclear conflagration the resulting adopted strategy was called mutually assured destruction or mad the operating theory was that neither nuclear power russia nor the united states would initiate a nuclear attack while remaining vulnerable because of the presumption of a vigorous response in kind destroying both countries and perhaps making life impossible on the whole planet from radiation fallout it now appears that the mutually assured destruction concept has been applied to the money management industry even if a fundamental analysis of the economy and current financial markets would require exiting those markets no major money management firm dares to raise cash massively or quickly for fear of starting a sales avalanche exposing market illiquidity algorithms pick up drastic market moves early and can magnify the trend which would bring market declines comparable to airplanes hitting air pockets market indicators most financial indicators for our economy are negative sales trends for homes and autos depict the poor health of the consumer in terms of big ticket items mall and store closings corroborate the real state of the economy as it relates to mid ticket spending ship air rail and trucking product transport statistics confirm a weak outlook for consumer spending manufacturing activity is making long term lows as factory orders decline the nation s sovereign debt is at a record a record for which no prize should be awarded trillion dollar budget deficits signal continued growth of this debt in the future eventually guaranteeing the destruction of this financial system and its global currency corporate debt is also a record levels with significant amounts of such debt used to finance stock repurchases that shrinks corporate equity which with increased debt weakens or enfeebles their balance sheets resulting in rating agency downgrading of corporate debt consumers also have record debt levels from auto educational and credit card balances such that demonstrably consumers are incapable of servicing their overwhelming debt or making significant consumer expenditures consumer debt is rising as savings rates are declining but not only is debt up but more tellingly delinquencies are up also notably consumer corporate and u s debt are all above that of the last financial crisis of 2008 beyond domestic economics international conditions do not seem supportive of growth markets or stability either the european union bond market is operating with zero and negative interest rates that union is financially and economically fragmenting as britain italy and greece and some other countries are not happy members eu member country sovereign banks are in various states of difficulty from high rates of default in business loan portfolios and insecure sovereign debt exposure of weaker countries germany is arguably the economically strongest and financially soundest country of the eu but its leading bank deutsche bank has experienced decline and deterioration for several years to the extent that it has become the eu bank to save existing and threatened additional sanctions extended trade tariff wars and required trade renegotiations are guaranteed to reduce trade and global economic growth rate these conditions are not supportive of record market valuation ray dalio super capitalist and manager of america s largest hedge fund bridgewater associates recently concluded in a thoughtful and lengthy article that capitalism is broken that proposition can be accepted and understood from the above noted trade economic and geopolitical trends ray dalio s article can be accessed as follows while an article which provides a solution to america s now failing capitalism can be accessed here how can financial markets continue to remain at record altitude when capitalism itself is seen to be broken the european union in disarray with incendiary geopolitics in the middle east on the verge of kinetic war but none of this is important to the market right if so then why do we need the current fed policy reversal and market stimulation continuing ten years after the last financial crisis and at a time when the stock market is near record territory why is the european central bank and the bank of japan still using crisis monetary policy the answer is that our domestic economy is in trouble debt is a deadweight to a consumer driven economy increased income disparity has significantly weakened all consumers and markets are manipulated by interest rates and financial derivatives and cannot levitate it for long at a minimum it is not a prudent time to be exposed to market vicissitudes for our previously stated thoughts on the market articulated over a year ago see stock market direction is no longer important means of investing investors seeking to invest generally will purchase mutual funds etfs or seek a personal money manager fund and individual money managers must invest such new funds even if they believe that the near term investment outlook is negative if money managers stay in cash the investor will move his account to a manager who will appear more proactive rather than sitting on the sidelines in addition management fees paid relate to the total amount of funds under management and are a strong incentive to invest even in precarious times in a market decline if the fund experiences a performance close to the average of all funds the manager is likely to keep the client therefore do not expect a money manager to risk the loss of client funds by remaining out of the market however wise individual investors can make the choice not to be a part of the herd heading for the cliff market declines when they occur historically have been multi year events for example the stock market declined from 1966 to 1982 if you bought stock in 1962 it took sixteen years to get even for those who purchased stock before the great depression in 1929 it took more than thirty years to get even on a nominal basis before considering the loss of purchasing power due to inflation more recently an investor buying stocks of the nasdq in 2001 recovered his losses only by 2016 with our markets being in record territory but struggling to maintain current levels this is not the correct time to buy it is even not the right time to hold investments as all prices will soon decline providing attractive investment entry points for those who wait being out of the market works for investors who have limited amounts invested and therefore works for the middle class individuals who have millions or more invested cannot effectively exit the market as large sums become impractical for liquidating or establishing large positions even if exiting the market means rolling over short term treasury notes iran iran has been in america s state department crosshairs for decades however it is important to understand the real reason for america s selecting and depicting iran as an enemy nation one must know and understand the history of iran over the last century in reality this targeting has nothing to do about iran s terrorism that you read about in the press the reasons for the conflict are far more fundamental and deep rooted for decades the british had controlled iran s governance and exploited its world class oil fields while leaving the iranian people destitute when after repeated failed attempts to renegotiate their oil concession the democratically elected president of iran nationalized their oil fields and closed britain s embassy in tehran our english cousins appealed to the u s for help when the cia overthrew iran s democratically elected president mossadegh in 1953 and installed a puppet government our elite global banking and oil cartel benefited financially from 40 of the millions of barrels of oil pumped daily from iran s oil fields when in 1979 iran s revolution threw out britain and the u s this cornucopia of billions of dollars profit was foreclosed to our oil oligarchs the effort over decades to destroy iran through international vilification condemnation financial war and sanctions such that the cabal could once more seize or control iran s oil is the real reason why america continually undermines iran it also wants to punish iran for their audacity to desire to be an independent sovereign nation rather than be part of the corralled and exploited oil rich nations and wants to keep iran from becoming influential in the middle east before america s unilateral regime change iran was friendly to american interests as both britain and russia had been invaders or colonists mossadegh had appealed to america as a country that itself had fought a war to free itself from british colonialism to help iran free itself from british colonialism and become a truly sovereign nation but when america the country with its beacon of liberty freedom and democracy for the world actually extinguished the democratically elected government of iran it lost its moral high ground over decades this has caused countries around the world to coalesce and dismiss america proselytizing democracy as a farce and increasingly oppose its geopolitical policies the history of iran and its shameful oil exploitation by the most developed and advanced countries in the world is depicted in iran the last century to the present important political decisions and their consequences since america chose sunni islam saudi arabia with which to make their petrodollar deal in the 1970s our loyalties required america to be against shia iran today our foreign policy and sanctions reduce the amount of oil being pumped in the middle east and especially that from iran and iraq such action serves to devastate iran while raising the price of oil which helps america s fracking oil producers to remain profitable middle east countries are interested in pumping all the oil that they can as most have little other sources of national income an ample flow of oil promotes a low international price of oil which helps all economies and consumers around the globe rather than oil producers whereas higher oil prices are likely to slow economic growth or precipitate a global recession had the united states not overthrown the only existing islamic democratic government and instead had made a petrodollar agreement with iran the history of the middle east would be completely different and far more favorable since iran borders with russia an oil deal between america and iran would have formed close security relations between the two countries such that iran would be oriented toward the west and america s military might have installed a defense force in iran near russia s border as iranians were fearful of communism this would have been a great win win for america western europe and iran instead iran russia and china are now close allies and america is losing influence in the middle east with an unravelling petrodollar unfortunately governments must live with the consequences of their policies u s global hegemony when the soviet union collapsed in 1989 the us saw an opportunity to be the world s singular leader a global hegemon after the soviet union s collapse russia engaged advisors from the u s to help them transition from their previous central planning to a market economy these advisors which included the imf and economists from harvard university provided advice which collapsed their economy and looted the state years later president putin observed that the biggest mistake that russia had made was trusting americans consequent state department foreign policy has angered its allies and alienated nonaligned countries such that they increasingly seek to avoid u s control iran like russia and china have been forced to seek allies of nations other than the united states as it became increasingly clear that america s financial and geo political actions were made to benefit solely maintaining its hegemony at the expense of every other country a current and stark example of ally blowback to america s policies is europe using its recently created instex money transfer system to bypass us sanctions regarding oil trade with iran both turkey and india have recently purchased the s 400 air defense systems from russia in stark condemnation of the u s it may be that this system simply has more value that is a more advanced system at a far more attractive price rather than it being about america and its politics however india s and turkey s resolve to purchase these systems and europe s decision to maintain trade with iran despite america s sanctions demonstrates that countries around the globe are rising against us geopolitical policies which means that the u s is increasingly becoming more isolated over the last century the u s has been the greatest economic financial and military force in the world its leadership status has made it natural to be the arbiter of global disputes the setter of geopolitical strategies and policies unfortunately these strategies have often shown to unilaterally benefit the united states at the expense of other smaller and weaker nations as a result over many decades these smaller nations have come to resent their being economically taken advantage of or being told what to do a smaller weaker country cannot take advantage of a larger stronger country the world just doesn t work that way repeating that smaller weaker nations continue to take advantage of the u s maybe effective propaganda but is pure bunk america can bomb almost any country back to the stone age it has that capability today and it has demonstrated its willingness to do so in the near past yet its power is not unlimited soon after wwii because of china s involvement america backed off and accepted the split of north and south korea see bombing nuclear threats and resolution because of the indomitable will of its people and unacceptance of u s citizens for an unnecessary extended war in a far off land america did not prevail in vietnam see america s gradual slide experience and withdrawal from vietnam our military efforts in the middle east afghanistan iraq iran syria libya and yemen were destructive and disruptive but have not been effective over time on a relative basis the gap between america s military might and other nations is narrowing ironically to some degree this is due to america selling military equipment to other countries and training buyers in its effective use advising or training foreign troops also narrows this gap particularly if over time a foreign country s allegiance changes of course america s major competitors and weapons manufacturers are doing the same thing thereby narrowing the gap between america and the rest as a result conflict has migrated to trade and the financial sphere where the u s still maintains significant advantages over other countries the global reserve dollar is the key advantage and unsurprisingly it is now targeted to be dislodged sidestepping direct military confrontation china has implemented a visionary trade plan which has the prospect of benefiting half of the globe s population reducing poverty rates and improving living standards its belt and road initiative bri will connect many countries from china to europe in trade which heretofore have been in global economic backwaters the irony is that any country seeking to be or remain a global hegemon must obstruct such development as it is easier to control weaker undeveloped rather than developed countries accordingly it must try to retard such development this concept is not new as britain and other colonialist countries used such diabolical repression for centuries to facilitate and maintain their own supremacy it was morally wrong of these purveyors of christianity to suppress peoples of other cultures solely for their own benefit and it is wrong to do so now so how does one keep china russia and other more developed potential contenders from challenging america s preeminent position in the current economic situation one would work hard both overtly and covertly to keep the bri from succeeding that will retard both china s and russia s development and advancement the logical place where to create a break in the bri is the geographically and strategically located iran this strategy would achieve two things at once it keeps iran repressed and china and russia restrained such strategy in a hegemon s view likely merits the threat of war however regardless of the rhetoric america will not go to war with iran actually more precisely america is already at war with iran as it has been for decades financial war is war also sanctions is a real war by other means both are highly destructive without spilling blood but we will not see america s boots on iran s ground why china and russia are equally aware that america is obstructing bri s development however china s and russia s financial and geopolitical investment in iran is measured in billions iran s geographical location is of strategic importance to the bri and they will support and if need be protect iran from invasion and destruction america s understanding of this backstop by a group of powerful nations opposing u s hegemony will keep it from engaging its military machine there may be proxy actions by america s middle east allies but recognition of the global balance of power will prevent full scale military war conflation let us once again consider the over bloated financial markets in context of the three principal elements discussed in this article affecting their future performance few will argue that measures of financial value both in equities and fixed income are extreme one cannot argue that levels of government corporate and consumer debt are also not extreme beyond any ability to be repaid in full without complete destruction of its currency it is equally impossible to argue that in light of increased consumer debt and increased default rates that the consumer driven economy is healthy based on international trade and tumult in global markets due to tariffs sanctions and instability of the european union global economic growth in the developed world will remain weak america s global military and trade hegemony is receding as other nations grow stronger the financial unipolar dollar world is changing likely to evolve with a number of global trade currencies diminishing the role of the dollar all of these events conflate to an environment not constructive to our bubble financial markets iran and the middle east will remain in the news as a disruptive area for many years china s bri will traverse iran and as a result both china and russia will profit mightily and therefore have a strategic interest in protecting iran from continued british or american usurpation they will intervene directly by financial or military means to save their investment and their strategic client state and safeguard the whole of their trade belt to europe capitalism with american characteristics is indeed broken as our citizens are suffering because of it our leaders would be wise in trying to heal our nation rather than seek risky adventures outside our own borders america s slow retreat from its prior global hegemony is irreversible so it should be accepted without the need for wwiii other parts of the globe will rise empowering other countries and cultures america can take pride in its past role of global development and containment of evil forces in the last century life goes on so can the markets still rise sure indeed the fed s indication that there may be one or more interest rate reductions this year signifies that the bubble may inflate further before bursting in that context the fed is disingenuous highly depending on the ignorance of the masses in stating that it has not achieved its desired 2 rate of inflation because the printing of money is the definition of inflation the fed has achieved multiples of that target and its subsequent rise in prices is corroborated by the bloated bubble markets of investment and other assets the fact that such data is excluded from a measure of consumer price increases is simply fraudulent this is not an opportune time to be invested there is a bright investment future on the horizon but we must be willing to wait for it not losing money is the first and most important rule for investors the expected rate reductions by the fed will take time to work through as will subsequent increases the cathartic market decline will take time the restructuring of the global economy away from dollar dominance will take time our own dollar reset in terms of debt pension and medical liabilities will be traumatic and also take years so it may be prudent not to be in the markets for the next several years particularly if you believe in the investing formula of sell high buy low those following this rule will have the cash to buy low and sell high are you still in the market raymond matison mr matison was an institutional investor

for years western observers and media have been talking about the rise of asia in terms of its massive future potential but the time has come for the rest of the world to update its thinkingâ because the future arrived even faster than expected one of the most dramatic developments of the past 30 years has been emerging asiaâ s soaring consumption and its integration into global flows of trade capital talent and innovation in the decades ahead asiaâ s economies will go from participating in these flows to determining their shape and direction indeed in many areasâ from the internet to trade and luxury goodsâ they already are the question is no longer how quickly asia will rise it is how asia will lead of course it is hard to generalize about such a vast swathe of the world spanning myriad languages ethnicities and religions these nations have widely varying forms of government economic systems and human development indicators some have young and growing populations while others are aging annual per capita income ranges from 849 in nepal to 57 714 in singapore the region encompasses ancient ruins and bullet trains rural farming villages and towering skyscrapers the common thread across this diverse region is an upward trajectory across key economic and social indicators in 2000 asia accounted for just under one third of global gdp in terms of purchasing power parity and it is on track to top 50 percent by 2040 by that point it is expected to account for 40 percent of the worldâ s total consumption asia is making not only economic progress but rapid strides in human development from longer life spans and greater literacy to a dramatic surge in internet use the regionâ s rise has not only lifted hundreds of millions out of extreme poverty it has also raised living standards more broadly for people of every income level urbanizationâ is fueling economic growth and opening doors to education and public health services but pockets of poverty and real development challenges remain the breakneck pace of growth has left many cities struggling to provide the housing infrastructure and other services that their surging populations need countries across the region need to achieve more inclusive and sustainable economic growth to address inequality and environmental stresses recent mckinsey global institute mgi researchâ examined 71 developing economies and singled out 18 of them for consistently posting robust economic gdp growth all seven long term outperformers and five out of 11 recent outperformers are located in asia in recent decades several asian countries have propelled themselves into the ranks of middle income and even advanced economies this reflects the regionâ s ongoing industrialization and urbanization its rising demand and productivity growth and its dynamic corporate sector these trends represent a real shift in the worldâ s center of gravity scholar parag khanna asserts that the â asian centuryâ has begun and observes that the regionâ s rise is not cyclical but structural emerging asiaâ s evolution has reached a stage that requires deeper global acknowledgment it is upending assumptionsâ long held in the west in other emerging economies and even in asia itselfâ about the worldâ s economic balance this paper provides an overview of asiaâ s role in four areas trade flows and networks corporations in asia technology and the asian consumer mgi will return to each of these topics with more extensive stand alone research reports in the months ahead yet combining these perspectives as we do here provides a wider view of how the region is evolvingâ and a hint of how it might define the future section 1 asia is transforming trade recent mgi researchâ examined 23 industry value chains spanning 43 countries and documented major structural shifts in the worldâ s trade patterns asia is at the center of many of these changes and its companies will continue to respond to them in the years ahead over the past decade global output has continued to rise but the share of goods traded across borders has fallen by 5 6 percentage points this decline does not reflect trade disputes or hint at an impending slowdown instead it reflects healthy economic development in china india and the rest of emerging asia as consumption rises more of what gets made in these countries is now sold locally instead of being exported to the west over the decade from 2007 to 2017 china almost tripled its production of labor intensive goods from 3 1 trillion to 8 8 trillion at the same time the share of gross output china exports has dramatically decreased from 15 5 percent to 8 3 percent india has similarly been exporting a smaller share of its output over time this implies that more goods are being consumed domestically rather than exported furthermore as the regionâ s emerging economies develop new industrial capabilities and begin making more sophisticated products they are becoming less reliant on foreign imports of both intermediate inputs and final goods the previous era of globalization was marked by western companies building supply chains that stretched halfway around the world as they sought out the lowest possible labor costsâ and often their supply chains ran through asia now labor arbitrage is on the wane only 18 percent of todayâ s goods trade now involves exports from low wage countries to high wage countriesâ a far smaller share than most people assume and one that is declining in many industries download the full report pdf 1 44mb in chinese labor intensive manufacturing for export was a major engine of chinaâ s rise and it has historically been the clear path to economic development for poor countries however opportunities to compete on the basis of low cost labor are narrowing as wages rise across the region and as automation technologies are adopted more widely for some in the region the window is not closed yet as wages rise in china and the country moves into higher value activities its share of global exports of labor intensive goods has declined by three percentage points this has created an opening for other countries to step in in the past decade vietnam india and bangladesh have managed to grow their exports of labor intensive manufactured goods particularly textiles by annual rates of 15 percent 8 percent and 7 percent respectively exhibit 1 this trend can turn unknown cities into new manufacturing hot spots 1 nevertheless infrastructure workforce skills and productivity will be critical to competitiveness in the decade ahead low cost labor alone will not be enough all industry value chains now rely more heavily on r d and innovationâ and the share of value generated by the actual production of goods is declining these shifts combined with a wave of new manufacturing and logistics technologies mean that countries across asia will need to alter their investment priorities and develop new types of skills to compete in a more knowledge intensive trade landscape companies are increasingly focused on speed to marketâ and improving coordination and visibility across the entire value chainâ goals that are hard to achieve when suppliers are halfway around the globe as a result supply chains are becoming shorter and more localized intra regional trade is increasing at the expense of long haul trade because of its diversity and geographic sweep asia is not and likely will never be the same kind of tightly integrated trade entity as the european union or nafta although it is a looser constellation of countries trade ties and cooperation are deepening across the region today 52 percent of asian trade is intra regional compared to just 41 percent in north america this points toward a new trend of firms building self contained regional supply chains to serve asian markets it also indicates deepening trade ties among asian countries themselvesâ with much more room to grow the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep is a new free trade agreement that includes 16 countries across the region including china japan india and vietnam while trade in goods has flattened service flows have become the real connective tissue of the global economy in fact services trade is growing 60 percent faster than trade in goodsâ and asiaâ s services trade is growing 1 7 times faster than the rest of the worldâ s while india and the philippines are among the biggest exporters of back office business services trade in knowledge intensive services is still in its infancy across most asian countries and represents an important gap to be filled in our follow on research we will take a more holistic view of how asia is developing global networks among the questions for the future what kind of networks are forming across asia and how will they shape global trends what is the role of each country which cities will be the hot spots of the future in different fields how will asiaâ s evolution change the center of gravity within various sectors section 2 asian corporates are on the rise asiaâ s changing role within industry value chains described above reflects the rapid evolution of the regionâ s corporations growth is occurring not only on the demand side of emerging economies but also on the supply side changing competitive dynamics worldwide many asian companies now rank among the worldâ s largest exhibit 2 their track record is uneven but their presenceâ in sheer size and numbersâ is game changing in the 2018 fortune global 500 ranking 210 of the worldâ s 500 biggest companies by revenue were asian asiaâ s share of the top performing firms globally has also increased from 19 percent to 30 percent over the past two decades 2 we also looked more broadly at the 5 000 largest global firms in 1997 asia accounted for only 36 percent of them but by 2017 that share was up to 43 percent whatâ s more the countries represented in this group have drastically changed china accounts for the biggest increase by far but india has also seen significant growth and countries such as the philippines vietnam kazakhstan and bangladesh are now represented on the list by contrast half of japanâ s largest firms have dropped off asian firms have become global market leaders not only in industrial and automotive sectors but in areas like technology finance and logistics over the past 20 years as these economies have evolved the industry mix of the regionâ s largest firms has shifted manufacturing of capital goods is now a smaller share of the regionâ s economy while infrastructure and financial services have grown significantly the ownership structures growth strategies and operating styles of asian corporate giantsâ differ from those of publicly owned western multinationals about two thirds of the 110 chinese companies in the fortune 500 are state owned the region also has a number of large conglomerates south koreaâ s top five family controlled chaebols together account for roughly half of the value in the countryâ s stock market japanâ s â big sixâ keiretsu similarly have outsize weight in the countryâ s equity market each one owns dozens of companies spanning several industries all major japanese car manufacturers for example can be tied back to a keiretsu indiaâ s top six conglomerates alone employ more than two million people a firm with a controlling shareholderâ whether family founder or stateâ may focus on expanding its position through top line growth and is able to take a longer term view about accomplishing that goal this stands in contrast to widely held public firms that must answer to shareholders every quarter and are more focused on maximizing earnings in the immediate term despite the varying degree of government involvement in economies across the region competition remains high some companies enjoy government support but it is often tied to performance goals across the region the churn rate of firms in the top quintile of performance is some 20 percentage points higher in asia than in advanced economiesâ in the rest of the world in the decade since 2005â 07 the economic profit produced by top quintile asian firms increased by 57 percent versus 33 percent in north america however as in the west the distribution of economic profit and loss is skewed recent mgi research analyzed more than 5 000 of the worldâ s largest public and private firms with annual revenues above 1 billion it identified a so called â superstarâ phenomenonâ that is a set of firms that capture a greater share of income and are pulling away from their peers asia accounts for 30 percent of all global superstar firms up from 15 percent in the 1990s most of these companies are from china india japan and korea the region is producing more global superstar firms over time although it is still underrepresented mgi found that firms in the top decile of performance are generating higher economic profits than ever before while losses are growing among the worst performing firms some of which are â zombieâ firms that actually destroy value this effect tends to squeeze the firms in the middle of the distribution this phenomenon is global and it is particularly pronounced in asia in the decade since 2005â 07 the economic profit produced by top quintile asian firms increased by 57 percent versus 33 percent in north america meanwhile the economic profit destroyed by bottom quintile asian firms increased sevenfold versus 2 5 times in north america the revenues produced by the regionâ s superstar firms are seven times larger than those of their median counterparts and their roic is 2 2 times higher the most dominant sectors within this group are computers and electronics automotive and banking at the other end of the performance curve a significant number of firms in the region are in the bottom decile for economic profit globally many of them are in the natural resource processing machinery and equipment and real estate industries the superstar effect in the corporate world is mirrored by widening disparities between cities regions and population segments asia may be replicating some of the patterns that have taken hold in the west in forthcoming research mgi will delve more deeply into the rise of asian firms and explore questions for the future how competitive are asian firms globally how has their evolution challenged global dynamics what does â winningâ mean for asian companies how are business models evolving across the region how is the growth of the corporate sector changing asian society more broadly section 3 asia is shaping the future of digital innovation globally asia is online and booming today it already accounts for half 2 2 billion of the worldâ s internet users chinaâ and indiaâ alone account for one third exhibit 3 the regionâ s enormous pools of digital consumers support a flourishing and innovative technology sector 3 china japan south korea and singapore are among the most digitally advanced nations in the world china has joined these ranks with startling speed in e commerce for example china accounted for less than 1 percent of the value of worldwide transactions only about a decade ago that share is now more than 40 percent penetration of mobile payments among chinaâ s internet users grew from just 25 percent in 2013 to 68 percent in 2016 three of chinaâ s internet giantsâ baidu alibaba and tencentâ are building a rich digital ecosystem now growing beyond them asia has ample venture capital to support technology innovation and entrepreneurship china now ranks second only to the united states in terms of start up investment from 2014 through 2016 china provided just under 20 percent of the worldâ s venture capital india is also catching up quickly tripling germanyâ s venture funding in 2018 asia now accounts for nearly half of global investment it is now among the top global sources and destinations for venture capital in fields such as virtual reality autonomous vehicles 3 d printing robotics drones and artificial intelligence ai innovation hubs are starting to take root as of april 2019 asia was home to more than one third 119 of the worldâ s 331 â unicornsâ start ups valued at more than 1 billion ninety one of these companies are in china followed by india with 13 south korea with six and indonesia at four by comparison the united states is home to 161 unicorns while the united kingdom has 16 and germany has nine would you like to learn more about the mckinsey global institute china has made ai developmentâ a strategic priority and it currently ranks as one of the global leaders in this field south korea and singapore also have major national initiatives to build ai capabilities japan has similar ambitions and recently announced new courses in its universities and technical schools to produce 250 000 graduates annually with proficiency in ai despite this flurry of activity and innovation some two billion people across the region lack internet access including many in rural areas of india china and indonesia building out backbone digital infrastructure beyond major cities and bringing more of this population online is an issue for both economic and human development however even lagging countries are rapidly digitizing private sector innovation is bringing internet enabled services to millions of consumers and made online usage more accessible as this process unfolds it is creating a mobile first environment with large populations skipping over the stages of broadband and pc usage altogether in favor of mobile phone usage and applications indonesia and india have outpaced the world in the speed of digital adoption over the past three yearsâ and once new users go online they quickly gain digital savvy the number of internet subscribers in india alone has almost doubled since 2014 to 560 million their use of mobile data is growing at 152 percent annuallyâ more than twice the rates in the united states in a promising step that could serve as a model for other asian countries still in the earlier stages of their digitization journey the indian government has managed to enroll more than 1 2 billion people in a biometric digital identityâ program this has given many people a legal identity for the first time making it possible for them to access banking credit government benefits education and other services india has also brought more than ten million businesses onto a common digital platform through a goods and service tax these types of initiatives can accelerate the process of digitization more broadly across entire economies whether they are digital leaders or laggards the next stage of the journey for countries across the region is to go beyond consumer use and encourage wider adoption of digital tools in traditional sectors from agriculture to retail and logistics similarly the public and social sectors can continue deploying digital systems to make government services and healthcare more efficient the ultimate goal is harnessing the latest technology tools to boost productivity in a meaningful way innovation hubs are starting to take root as of april 2019 asia was home to more than one third of the worldâ s â unicornsâ start ups valued at more than 1 billion ninety one of these companies are in china followed by india with 13 south korea with six and indonesia at four asian countries are breaking through to the forefront of innovation and technology in the next phase of our research mgi will explore questions for the future where will asiaâ s versions of silicon valley emerge how will they differ from start up hubs in other parts of the world how competitive is asiaâ s innovation environment who is driving innovation in asia how do innovative firms in asia operate and lead what can policy makers and corporations do to accelerate the adoption of both basic and advanced digital tools to propel productivity growth section 4 asia s consumers are a force in the global economy over the past two decades global poverty has dropped dramatically some 1 2 billion people have been propelled into the consuming class meaning that they have passed the income level at which they can begin to make significant discretionary purchases this is one of the greatest economic success stories in historyâ and it is very much an asian story today those legions of households are flexing growing spending power mckinsey projects that the region will fuel half of all the consumption growth expected worldwide over the course of the next decade by 2030 it is projected to account for more than half of global consumption growth exhibit 4 4 the growing asian middle class will soon be three billion strong southeast asia alone had some 80 million households in the consuming class just a few years ago now that number is on track to double to 163 million households by 2030 with indonesia in particular generating tens of millions of newly prosperous consumers the region is one of the most important markets for international companies asian consumers have long had a strong preference for foreign luxury goods and brands but things are changing the post 90s generation is starting to lose this bias against domestic brands in fact they are starting to choose them over foreign brands more often whether they are asian or western brands need highly targeted strategies to succeed across such a diverse and fragmented regionâ where wealthy advanced economies already have well developed brands and retail channels but new consumers in developing economies still need to acquire many basics the most striking rise in consumptionâ has occurred in china previous mgi research highlighted chinaâ s working age population as one of the worldâ s key consumer demographics by 2030 this group could account for 12 cents of every 1 of worldwide urban consumption growing wealth in china has created an affluent class of aspirational consumers in 2018 fewer than 30 million chinese consumers accounted for one third of global spending on luxury goods and mckinsey projects that their outlay will almost double by 2025 the â asian consumerâ resists easy characterization the regionâ s seniors for example will drive 15 percent of global consumption growth adding some 660 billion to what they already spend today asiaâ s generation z has different buying behaviors and values they have grown up with unprecedented wealth greater exposure to western culture and digital savvy the luxury purchases of young chinese consumers are heavily influenced by their media consumption and their desire to be seen and snapped in the latest styles the â asian consumerâ resists easy characterization the regionâ s seniors for example will drive 15 percent of global consumption growth adding some 660 billion to what they already spend today asiaâ s generation z has different buying behaviors and values consumer markets across the region are experiencing not only tremendous growth but also dynamic change as new consumers quickly move past basic purchases form new brand loyalties and hit the point at which they can purchase some personal indulgences and express their own fashion and style as companies strive to meet ever high expectations asian consumers will increasingly set trends for the rest of the world mgiâ s forthcoming research into asiaâ s consumption will explore a number of questions for the future which consumer groups will be the main drivers of future growth how big are nascent markets for services experience and data how can companies tap into them how will the rise of generation z shape future consumption patterns in asia how does asiaâ s generation z differ from their western peers how is asia aging how will this wave change consumption patterns asia is a hub of world trade home to some of the worldâ s largest companies the fastest growing part of the internet and the engine of global consumption growth in the months ahead mgi will return to each of these topics with a series of comprehensive research reports we hope to illuminate not only the

the federal reserve will cut interest rates to help the economy and investors are virtually certain that it will happen at the next fed meeting at the end of this month the only question investors say is how deeply the fed will cut when it lowers rates for the first time in a decade until then the main drivers for the market will likely be the hundreds of earnings reports scheduled to come from big companies showing how much profit they made from april through june it s waiting for this really all important second quarter earnings season to heat up said thomas martin senior portfolio manager at globalt investments expectations are generally dim and wall street is forecasting a 3 drop in earnings per share for s p 500 companies from a year ago that would mark the first back to back drop in three years according to factset this week roughly a fifth of the companies in the s p 500 are set to report their second quarter results citigroup was one of the reporting season s early headliners

this time around with analysts forecasting the worst drop in quarterly earnings for the s p 500 in three years at 3 according to factset the bar for corporate earnings has been set quite low and we don t think it will take much to surprise on the upside said jon adams senior investment strategist at bmo global asset management that s why he said he ll be paying close attention to which companies are able to grow their revenues despite the stronger dollar and weakening economic trends around the world and not just which companies are beating earnings forecasts he s also focusing on companies able to keep their profit margins high when wage growth for workers at many companies is starting to nudge higher several economic reports are also on the schedule this week including updates on retail sales the housing industry and shoppers confidence the u s economy has generally remained solid but investors don t expect this week s reports to alter the direction of the fed which has already given hints about rate cuts given weakening economic trends around the world the white house s repeated threats to raise tariffs has made companies in the u s more hesitant and hurt trade internationally they re a big reason that china on monday reported its weakest quarter of economic growth in at least 26 years you could make a case that the fed shouldn t need to cut in this market

in the general theory of employment interest and money john maynard keynes wrote the ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by little else practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist i think lord keynes himself would appreciate the irony that he has become the defunct economist under whose influence the academic and bureaucratic classes now toil slaves to what has become as much a religious belief system as an economic theory men and women who display appropriate skepticism on other topics indiscriminately funnel facts and data through a keynesian filter without ever questioning the basic assumptions some go on to prescribe government policies that have profound effects upon the citizens of their nations and when those policies create the conditions that engender the income inequality they so righteously oppose they often prescribe more of the same bad medicine like 18th century physicians applying leeches to their patients they take comfort that all right minded people will concur with their recommended treatments this is an ongoing series of a discussion between ray dalio and myself read part 1 part 2 part 3 and part 4 today s article addresses the philosophical problem he is trying to address income and wealth inequality last week i dealt with the equally significant problem of growing debt in the united states and the rest of the world the keynesian tools much of the economic establishment wants to use are exacerbating the problems ray would like to solve it with a blend of monetary and fiscal policy what he calls monetary policy 3 the problem with keynesianism let s start with a classic definition of keynesianism from wikipedia so that we can all be comfortable that i m not coloring the definition with my own bias and yes i admit i have a bias emphasis mine keynesian economics or keynesianism is the view that in the short run especially during recessions economic output is strongly influenced by aggregate demand total spending in the economy in the keynesian view aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy instead it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically affecting production employment and inflation the theories forming the basis of keynesian economics were first presented by the british economist john maynard keynes in his book the general theory of employment interest and money published in 1936 during the great depression keynes contrasted his approach to the aggregate supply focused classical economics that preceded his book the interpretations of keynes that followed are contentious and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy keynesian economists often argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector in particular monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government in order to stabilize output over the business cycle keynesian economics advocates a mixed economy predominantly private sector but with a role for government intervention during recessions central banks around the world and much of academia have been totally captured by keynesian thinking in the current avant garde world of neo keynesianism consumer demand consumption is everything federal reserve policy is clearly driven by the desire to stimulate demand through lower interest rates and easy money and keynesian economists of all stripes want fiscal policy essentially government budgets to increase consumer demand if the consumer can t do it the reasoning goes then the government should step into the breach this of course requires deficit spending and borrowed money including from your local central bank essentially when a central bank lowers interest rates it is encouraging banks to lend money to businesses and telling consumers to borrow money to spend economists like to see fiscal stimulus at the same time as well they point to the numerous recessions that have ended after fiscal stimulus and lower rates were applied they see the ending of recessions as proof that keynesian doctrine works this thinking has several problems the flaws of keynesian stimulus first using leverage borrowed money to stimulate spending today must by definition reduce consumption in the future debt is future consumption denied or future consumption brought forward keynesian economists argue that bringing just enough future consumption into the present to stimulate positive growth outweighs the future drag on consumption as long as there is still positive growth leverage just equalizes the ups and downs this has a certain logic of course which is why it is such a widespread belief keynes argued however that money borrowed to alleviate recession should be repaid when growth resumes my reading of keynes does not suggest he believed in the unending fiscal stimulus his disciples encourage today secondly as has been well documented by ken rogoff and carmen reinhart there comes a point at which too much leverage becomes destructive there is no exact way to know that point it arrives when lenders typically in the private sector decide that borrowers whether private or government might have some difficulty repaying and begin asking for more interest to compensate for their risks an overleveraged economy can t afford the higher rates and economic contraction ensues sometimes the contraction is severe sometimes it can be absorbed when accompanied by the popping of an economic bubble it is particularly disastrous and can take a decade or longer to work itself out as the developed world is finding out now every major economic miracle since the end of world war ii has been a result of leverage often this leverage has been accompanied by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies every single miracle has ended in tears with the exception of the current recent runaway expansion in china which is still in its early stages insufficient income causes recessions i would argue along i think with the austrian economist hayek and other economic schools that recessions are not the result of insufficient consumption but rather insufficient income fiscal and monetary policy should aim to grow incomes over the entire range of the economy that is best accomplished by making it easier for entrepreneurs and businesspeople to provide goods and services when businesses increase production they hire more workers and incomes go up without income there are no tax revenues to redistribute without income and production nothing of any economic significance happens keynes was correct when he observed that recessions are periods of reduced consumption but that is a result and not a cause entrepreneurs must be willing to create a product or offer a service in the hope there will be sufficient demand for their work there are no guarantees and they risk economic peril with their ventures whether we re talking about the local bakery or hairdressing shop or elon musk trying to compete with the world s largest automakers if government or central bank policies hamper their efforts the economy stagnates the reason keynesianism sticks many politicians and academics favor keynesianism because it offers a theory by which government actions can become decisive in the economy it lets governments and central banks meddle in the economy and feel justified it allows 12 people sitting in a board room in washington dc to feel they are in charge of setting the most important price in the world the price of money interest rates of the us dollar and that they know more than the entrepreneurs and businesspeople who are actually in the market risking their own capital every day this is essentially the platonic philosopher king conceit the hubristic notion that a small group of wise elites is capable of directing the economic actions of a country no matter how educated or successful the populace has been on its own and never mind that the world has multiple clear examples of how central controls eventually slow growth and make things worse over time it is only when free people are allowed to set their own prices of goods and services and yes even interest rates that valid market clearing prices can be determined trying to control them results in one group being favored over another in today s world savers and entrepreneurs are left to eat the crumbs that fall from the plates of the well connected crony capitalists and live off the income from repressed interest rates the irony of using cheap money to drive consumer demand is that retirees and savers get less money to spend and that clearly drives their consumption down why is the consumption produced by ballooning debt better than the consumption produced by hard work and savings this is trickle down monetary policy which ironically favors the very large banks and

the economic policies announced by the new government and the measures taken since june for making a naya pakistan have destabilized the economy of the country all sections of society rich or poor industrialist or middle class are deeply worried and restless as a result of the new fiscal policies the public is uncertain about the economic difficulties awaiting them in the new financial year the government s economic experts are merely implementers of the economic policies of international financial institutions beside what has already been borrowed about 10 billion is in the pipeline the implementation of the first regular federal budget for 2019 2020 which was passed by the national assembly has come into force despite strong opposition to its provisions the imf approved a 6 billion bailout extended fund facility of which the first tranche of 1 billion has been received the disbursement of cash loans from friendly countries has taken place and the supply of petroleum against deferred payment started from july 1 under the assets declaration scheme and in an atmosphere of fear and retribution about rs65 billion has been received as revenue on a discounted rate of taxation for benami assets declared in addition over 100 000 new tax filers have filed tax returns despite the host of measures taken by the government to meet the fiscal and foreign exchange deficit and despite the untiring efforts of the government s economic team to justify these measures all segments of society are gravely worried worried about increasing inflation the upward adjustment of the rupee against the dollar on an almost daily basis the falling prices of stocks in the stock market and the virtually dormant real estate market there is a pervasive fear that as the conditions of the imf programme unfold during the current financial year conditions for the people may deteriorate even further there is talk about the dollarization of the economy the explanations given by the government s economic management team have failed to pacify citizens and there are reports of demonstrations and protests from various chambers of commerce and industry and other trade and public bodies it is our national misfortune that since independence in 1947 our national economy has always remained unstable and dependent on foreign assistance we have been unable to achieve economic independence and self reliance even after seven decades all successive governments have always looked for grants and dole outs there have been some short periods of economic growth during these 70 years as during the ayub era but due to the overwhelmingly faulty economic planning policies and programmes the health of the country s economy has worsened and self reliance and economic growth have failed to keep pace with the growing population during the sixties the economy of united pakistan was growing at an average rate of 6 8 percent per annum during the seventies this rate dropped to 4 8 percent per annum while the population increased from 65 million to 85 million bringing with it multiplying difficulties for the people at the end of the sixties and beginning seventies protests and sloganeering started aimed at damaging the earlier economic gains concentration of wealth in the hands of 22 families became a popular political outcry instruments like bonus vouchers import export licensing and resultant multiple exchange rates were vehemently criticized loans extended by financial institutions such as picic adbp icp nit etc to set up new industrial units were also perceived as responsible for spreading corruption in society the agricultural and industrial progress achieved during the government of field marshal ayub khan was ignored the pakistan people s party the political party that came into power for the first time held ayub khan responsible for all the economic woes they inherited in this unstable and uncertain political atmosphere the responsibility to revive the national economy was assigned to dr mubashar hassan in december 1971 he held the important portfolios of minister of finance and minister of planning and development until october 1974 dr mubashar hassan who is now 97 years old may the almighty give him long life and good health ameen obtained a bsc degree in civil engineering from punjab university in 1947 he later obtained msc and phd degrees from iowa university and columbia university in the us in civil engineering and hydraulic engineering respectively after returning he taught at uet lahore and was held in great esteem as a devoted and accomplished teacher of civil engineering in 1967 when he co founded the pakistan people s party with mr zulfikar ali bhutto and mr j a rahim he became exposed to the vagaries of politics and from there his influence in the making or unmaking of the economic policies of pakistan started this period came to an end with the fall of the ppp government in 1977 during this period private sector industrial units in basic industrial sectors including steel and chemicals were nationalized in the name of economic reforms and progress and many civil servants were removed retired on various charges the nationalized units were handed over to the very bureaucracy that was earlier criticized for wrongdoings many of those offering resistance were put behind bars many of these public assets were misused with impunity with irreparable financial loss to the treasury thus started the process of huge losses to public sector enterprises which continues even today the negative results of these actions soon became apparent and the government was forced to revert many units to the private sector to this day it is not clear who the real architect of nationalization was the various steps curbing the private sector initiative and the handing over of industrial and corporate assets resulted in the fall of overall economic growth many entrepreneurs moved abroad and instead of creating new employment opportunities jobs declined to be continued email dr a quadeer khan gmail com

authors jenny d balboa tokyo university of foreign studies and shinji takenaka japan center for economic research during his state visit to china in october 2016 philippine president rodrigo duterte declared his separation of foreign policy from the united states and his intention to follow the ideological path of china and russia the first of many provocative statements against the philippines traditional allies the economic managers of the philippine government sought to assure the international community that despite the president s rhetoric it is still business as usual the foreign economic policy direction of the philippines has not deviated from its previous trajectory trade with the philippines traditional economic partners remains robust despite the duterte s declaration of a foreign policy pivot the united states the european union and japan remain the main economic partners of the philippines in 2018 japan and the united states were the top recipients of philippine exports japan received 17 9 per cent of philippine exports while the united states received 12 3 per cent the european union s share declined slightly from 11 4 per cent in 2016 to 9 7 per cent in 2018 due to asean and other asian countries increasing their export share china s share of philippine exports declined from 12 2 per cent in 2016 to 10 4 per cent in 2018 as a result of the diversification of export partners china remained the third top export destination of the philippines under duterte s term the bilateral trade deficit with china increased comprising 19 6 per cent of philippine imports as of 2018 trade in services remained upbeat for the same period driven by the strong business process outsourcing sector the philippines boasted a 20 per cent growth in services trade from 2017 to 2018 the european union japan and asean remain the top sources of foreign direct investment fdi from 2016 to 2018 fdi from the european union reached us 42 9 million fdi from asean mainly singapore reached us 37 08 million and from japan us 25 4 million fdi from the united states tapered during that period at us 14 million but the united states remains one of the top 10 fdi sources investments coming from china remained small at us 4 6 million compared with the investments from southeast asia japan the european union and the united states for the period cited russia has been a peripheral trade and investment partner despite duterte s statements of strengthening ties with the country the foreign policy pivot did not affect official development assistance oda japan remains the philippines top source of oda providing the philippines a total of us 5 98 billion in loans and grants as of september 2018 the other top five oda sources were the world bank with us 3 13 billion the asian development bank with us 2 24 billion the united states with us 806 billion and south korea with us 659 billion the european union offered us 167 million in grants china delivered us 124 million in loans and grants negotiations for the philippines eu free trade agreement were revived showing a willingness to strengthen ties with the european union the duterte administration continues the previous aquino administration s strategy to build a more competitive manufacturing sector it was implemented in partnership with the united states the european union and japan and is projected to be completed in 2025 the manufacturing sector has grown an average of 7 6 per cent from 2010 2017 duterte has admitted that he is not well versed in economic issues and that he would leave economic matters to the experts technocrats continued programs from the previous administration and pushed unaddressed reforms that have been difficult to implement in the past they have gained a more influential role as was evident in the ratification of the rice trade liberalisation law republic act 11203 in march 2019 the law converted the quantitative restrictions on rice imports into tariffs and limited the regulatory power of the national food authority to import and distribute food aiming to address the chronic seasonal rice shortages of the country deregulation faced strong opposition from the agriculture sector duterte disregarded the plea of the farmers groups ngos and food security advocates they fear that cheap imports will threaten the livelihood of local small scale rice farmers small traders may be weighed down by a few large rice traders who can form rice cartels to arbitrarily control the supply and prices of rice duterte defied governance norms when he appointed budget secretary benjamin diokno as governor of the bangko sentral ng pilipinas on 4 march 2019 this position is traditionally selected from senior career central bankers to preserve its political independence diokno is a seasoned technocrat with a long record of public service but his close ties to duterte and his dovish reputation on fiscal deficit was seen by some analysts as a risk to macroeconomic stability under diokno s watch as budget secretary the fiscal deficit increased in nominal terms 1 percentage point from 2017 to 2018 the economy remained stable because it was growing at more than 6 per cent as long as the gdp growth rate stays at 6 7 per cent the economy will remain stable even with a projected fiscal deficit of 3 2 per cent of the gdp in 2019 one of diokno s first initiatives was to cut interest rates this was to stimulate the economy due to external risks including the us china trade war and economic growth deceleration to 5 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 under a less popular administration this would have been more difficult to implement given its impact on accelerating inflation despite duterte s unpredictable leadership the economy has remained stable enjoying one of the fastest gdp growth rates in asia duterte inherited a strong economy and cash rich government from the previous administration this provided his government with plenty of opportunities to carry out his agenda while expanding reforms initiated by his predecessors the sophisticated technocracy and economic institutions work as anchors of economic resilience and play important roles in cushioning the negative impact of duterte s crass leadership jenny d balboa is a lecturer at the tokyo university of foreign studies tufs shinji

exception was the indian rupee which depreciated despite better than expected headline inflation data prices in india rose 3 18 y y in june versus 3 13 anticipated which was the fastest pace since october 2018 what seemed to drive selling pressure in the currency was subhash chandra garg india s economic affairs secretary who said that thefiscal deficit target for 2020was higher at 3 55 meanwhile the singapore dollar briefly depreciated after singapore s economyunexpectedly contracted by the most since 2012 raising concerns over the outlook for domestic inflation in indonesia the

largest economy contract over 7 percent in usd terms this is more than the 4 6 estimated decline anticipated by economists and speaks to rising concerns about domestic demand in an economy that is shifting towards a consumer oriented powerhouse data results in china are still tending to disappoint relative to economists expectations according to citigroup this opens the door to a softer print in second quarter gdp which is already estimated to slow to 6 2 y y from 6 4 that is the weakest pace of expansion since at least 1992 and this could dampen growth prospects for some of its trading partners nearby such as singapore which is already struggling the philippines malaysia indonesia and singapore all have china as part of their top 5 trading partners the former two countries have already cut interest rates at least once this year to help support economic activity something to keep in mind is that prospects of cheaper credit from the united states can alleviate financial pressure in emerging markets for the time being which may help counter frets over weak chinese growth later in the week the bank of indonesia is expected to reduce its 7 day reverse repo rate from 6

the past decade has been rough for greece after the global financial crisis of 2008 9 the country lost a quarter of its gdp and became the bête noire of europe for nearly catalyzing the implosion of the eurozone roughly four years ago however greece began a quiet recovery under prime minister alexis tsipras and his syriza party the economy inched back to positive growth populist movements lost their momentum and greece s relations with its allies and many of its neighbors improved but tsipras s successes particularly in foreign policy didn t translate into popularity so on july 8 greeks woke up to news that opposition leader kyriakos mitsotakis and his center right new democracy party had defeated tsipras in a landslide yet far from a setback for the country mitsotakis victory gives greeks more reason to be optimistic about the future although tsipras helped catalyze greece s recovery mitsotakis s sweeping electoral mandate and impressive technocratic cabinet suggest that he is in a better position than his predecessor to build on the country s positive momentum much remains to be done to reform the economy and bring back foreign investors but greece s new leadership is poised to turn the page on a decade that most greeks would prefer to forget getting better all the time greece s economic crisis reached its nadir in 2015 that year the poverty rate among pensioners surged to 45 percent and the government nearly ran out of money to pay them while youth unemployment reached 50 percent tsipras then freshly elected threatened to reject the austerity measures that since 2010 heavily indebted greek governments had accepted in exchange for emergency funding from the international monetary fund and european central bank but he ultimately relented accepting his creditors conditions in the summer of 2015 and paving the way for greece to get back on its feet greece s new leadership is poised to turn the page on a decade that most greeks would prefer to forget today the cuts to government wages and other public spending have finally started to pay off greece is beginning to tackle its enormous public debt its primary surplus the difference between government income and spending now hovers around three percent up from negative nine percent in 2013 the greek economy is expected to grow by two percent this year one of the highest rates in europe and unemployment which reached 25 percent in 2015 has fallen to 18 percent investors have taken note major construction projects are now underway in the athenian riviera the city s hitherto neglected waterfront in downtown athens chinese visitors are snatching up cheap real estate under a special visa program that provides residence permits to foreign investors in northern greece energy and infrastructure projects including the construction of the trans adriatic pipeline a 4 5 billion euro gas pipeline from central asia to western europe are creating jobs while enhancing greece s regional standing yields on ten year government bonds are at record lows indicating a return of market trust to the country and the athens stock exchange general index is up roughly 40 percent since the beginning of the year tsipras deserves credit for planting the seeds of this economic recovery the departing prime minister s most important legacy however lies in foreign policy last year tsipras presided over the settlement of greece s 27 year naming dispute with its northern neighbor which as part of a deal with athens agreed to change its name from macedonia to north macedonia the prespa agreement as the deal is known paved the way for north macedonia s ascension to nato in so doing it helped stabilize the balkans and led tsipras and his north macedonian counterpart to be nominated for the nobel peace prize it also positioned greece as a trusted interlocutor for the united states in the balkans and the eastern mediterranean but tsipras diplomatic success came at a cost macedonia denotes both a modern region in northern greece and the ancient homeland of alexander the great a greek national hero many greek voters including those on the conservative right and the extreme left not only feel a sense of historical ownership over the name but fear future territorial encroachment by north macedonia these voters felt betrayed by the prespa agreement which they saw as a sign of weakness on the part of tsipras this sense of betrayal combined with general frustration over the slow pace of economic recovery and the traumatic memory of tsipras mishandling of creditor negotiations in the first six months of 2015 helped lose syriza the election mitsotakis a u s educated reformer has already unveiled an ambitious program to digitize the government attract foreign investment and reform labor relations and education among other priorities in contrast to the previous government his cabinet includes many technocrats with significant experience in the private sector and abroad and unlike syriza which had to partner with a small right wing party in order to form a government new democracy commands an absolute majority giving it more freedom to pursue reforms new democracy also helped edge out the extreme right wing group golden dawn which failed to obtain parliamentary representation mitsotakis task it is now up to mitsotakis to capitalize on these positive trends his top priorities are to loosen up the country s rigid bureaucracy and boost its economy greece remains one of the worst countries in europe to do business and its forbidding levels of taxation keep both investment and talent away the first litmus test for the new government will be whether it is able to take on special interests including entrenched oligarchs and unions in order to liberalize the labor market increase foreign investment and fight corruption mitsotakis will also need to improve public infrastructure and reform greece s justice and educational systems internationally mitsotakis needs to build on the prespa agreement to further boost greece s global standing northern greek businessmen are itching for better market access in the balkans and athens has an opportunity to consolidate its reputation as force for stability in southern europe u s diplomats for instance are increasingly turning to greece as an alternative to turkey to ensure peace and stability in the eastern mediterranean the u s senate is now considering a bill the eastern mediterranean security and energy partnership act that would enhance u s support for the trilateral partnership of greece cyprus and israel around defense and energy cooperation having graduated from its eu bailout program in 2018 greece now has a chance to prove that it can solve rather than just cause problems on the international stage to do so mitsotakis will have to keep the nationalist elements of his party in check in recent years new democracy has moved right in order to protect itself from far right parties such as golden dawn and the pro russian greek solution new democracy has traditionally been skeptical of diversity migration and lgbt rights and its fringe factions toy with nationalism xenophobia and racism in the past mitsotakis has struggled to contain these fringe elements but he is now showing signs of success in a rebuke to the nationalist wing of his party he has pledged to follow the prespa agreement when in office and he managed to keep extremist candidates off the new democracy ballot in the may elections to the european parliament turning over a new leaf europe should also do its part to help greece s recovery berlin and brussels should follow washington s lead and recognize that athens is no longer a problem child ironically for all the talk about the crisis in transatlantic relations the trump administration has engaged greece more effectively than have the europeans in fact greece should be showcased as an eu success story with brussels potentially headed for a showdown with rome over the italian budget this fall greece could offer a positive counterpoint an eu member state that is improving its position on the continent by cooperating with brussels on the eurozone and migration crises and while doing so has triumphed over populist and extremist political forces now brussels should lean on athens to play a positive role in the western balkans where eu leaders have warned of growing chinese and russian influence oil and gas exploration off the shores of greece could also provide opportunities to improve europe s energy independence all of these issues should be front and center at the next meeting between eu and greek leaders a change in leadership both in greece and at the european level provides an opportunity for a fresh start ursula von der leyen jean claude juncker s incoming replacement as president of the european commission should attempt to build positive ties with mitsotakis one way to start would be to make athens one of her first stops upon assuming office mitsotakis election is not only a positive sign for greeks it is cause for optimism about the eu as a whole suggesting that sensible center right forces can beat back populists of both the right and the left yet as encouraging as the election was greece cannot rebuild itself on its own the country s partners in europe and across the west have for the past decade viewed greece as a basket case it is time for them to recognize the country s progress and begin to create a new relationship

in this week s musings earnings season kicks off central bankers new clothes debt ceiling i m baaack trade wars the gift that keeps on giving domestic economy more signs of sputtering stocks what does it all mean it s earnings season next week banks unofficially kick off the june quarter earnings season with expectations set for a 2 6 drop in s p 500 earnings according to factset after a decline of 0 4 in the first quarter of 2019 if the actual earnings for the june quarter end up being a decline it will be the first time the s p 500 has experienced two quarters of declines an earnings recession since 2016 recently the estimates for the third quarter have fallen from 0 2 to 0 3 heading into the second quarter 113 s p 500 companies have issued guidance of these 87 have issued negative guidance with just 26 issuing positive guidance if the number issuing negative guidance does not increase it will be the second highest number since factset began tracking this data in 2006 so not a rosy picture naturally in the post financial crisis bad is good and good is bad world the s p 500 is up nearly 20 in the face of contracting earnings potentially three quarters worth and experienced the best first half of the year since 1997 in the past week both the s p 500 and the dow jones industrial average have closed at record highs as federal reserve chairman powell s testimony before congress gave the market comfort that cuts are on the way this week s stronger than expected cpi and ppi numbers are unlikely to alter their intentions welcome to the world of the central bankers new clothes central bankers new clothes here are a few interesting side effects of those lovely stimulus oriented threads worn in the hallowed halls of the world s major central banks yes you read that right greece the nation that was the very first to default on its debt back in 377bc and has been in default roughly 50 of the time since its independence in 1829 saw the yield on its 10 year drop below the yield on the 10 year us treasury bond but how can that be back to those now rather stretchy stimulus suits worn by the world s central bankers that allow for greater freedom of movement in all aspects of monetary policy in recent weeks we ve seen a waterfall of hints and downright promises to loosen up even more the european central bank the us federal reserve the bank of canada have all gone seriously dovish over in turkey president erdogan fired his central banker for not joining the party serbia australia dominican republic iceland mozambique russia chile azerbaijan india australia sri lanka kyrgyzstan angola jamaica philippines new zealand malaysia rwanda malawi ukraine paraguay georgia egypt armenia and ghana have all cut rates so far this year and quite a few have done so multiple times from september 2018 through the end of 2018 there were 40 rate hikes by central banks around the world and just 3 cuts since the start of 2019 there have been 11 hikes and 38 cuts that s a big shift but why globally the economy is slowing and in the aftermath of the financial crisis a slowing economy is far more dangerous than in years past how s that in the wake of the financial crisis governments around the world set up barriers to protect large domestic companies the central bankers aimed their bazookas at interest rates which mostly as an unintended consequence ended up giving large but weak companies better access to cheap money than smaller but stronger companies this resulted in increasing consolidation which in turn has been shrinking workers share of national income for example the us is currently shutting down established companies and generating new startups at the slowest rates in at least 50 years today much of the developed world faces highly consolidated industries with less competition and innovation one of the reasons we believe our disruptive innovators investing theme is so powerful and record levels of corporate debt it took us corporations 50 years to accumulate 3 trillion in debt in the third quarter of 2003 in the first quarter of 2019 just over 15 years later this figure had more than doubled to 6 4 trillion along with the shrinking workers share of national income we see a shrinking middle class in many of the developed nations which we capitalize on in our middle class squeeze investing theme as one would expect this results in the economy becoming more and more politicized voters aren t happy recessions once considered a normal part of the economic cycle have become something to be avoided at all costs the following chart using data from the national bureau of economic research shows that since the mid 1850s the average length of an economic cycle from trough to peak has been increasing from 26 6 months between 1854 and 1919 to 35 months between 1919 and 1945 to 58 4 months between 1945 and 2009 at the same time the duration of the economic collapse from peak to trough has been shrinking the current trough to potential peak is the longest on record at 121 months great but it is also the second weakest in terms of growth beaten only by the 37 month expansion from october 1945 to november of 1948 why has it been so weak one of the reasons has been the rise of the zombie corporations those that don t earn enough profit to cover their interest payments surviving solely through refinancing part of the reason we ve seen ballooning corporate debt the bank for international settlements estimates that zombie companies today account for 12 of all companies listed on stock exchanges around the world in the united states zombies account for 16 of publicly listed companies up from just 2 in the 1980s this is why central bankers around the world are so desperate for inflation and fear deflation in a deflationary environment the record level of debt would become more and more expensive which would trigger delinquencies defaults and downgrades creating a deflationary cycle that feeds upon itself debtors love inflation for as purchasing power falls so does the current cost of that debt but in a world of large zombie corporations a slowing economy means the gap between profit and interest payments would continue to widen making their survival ever more precarious this economic reality is one of the reasons that nearly 20 of the global bond market has negative yield and 90 trade with a negative real yield which takes inflation into account debt ceiling debate i m baaack while we are on the topic of bonds the bipartisan policy center recently reported that they believe there is a significant risk that the us will breach its debt limit in early september if congress does not act quickly previously it was believed that the spending wall would not be hit until october or november as the beltway gets more and more shall we say raucous this round could unnerve the markets trade wars the gift that keeps on giving aside from the upcoming fun sarcasm of watching congress and the president whack each other around over rising government debt the trade war with china which gave the equity markets a serious pop post the g20 summit on the news that progress was being made is once again looking less optimistic china s commerce minister zhong shan who is considered a hardliner has assumed new prominence in the talks participating alongside vice premier liu he who has headed the chinese team for over a year in talks this week the chinese are obviously aware that with every passing month president trump will feel more pressure to get something done before the 2020 elections and may be looking to see just how hard they can push trade tensions between the us and europe are back on the front page this week senators in france voted to pass a new tax that will impose a 3 charge on revenue for digital companies with revenues of more than â 750 million globally and â 25 million in france this will hit roughly 30 companies including apple aapl facebook fb amazon amzn and alphabet googl as well as some companies from germany spain the uk and france the trump administration was not pleased and has launched a probe into the french tax to determine if it unfairly discriminates against us companies this could lead to the us imposing punitive tariffs on french goods not to be outdone the uk is planning to pass a similar tax that would impose a 2 tax on revenues from search engine social media and e commerce platforms whose global revenues exceed â 500 million and whose uk revenue is over â 25 million this tax which so far appears to affect us companies disproportionately is likely to raise additional ire at a time when the us uk relationship is already on shaky ground over leaked cables from the uk s ambassador that were less than complimentary about president trump and his administration that s just this week is it any wonder the dhl global trade barometer is seeing a contraction in global trade according to morgan stanley research just under two thirds of countries have purchasing manager indices below 50 which is contraction territory and further warning signs of slowing global growth this week also saw basf se otcqx basfy the world s largest chemical company warn that the weakening global economy could cut its profits by 30 this year domestic economy more signs of sputtering the ism manufacturing index weakened again in june and has been declining now for 10 months the new orders component which as its name would imply is more forward looking is on the cusp of contracting it has been declining since december 2017 and is at the lowest level since august 2016 back in 2016 the us experienced a bit of an industrial sector mini recession that was tempered in its severity by housing recall that back then we saw two consecutive quarters of decline in s p 500 earnings today overall construction is in contraction with total construction spending down 2 3 year over year residential construction has been shrinking year over year for 8 months and in may was down 11 2 year over year commercial construction is even worse down 13 7 year over year in may and has been steadily declining since december 2016 what helped back in 2016 is of no help today while the headlines over the employment data excepting adp s report last week have sounded rather solid we have seen three consecutive downward revisions to employment figures in recent months that s the type of thing you see as the data is rolling over the challenger gray christmas job cuts report found that employer announced cuts ytd through may were 39 higher than the same period last year and we are heading into the 12th consecutive month of year over year increases in job cuts again that is indicative of a negative shift in employment stocks what does it all mean currently us stock prices as measured by the price to sales ratio because earnings are becoming less and less meaningful on a comparative basis thanks to all the share buybacks exceed what we saw in the late 1999s and early 2000s with all that central bank supplied liquidity is it any wonder things are pricey on top of that the s p 500 share count has declined to a 20 year low as us companies spent over 800 million on buybacks in 2018 and are poised for a new record in 2019 based on q1 activity overall the number of publicly listed companies has fallen by 50 over the past 20 years and the accelerating pace of stock buybacks has made corporations the largest and only significant net buyer of stocks for the past 5 years central bank stimulus on top of fewer shares to purchase has overpowered fundamentals this week some of the major indices once again reached record highs and given the accelerating trend in central bank easing this is likely to continue for some time but investors beware understand that these moves are not based on improving earnings so it isn t about the business fundamentals at least when we talk about equity markets in aggregate as there is always a growth story to be found somewhere regardless of the economy but rather about the belief the central bank stimulus will continue to push share prices higher keep in mind that the typical federal reserve rate cut cycle amounts to cuts of on average 525 basis points today the fed has only about half of that with which to work with before heading into negative rate territory the stimulus coming from most of the world s major and many of the minor central banks likely will push the major averages higher until something shocks the market and it realizes there really are no new clothes what exactly that shock will be possibly the upcoming debt ceiling debates trade wars or intensifying geological tensions is impossible to know with certainty today but something that cannot go on forever won t editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
the proportion of south african output going to china for instance has shot up from 2 in the mid 2000s to 15 now according to a study by the mckinsey global institute additionally china consumes 45 of the democratic republic of congo s exports 33 of australia s and 24 of south korea s according to united nations data cited in the mckinsey report emerging market countries are also increasingly dependent on chinese investment china accounts for 13 of foreign direct investment including corporate mergers and new factories in egypt up from 1 in the mid 2000s and 8 of pakistan s up from 2 researchers at j p morgan have estimated that if china s annual growth slows to 4 5 by the end of the next decade as they expect global metals prices will plunge 40 to 60 ihs markit foresees world economic growth slowing this year to 2 8 from 3 2 in 2018 a decelerating china is certainly part of that said sara johnson ihs executive director for global economics but the world faces other problems too for one thing trump s tariffs on imports from a host of countries and the retaliation they have drawn from america s trading partners are crimping world trade and investment manufacturers worldwide are also sitting on unsold stockpiles of goods and growth will likely slow as they pare their inventories johnson said trump and president xi jinping agreed last month to resume negotiations

monrovia amid the rapid devaluation of the liberian dollars and the increase in prices of commodities the executive governor of the central bank of liberia nathaniel patray has called for a concerted effort among key government agencies to tackle the country s economic problems according to governor patray based on projected global and domestic economic indicators the liberian dollar is expected to face further pressure during 2019 2020 unless are strong policy measures including monetary policy fiscal policy and structural reforms are implemented this calls for policy coordination and synergy among key government agencies ministry of finance and development planning ministry of commerce and industry and central bank of liberia he said speaking when he launched the inaugural session of the cbl s monthly economic forum cblmef recently governor patray stated that since he took over the leadership of the bank in june 2018 the cbl has been working actively as part of the technical economic management team temt to address the prevailing economic challenges especially the exchange rate and inflation situation he revealed that the bank did achieve stability in the exchange rate between july and december 2018 due to intervention in the fx markets however he said the gain has been reversed mainly due to uncertainty triggered by negative publicity about alleged missing l 16 billion and the us 25 0 million mop up exercise growth is expected to slow the liberian economy while inflationary pressure remains in sight as the liberian dollar weakens with inflation rates in double digits beyond 20 percent developments in the liberian economy for the medium term 2019 2024 he added are expected to be largely influenced by global economic developments which are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty slow growth in a number of economies tightening financial conditions debt distress and most importantly the ongoing trade tension between the usa and china real gdp growth is projected at 0 4 percent in 2019 from an estimated of 1 2 percent in 2018 while the projection in 2018 was revised from 3 2 percent to 1 2 percent due mainly to a slowdown in economic activity unfavorable terms of trade for primary commodities and higher global fuel prices speaking further he noted that forecast of economic activity reflects weak performances in production consumption and monetary conditions and in addition to constrained prices of the country s major export commodities economic activity remained subdued during q1 2019 from an initial weaker position in the last two quarters mainly driven by declines in consumers spending and production according to him the liberian dollar has witnessed a double digit depreciation year on year from march 2018 to march 2019 he noted the liberian dollar depreciated by 23 72 percent on average while the end of period exchange rate showed depreciation of 23 86 percent he added that since mid april 2019 the liberian dollar has come under significant pressure with the average exchange rate depreciating by 6 5 percent between december 31 2018 and april 23 2019 causes of depreciation according to the cbl executive governor key factors that underpin the latest wave of depreciation pressure include low supply of foreign exchange in the economy even though net remittances inflows remain positive net inflows of personal remittances as at end april 2019 showed a 28 9 percent decline year on year while the net of total flows declined by 33 0 percent other factors responsible for the continuous depreciation the country s currency include the high demand for foreign exchange to facilitate import payments as the july 26 festive period approaches current account deficit due to deteriorating terms of trade as evidenced by weak export earnings capital deficit due to decline in foreign direct investment the lingering effect of unmil departure scale down in the activities of some international non governmental organizations ingos in the economy and low budget support inflation and its causes giving further statistics on the state of the economy governor patray outlined that inflation trended downward in q1 2019 to 22 8 percent from 28 4 percent in q4 2018 he asserted that inflation remains high above long term trend far above the ecowas convergence criterion of single digit mainly due to exchange rate depreciation and structural issues forecast of inflation for q2 2019 though slightly high is below the 22 8 percent recorded in march 2019 on account of favorable commodity prices however inflation is expected to rise beginning the last month of the quarter due to likely depreciation of the liberian dollar as a result of increased demand for foreign currency he outlined that sources of inflationary pressure include the pass through effect of the depreciation of the liberian dollar due to a relatively high liberian dollar liquidity about 92 percent of currency outside the bank the high dependence of liberia on import commodities over 80 percent which puts high demand on foreign exchange surcharges on petroleum products arbitrage practices by some businesses for profiteering and infrastructural challenges high energy and utility costs according to the cbl boss are all sources of inflation concerted efforts needed while calling for concerted policy coordination and synergy among key government agencies including the ministry of finance and development planning ministry of commerce and industry and central bank of liberia to tackle the country s economic problems executive governor patray noted that the cbl remains committed to promoting price stability as its principal objective executive governor patray based on projected global and domestic economic indicators the liberian dollar is expected to face further pressure during 2019 2020 unless there are strong policy measures including monetary policy fiscal policy and structural reforms are implemented this calls for policy coordination and synergy among key government agencies ministry of finance and development planning ministry of commerce and industry and central bank of liberia he mentioned that the bank s policies are geared toward contractionary tightening monetary policy to achieve its goal he sated the bank has introduced several monetary policy instruments under its new monetary policy framework including but not limited to sale of cbl indexed bills standing deposit facility and standing credit facility in addition the executive governor indicated that the cbl continues to implement the remittance split policy rsp as the key instrument for building the gross international reserves gir for the purpose of withstanding unexpected external shocks to the economy

continued this quarter demonstrated our asset driven mentality as we generated high quality assets while leveraging our retail banking footprint to grow core deposit funding the company experienced significant loan growth in the quarter as total loans grew by 1 1 billion and the yield on loans remained relatively flat to the prior quarter additionally the loan growth was diversified across various loan portfolios as we experienced growth of 380 million of commercial premium finance receivables 303 million of commercial real estate loans and 277 million of commercial loans total deposits increased by 714 million in the current quarter although the rate on interest bearing deposits increased by eight basis points we remain aggressive in growing quality assets that meet our standards and will seek to fund that by expanding deposit market share and household penetration mr wehmer noted our mortgage banking business production increased dramatically in the current quarter as loan volumes originated for sale increased to 1 2 billion from 678 million in the first quarter of 2019 the favorable increase in origination volume was a result of the seasonal purchase market combined with increased refinance activity due to the declining interest rate environment declining long term interest rates also contributed to a 4 1 million reduction in our mortgage servicing rights portfolio related to payoffs and paydowns as well as a 3 4 million reduction due to changes in fair value assumptions net of hedging gain however those declines were more than offset by capitalization of retained servicing rights of 9 8 million in the current quarter we continue to focus on efficiencies in our delivery channels and our operating costs in our mortgage banking area we believe that the mortgage rate outlook bodes well for mortgage origination demand in future quarters commenting on credit quality mr wehmer stated during the current quarter the company recorded 24 6 million of provision for credit losses and 22 3 million of net charge offs of which 15 2 million of provision for credit losses and 18 4 million of net charge offs related to three credits this contributed to a four basis point reduction in non performing loans as a percent of total loans to 0 45 the company recorded additional provision expense during the current quarter in recognition of the significant loan growth as well as certain specific reserves on other non performing loans we believe that the company s reserves remain appropriate and we remain diligent in our review of credit we do not believe that the charges taken during the current quarter represent any pervasive issues that may have broader implications on the credit quality of our loan portfolio turning to the future mr wehmer stated we have experienced significant franchise growth in the first two quarters of 2019 and believe that our opportunities for both internal and external growth remain consistently strong total period end loans exceeded total average loans by 751 million in the current quarter providing momentum for an increase in net interest income in the third quarter of 2019 despite market conditions that are applying pressure to the net interest margin we plan to continue to emphasize core deposit growth and we will remain diligent in monitoring the interest rate environment to ensure that we react quickly in adjusting deposit pricing in the event of further interest rate reductions we plan to continue in our steady and measured approach to achieve our main objectives of growing franchise value increasing profitability leveraging our expense infrastructure and continuing to increase shareholder value evaluating strategic acquisitions like the oak bank acquisition and the announced acquisition of stc bancshares corp and organic branch growth will continue to be a part of our overall growth strategy with the goal of becoming chicago s bank and wisconsin s bank the graphs below

18 for additional information on this performance ratio table 9 interest rate sensitivity as an ongoing part of its financial strategy the company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income management measures its exposure to changes in interest rates by modeling many different interest rate scenarios the following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one year time horizon assuming increases of 100 and 200 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points the static shock scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static i e no growth or constant balance sheet conversely the ramp scenario results incorporate management s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual parallel change in market rates over twelve months actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies the interest rate sensitivity for both the static shock and ramp scenario is as follows static shock scenario 200 basis points 100 basis points 100 basis points june 30 2019 17 3 8 9 10 2

more than ten years on from the global financial crisis and economies around the world are still struggling to fully recover the latest data is not promising international institutions such as the oecd imf and world bank have all recently downgraded their growth forecasts for the current and upcoming year compared to just a year ago all major economies are now expected to grow significantly slower than what was previously expected for the us the phasing out of donald trump s tax cuts will negatively affect the economy and the global trade war is starting to weigh down on the global economy with some major exporting countries like germany and japan being affected the most more importantly one of the most accurate recession indicators known as the yield curve has recently been flashing warning signs every postwar recession in the us was preceded by an inversion of the yield curve meaning that long term interest rates had fallen below short term interest rates some 12 to 18 months before the outset of the economic downturn there are many different interest rates in the economy in general the interest rate must reflect the riskiness of the borrower and the type of investment that is carried out the time structure of the loan also matters governments issue debt with very different maturities from short term treasury bills in the us that mature within one year or less to long term bonds which can have maturities of two years to 30 years some countries like france and spain even have government bonds with a duration of 50 years usually interest rates on long term bonds are higher than interest rates on short term bonds leading to an upward sloping yield curve this is because investors need to be compensated for the extra risk they bear when investing in long term securities but interest rates are also determined by expectations during economic booms interest rates usually tend to rise if investors expect interest rates to be higher in the future then this will be reflected in long term interest rates since this is simply an average of the expected path of future short term interest rates alternatively if investors expect interest rates to fall in the future long term interest rates might already fall below short term interest rates right now in that case the so called yield curve inverts and is downward sloping accurate predictor historically an inverted yield curve has been one of the most accurate recession predictors low interest rates tend to be an indicator of low growth prospects and low inflation expectations both signs of an upcoming economic downturn if the yield curve slopes down investors therefore usually expect a slowing economy it might also indicate that investors expect the central bank to lower rates in the future in order to prevent an upcoming recession central banks have a history though of reacting far too timidly to upcoming economic troubles to paraphrase the economist rüdiger dornbusch expansions don t die of old age every single one of them was murdered by the federal reserve the fed in the us and other central banks have historically found themselves behind the curve and tend to do too little too late as was the case during the great recession that started in 2008 yield curves have now inverted in the us in australia canada and a number of other advanced economies even in countries where short term rates are already at zero like in japan and germany long term rates have fallen into more negative territory this has led to the bizarre situation where investors basically pay those countries a premium for holding their government bonds while an inverted yield curve does not guarantee a future economic downturn the economic outlook has worsened substantially in recent months some economists though have suggested the yield curve inversion is not an accurate predictor of an upcoming recession anymore they reason that measures by central banks and other economic fundamentals make the current yield curve inversion benign however as a rule of thumb we should be extremely wary of the idea that this time is different when history tells us it usually is not indeed similar stories were told just before the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s and before the housing bubble collapsed a few years later in fact nobel laureate paul krugman suggests that the current yield curve inversion is actually much more dangerous than in the past because interest rates are depressed and stuck at historically low levels across the globe in the past the fed has cut rates by some 5 or more in order to fight an upcoming recession but this is not an option this time around since interest rates are already so low in most advanced economies a brief thread on the yield curve as you may have heard long term us interest rates are now slightly below short term rates this doesn t happen often and as far as i can tell each previous instance has been followed by recession 1 pic twitter com uq7yjr3jwa paul krugman paulkrugman march 25 2019 this is why the economist larry summers argues that the fed should cut interest rates by at least 0 5 immediately as recession insurance to boost the economy before it s too late both the european central bank and the fed have monetary policy meetings at the end of this month investors are anticipating that both will cut interest rates in order to fight the recent weak economic data in fact these interest rate cuts are already priced into financial markets which is one of the reasons for why the yield curve has inverted globally ecb president mario draghi also hinted at a research conference that the ecb is willing to resume its quantitative easing stimulus programme if the eurozone s economic data deteriorates further and the ecb s new chief economist phillip lane recently said that the ecb can cut its benchmark rate already at 0 4 into even deeper negative territory the world s two major central banks are therefore expected to add new rounds of stimulus very soon despite global interest rates still being depressed at historically low levels while these policies are worrisome to some this kind of action is arguably the only thing that has kept the global economy afloat in recent years stay tuned for further central bank action we need it to prevent another recession julius probst is a doctoral

5 colouring the spare capacity issue as such again the stand out issue in the minutes will be what the rba says about the stubborn issue of spare capacity the thing right now that stands in the way of its objective of restoring price growth decreasing the unemployment rate and driving overall economic growth the question can be distilled as such does the rba think that another rate cut is necessary in order to achieve these goals or are current interest rate conditions sufficient enough it s been the perennial concern for the central bank and will likely remain so until the unemployment hits the 4 5 per cent it identifies as signifying full employment 6 rates markets suggest volatility possible in the minds of financial market participants the answer is skewed towards the need for another rate cut as it stands the market has baked in a 70 75 per cent chance of another cut by the rba by december before that meeting the implied probability of a cut is generally less than a fifty fifty chance it creates scope for volatility around future australian economic events as traders adjust to the new market trends being shaped by the introduction of stimulus in the economy the aussie dollar will therefore be the centre of trader attention especially as the currency attempts a foray higher courtesy of a depreciating us dollar 7 us retail sales to eventually steal the show and that dynamic will soon come under scrutiny too meaning the markets attention on the rba may prove fleeting us retail sales are released tonight with economists forecasting a paltry 0 1 per cent expansion in sales for the us economy last month us consumption is trending lower and is expected to continue trending lower in the intermediate future as the economic cycle unwinds considering consumption comprises nearly 70 per cent of us gdp and we are approaching a crucial us fed meeting in two weeks tonight s data will inform considerably the path of future fed cuts and by extension the fortunes of the dollar and global stocks 8 market watch asx futures down 9 points or 0 1 to 6588 at 7am aud 0 3 to 70 39 us cents on wall st dow 0 1 s p 500 flat nasdaq 0 2 in new york bhp 1 1 rio 1 3 atlassian 0 7 in europe stoxx 50 0 1 ftse 0 3 cac 0 1 dax 0 5 spot gold 0 3 to us1412 09 at 2 10pm brent crude 0 3 to us66 50 a barrel us oil 1 to us59 62 a barrel iron ore 1 8 to us121 41 a tonne dalian iron ore 3 9 to 918 5 yuan lme aluminium 1 1 at us1842 a tonne lme copper 0 8 up at us5983 a tonne 2 year yield us 1 84 australia 0 99 5 year yield us 1 85 australia 1 06 10 year yield us 2 09 australia 1 45 germany 0 26 10 year us australia yield gap near 4 15am aest 64 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
a look at the day ahead from european economics and politics editor mark john and emea markets editor mike dolan the views expressed are their own london july 15 reuters it s a busy day for european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels today with the 2015 nuclear deal with iran close to collapse they must somehow try to work out how to convince iran and the united states to dial down the tension and start some kind of dialogue the main goal of today s talks will be to show eu unity and make it clear to a sceptical iran that it is not too late for it to come back in line if iran wasn t enough the ministers will also weigh in on the cyprus energy row with a move to curb contacts and funding for ankara in retaliation for what the eu says is turkey s illegal drilling for gas and oil

economy a survey conducted three times a year by ihs markit showed italy s business confidence at a one year high with optimism regarding future activity employment and capital expenditure all rising from the previous survey in february behind the optimism could be a recent plunge in borrowing costs thanks to a deal with the european commission to avert a clash over italy s public finances plus

facebook s proposed new cryptocurrency libra the subject of hearings just now in washington is designed like a classic currency from the colonial period of history anyone presenting a unit of specified foreign exchange will get a proportional unit of libra for example one dollar might get one libra one euro 1 1 libras 66 indian rupees one libra and so on based on the price libra advertises in various global currencies in the archetypical monetary arrangement of the colonial period in the hundred years prior to the second world war colonial currencies were available at a set rate to anyone presenting the british pound sterling getty this practice came to be known as a currency board it fits the libra proposal to a t the idea under colonialism was that an independent local currency might not have very wide purchase even in its own area it might be overprinted unrecognizable to many economic agents and preferred less than more major currencies the way to guarantee the local currency was to make handing over the pound or in places the dollar the french franc or gold the only way of getting it the currency board accepted the pound in exchange for the local currency unit and vice versa internally that unit was accepted as the pound would be externally one returned the local unit to the currency board and got the globally accepted pound on demand and automatically it was precisely the high degree of automaticity of the currency boards that won over the public under a currency board a local currency was automatically equivalent to the dominant global currency the pound furthermore no central bank at the local currency level was called for all monetary production proceeded from the presentation of foreign exchange at the currency board the main effect came in terms of investment investors piled into currency board areas on the understanding that returns would come in the world s top currency the economic results were increases in opportunities and prosperity there was a devil in the details a currency board necessarily collected a large amount of pound sterling a pile of the best currency has its temptations namely for the local potentate to abscond with it whatever the effects on the local issue from that point forward with every success of a currency board came a greater temptation to abrogate the whole thing and pocket the foreign exchange the colonial context was therefore essential to the functioning of currency boards if ever a local currency board made off with british pounds britain itself could mete out punishments these might include applying british law to the offending party denying the convertibility of local notes freezing out the area from imperial trade preferences and pressing british power and prerogatives at the expense of local authorities such potential sanctions were enough to keep the currency board reserves intact and untouched indeed they were often held in britain itself this drove the point home no touching these things modern currency boards those that persisted or arose after 1945 lacked the oversight that faded with decolonization the guarantees of the high quality foreign exchange stashes of currency boards had to come if at all in different forms the most successful modern currency board area is hong kong which has maintained a u s dollar currency board for decades hong kong has a fantastic incentive not to raid its dollar stash hong kong is one of the very richest and freest places in the world and a shining example of what its immense neighbor china might aspire to be raiding its currency board reserves would amount to self mutilation on heroic scale other examples though follow a different course argentina has operated with a dollar based currency board after periods of success though the temptation has proven too great for certain challenged argentine leaders not to liquidate the reserves inevitably the reserve raids fund vote buying schemes suggestive of juan perón s diminution of the country s immense gold stock of the world war ii era for just that purpose argentina is not part of a colonial structure because such things now belong to the ages so it nominally gets away with this sort of behavior the pale shadow of colonial watchfulness is the international monetary fund created as it was in 1944 on the expectation of decolonization argentina has no problem taking on an international organization paper tiger on the order of the imf the british empire at its apogee the imf certainly is not currency boards really worked under colonialism in modern times they work according to the widely varying local levels of determination that they work facebook s libra consortium aspires to be a currency board accepting all sorts of high level foreign exchange the requirements and problems that come with currency boards are still there in this case obviously there is no imperial structure mandating that the libra currency board work this is no small matter given that this was the secret to the superior functioning of currency boards during their high season conceivably there is a substitute in the rule of law libra is based in geneva switzerland and promises to warehouse its reserves across important places in the developed world this confers a strong sense that any attempt to make off with reserves on the part of the libra partnership would face the brunt of the developed world s contract and larceny laws yet if libra succeeds its owners should be paid and perhaps getting paid will be misconstrued as larceny if libra really succeeds its reserves will be phenomenally large perhaps much larger than any other corporate or personal fortune ever seen there is no extant legal structure even in the leading members of the advanced world that has had to deal with that kind of scale of monetary ownership governments might get jealous they are supposed to be the ones they tell themselves with the final claim on financial resources this knotty problem might be seen as introducing the reverse of the classical currency board problem the major nations might want to get their hands on the libra reserve central banks are prepared to act along these lines as a matter of course if say libra were required to keep a fraction of its reserves with the federal reserve and the current hearings are giving this impression by that institution s authority it could up reserve requirements tantamount to confiscating libra s holdings this would represent a warping of the colonial precedent here major countries would prevent peripheral organizations from taking advantage of the global acceptability of their currencies colonial currency boards sought to do the opposite to guarantee peripheral issues by making them equivalents of things like the pound and the dollar libra runs a clear risk of having the sovereigns of its reserve asset issues raid those issues in the face of such a prospect we could do with a dash of colonialism again of noblesse oblige of letting people do good things with the dollar the euro etc if they are able libra amounts to a major currency exchange traded fund like bitcoin before it which emulates gold libra is emulating currency boards it is uncanny how the paradigmatic industries of the twenty first century in technology and computer science are marking out the nature of the currency systems of the past against official bewilderment that there is any need for such a thing
the introduction of the zimbabwe dollar zw through statutory instrument si 142 has generated a great deal of debate with some arguing on the legality of the si itself which i have little knowledge of but i can at least comment on its economic and political substance the introduction of the zimbabwe dollar zw through statutory instrument si 142 has generated a great deal of debate with some arguing on the legality of the si itself which i have little knowledge of but i can at least comment on its economic and political substance the chief argument being used now to attack the new currency is that there is lack of confidence this is understandable because of the 2008 crisis where the government resorted to printing money when there was no production resulting in hyperinflation like never seen before the question then is how do we restore confidence the simple answer is by avoiding the mistakes of the past which although the government still has a lot to do is now evident as seen by the budget surpluses since the start of the year it has been painful especially with the 2 intermediated money transfer tax economists blame inflation of money supply but this time the cause of inflation was cost push driven by a speculative exchange rate and almost everything was now being priced by an exchange rate factor as the government has now done fiscal consolidation let us keep checks on government spending so that 2008 era is not repeated in particular parliament should play its oversight role through the parliamentary portfolio committee on public finance with the treasury itself respecting the constitutional debt limit in dealing with the issue of public confidence is the emotive issue of corruption and the government as the authorities has to lead the process and by example we read every day of corruption cases in parastatals and everywhere we have also seen the auditor general s audit reports exposing shocking cases and non adherence to corporate governance tenets in the local authorities as well as government ministries that should be stopped and the culprits made accountable the big question is what use are we making of the audit reports if the culprits are not being made accountable we should begin to see arrests prosecutions and convictions if the government is to be taken seriously by the people but there is also corruption in the private sector which has to be dealt with by upholding good tenets of corporate governance responsible behaviour is also needed a good example is the impact of fuel cost on the pricing of goods and services so when fuel price increases by 100 it does not mean that prices of everything goes up by the same factor because fuel is not the only cost by performing a costing model one can discover that unit cost of a unit produced only goes up by say 30 so there is no reason at all to justify huge prices increases in line with the fuel price increase some businesses are fair in their pricing model yet some are bent on profiteering we should all be responsible during this time because the consumer will not forget when normalcy returns and those businesses won t survive we should be guided by the notion that the consumer is king it may be a sellers market now but in the long run the consumer will rule the latest pronouncement by the government banning the multi currency currency can encourage exports dollarisation had put us in a mentality that the us dollar could be obtained locally yet obtaining the us locally just meant a company would have solved its own problems but what about national problems so production has to be supported starting with agriculture and then the whole value chain it is sad that even when we had good rains our agricultural output was low we have to return to exporting horticulture to the netherlands and our good beef to the european market we need creativity and innovation so that we don t spend the little available foreign currency on importing things like toothpicks when there is production money printing becomes a function of the underlying economic activities zimbabwe is at the moment mostly a nation of speculation just buying and selling which does not achieve economic growth or development if a buys shares today on the stockmarket and makes a gain in three days that is just a s gain at the expense of someone else but there is no contribution to the country s gross domestic product in these times of trouble we should see real business leaders constantly innovating to produce for the export market we should also strive for efficient allocation of the foreign currency forex finance minister mthuli ncube correctly noted that zimbabwe has no forex shortage but it was being wired outside the formal system changing hands on the parallel market so when banks have to allocate forex we should see that done according to priorities a company importing raw materials for local production or medicines should be given priority over things like school fees holidays and other non essentials unless the applicant is generating forex we cannot continue to take credit lines and consume forex we have not yet earned we will get into a debt trap and put a burden on the future generation zimbabwe is not poor but rich we have so much which if used economically the nation would double its growth and improve quality of lives crucially let s not continue to dwell in the past of the 2008 era but work for the future and let the mistakes of 2008 not be repeated we can all play a role in making zimbabwe better former united states president john f kennedy put it nicely and i quote we are not here to curse the darkness but to light the candle that guides us through darkness to a safe and sane future so let us not

this article is more than 4 years old getty the senate banking committee staff reached out last week regarding facebook s libra project pursuant to my recent forbes com article during a conference call they indicated interest in receiving formal written testimony from me here it is a pdf version with citations is available here july 15 2019 sen mike crapo chairman sen sherrod brown ranking member united states senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs washington d c 20510 re examining facebook s proposed digital currency and data privacy considerations july 16 2019 hearing dear chairman crapo and ranking member brown i appreciate the opportunity to submit the following statement for your consideration and would like to thank you and the members of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs my background spans both the traditional financial system and digital assets as i spent 22 years on wall street most recently as managing director and head of morgan stanley s pension solutions business in new york until 2016 and have been involved with digital assets for nearly 7 years presently i serve on the wyoming blockchain task force as a gubernatorial appointee and am co founder of the wyoming blockchain coalition which is continuing to build a welcoming framework for the digital asset industry s regulatory compliance i am purely a volunteer in both roles this testimony is my own and should not be construed to represent the views of either organization the libra project is shining light on outdated u s financial regulations that are a holding back the u s economy and b giving rise to the concept of digital currency stablecoins in the first place digital currencies are the first major innovation in payment systems in nearly five decades it is imperative that the u s tread carefully on this matter since the genie is out of the bottle digital currencies cannot be uninvented and they offer significantly more efficient payment systems relative to those of the status quo if we fight this technological trend the innovation will simply move offshore rather than die digital currencies such as that of libra can fit within a regulatory compliant framework in the u s today the state of wyoming has created a comprehensive regulatory compliant framework for digital assets by enacting 13 trailblazing laws one of which may be particularly relevant for the facebook discussion because it creates a special purpose bank charter this new type of bank is authorized to custody digital assets and is required to comply with all federal anti money laundering and related laws as discussed further below wyoming s suite of laws clearly demonstrate to congress that it is possible to create a common sense regulatory framework that can keep blockchain innovation in the u s while also strengthening both legal certainty and consumer protection in this space however the libra project also poses two major policy issues for congress to consider privacy and federal reserve interest payments congress should be concerned about potential abuse of consumer financial privacy by both businesses and governments additionally the project raises the question whether the federal reserve s interest on excess reserves ioer program should be available to facebook s project whether directly or indirectly especially since the bank of england recently announced it will open its interest bearing deposit program to technology companies including the libra project below i expand on these four main points 1 how outdated financial regulations caused the creation of stablecoins which brought us to this juncture 2 that digital currencies are the first major innovation in the payment system in decades 3 that a model for how to fix u s federal regulations exists and it can be found in wyoming s new blockchain laws and 4 that congress should be concerned about two particular issues pertaining to facebook s project privacy and federal reserve interest payments facebook s libra project is shining light on outdated u s financial regulations that are holding back the u s economy and which gave rise to stablecoins in the first place banks have largely shunned the digital currency industry making it difficult if not impossible for investors to trade u s dollars and digital currencies back and forth if they could investors would use the traditional banking system to do this just as they do when trading stocks or commodities back and forth with dollars but the traditional banking system has almost entirely blocked them so out of necessity the digital currency industry responded by inventing a stablecoin a digital currency backed by dollars held in trust whose trades settle on payment rails that are far more efficient than those of the traditional banking system but which is also inextricably linked to the traditional banking system so if congress wants to make stablecoins irrelevant including libra it can easily do so simply by allowing the banking system to consistently bank this new asset class stablecoins are one of many unintended consequences of congressional policies that turned access to the financial system into a policy tool to solve certain problems but as an unintended side effect also created major barriers to lawful commerce when you create barriers to commerce you get less commerce these barriers are one of the reasons why economic growth is sluggish in the united states why are we happy with 3 growth when we regularly hit 5 growth not so long ago to address the conditions that gave rise to stablecoins in the first place congress should remove reputation risk as a factor in banks camels score bank examiners in washington d c should not have the power to punish banks for serving customers that the examiners deem to be high reputation risk a subjective standard that is too easily abused including reputation risk in bank examinations has led to the unintended consequence of de risking a term referring to banks withdrawing access to the u s banking system for high risk customers which has caused entire countries and lawful industries to lose access in addition the policy of requiring reputation risk assessments gave rise to operation choke point from 2013 17 where certain government officials abused these regulations to force banks to withdraw banking access for dozens of politically disfavored but lawful industries including the digital currency industry many members of this committee have attempted to reverse operation choke point but its effects linger on frankly as long as reputation risk is part of bank examinations specifically the camels score it s simply not worthwhile for banks to serve industries that a bank examiner might subjectively deem high reputation risk this policy has reduced lawful commerce in the u s and congress should fix it stop weaponizing the u s financial system the u s dollar is the world s reserve currency this means financial services are cheaper to americans and this is sometimes referred to as an exorbitant privilege yet history has shown that no reserve currency status has ever lasted forever a reserve currency must be usable to keep its status and policies that restrict access make it less usable for lawful commerce when u s policymakers threaten to withdraw access to the u s banking system such as the u s treasury department did on may 7 2019 when it threatened europe for creating instex as a payment system alternative to swift the usefulness of the u s dollar as a reserve currency diminishes such restrictions and threats increase the incentive for users to seek alternatives as insurance against the catastrophic scenario being blocked from the u s banking system and like it or not digital currencies are a viable alternative again the genie is out of the bottle digital currencies will not be uninvented the u s dollar would be better served by allowing our banking system to embrace digital currencies rather than shunning them which is merely driving the innovators offshore roll back not ratchet up compliance requirements the last gao study of criminal conviction rates involving the bank secrecy act found that banks filed 16 million suspicious activity reports sars and the irs achieved 296 convictions for a paltry conviction rate of 0 002 that study is admittedly old from 2006 but it raises the same question i began asking as i observed the huge increase in compliance obligations before leaving wall street in 2016 what are these gigantic compliance costs achieving really and at what cost every compliance requirement is a barrier to both unlawful and lawful commerce and should be weighed not only against its explicit costs but also against its unseen costs e g lawful commerce that didn t happen but would have happened if the artificial barriers did not exist there s an easy way to block all money laundering tax evasion and terrorism financing simply block all financial transactions but seriously congress should consider the appropriate balance moreover while the bank secrecy act was upheld as constitutional in 1976 by the supreme court in the united states v miller case its massive expansion since then may not survive a more recent constitutional challenge this is especially true in light of the carpenter v united states decision of 2018 in which the supreme court narrowed the third party doctrine it initially created in the miller case there s nothing unconstitutional about congress passing unconstitutional laws but when such laws also impose gigantic compliance costs achieve only a paltry 0 002 conviction rate and erect real barriers to economic growth congress should seriously reconsider the whole approach digital currencies are the first major innovation in payment systems in nearly 50 years it is imperative that the u s tread carefully fighting the trend will send innovation offshore rather than kill it no one should be surprised that a new more efficient type of payment system has garnered serious interest because we can mail packages around the world faster than we can send money around the world the status quo payment system coddles inefficient incumbents while imposing costs on businesses to retain comfort deposits in their bank accounts to fund their unsettled payments such comfort deposits trap massive amounts of capital and are a drag on economic growth that i estimate amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars of gdp annually it makes zero sense that companies with a high cost of capital must trap their expensive capital in bank accounts simply because cross border payments take so long to settle such businesses have strong economic incentives to use the most efficient payment system and if necessary these businesses will go offshore to find it congress should stop allowing the federal reserve to protect the incumbent payment system and instead open it to healthy competition many banks have tried to fix the slumbering payment system and some are attempting to create their own blockchain based alternative systems but regulatory barriers have slowed the progress of these projects to a crawl comparatively one such example is fnality formerly known as utility settlement coin which is making progress but is already nearly four years old how does facebook libra fit into this the basic building blocks of facebook s project are not new with only one exception the project is functionally akin to a money market fund the libra association plus a payment network calibra wallet except that its transactions settle on a new type of payment system the money market fund libra association invests in a basket of global currencies government bonds and bank deposits the payment network calibra wallet is akin to a global version of paypal or venmo the only difference again is that transactions in libra settle on a new type of payment system one that is far more efficient than any status quo payment system it should surprise no one that there s demand for a more efficient payment system already the u s has lost the libra association to switzerland which has a more welcoming regulatory regime for blockchain projects than the u s this too should surprise no one yet regarding this payment innovation point there is one aspect of the libra project into which congress should delve deeply facebook announced plans to keep libra 100 backed by financial assets therefore it is not a source of hidden leverage in the financial system this presumes of course that libra retains 100 backing over time and does not succumb to the age old temptation of most financial institutions which is to start playing musical chairs under the assumption that all customers would never want to withdraw funds at exactly the same time taking facebook at its word that libra will retain 100 backing libra would be safer less leveraged than traditional banks or money market funds because its risk of a run on the bank is almost certainly very low by contrast both traditional banks and money market funds are exposed to such run on the bank risk for banks due to fractional reserve banking and for money market funds due to rehypothecation of securities which creates multiple owners of the same asset i e selling something you don t already own or pledging the same asset to different lenders from a policy perspective it may interest you to know that wyoming law expressly prohibits rehypothecation of digital assets in a custodial setting owing to a wyoming supreme court case that upheld the felony fraud conviction of a person who pledged the same asset to two different lenders while this practice is rampant in both traditional banking and securities markets today it is a clear violation of property rights and should not happen ever the practice is the main cause of periodic instability in the traditional financial system since facebook s project is in its infancy and could grow to enormous size it is particularly important now to hold facebook to its promise to keep libra 100 backed permanently digital currencies such as libra and other digital assets can fit within a modern regulatory compliant framework such a framework has already been built in wyoming which would almost certainly welcome facebook s project regulatory fears regarding the libra project are overblown both because existing laws including fincen s may 9 2019 guidance regarding digital currencies and recently enacted laws in wyoming demonstrate that these projects can fit within a regulatory compliant framework that promotes innovation provides legal certainty for all parties and protects consumers within the past two years wyoming has developed a world class regulatory framework for digital currencies like libra and other digital assets with the help of some of america s top law firms and law professors here s what wyoming has done a legal framework for digital assets classified digital currencies and similar assets under existing property and commercial law thereby defining the rights and obligations of parties to a transaction providing legal remedies and enabling secured lending of digital assets wyoming law also establishes a road map for judges to follow in legal disputes and bankruptcy b custody resolved many of the legal uncertainties and transactional issues relating to digital assets that arise within custodial services and the sec s custody rule by providing a legal framework for qualified custody of these assets by wyoming banks thereby promoting their financialization and adoption by institutional investors c utility tokens created a new kind of digital asset utility tokens which have a genuine consumptive purpose the inspiration for the first token taxonomy act h r 7356 2018 it should be noted that the heavily revised second token taxonomy act h r 2144 2019 no longer contains a token taxonomy without such taxonomy the bill doesn t provide regulatory clarity and in fact that the sec has already stated key digital currencies bitcoin and ether are not securities in ordinary use cases moreover the newly added federal preemption clause preempts meaningful state level innovations and is likely to mire it in litigation with states for years the second draft h r 2144 2019 needs to be revisited d other laws established a financial technology sandbox and amended wyoming s business entity formation and taxation statutes to create a welcoming hub for innovation there appears to be a push in washington d c to require facebook s project to apply for a bank license were it not for the fact that wyoming law authorizes a new type of bank charter this would be the functional equivalent of killing facebook s project in the u s because the occ and fdic have not yet approved any banks to handle digital currencies however there is one type of bank charter wyoming s new special purpose depository institution spdi that would serve facebook s needs well while allowing it to comply with any such requirement to have a bank license by law an spdi as a state chartered bank is authorized to custody digital assets pursuant to its trust powers it would be required to comply with all federal anti money laundering and related laws it would also be required to hold 100 reserves and be prohibited from lending the federal reserve will play an important role in ensuring the safety and soundness of wyoming spdis through the fed s master account application process and spdis are also likely to want to apply to become members of the federal reserve system wyoming spdi charter applications open october 1 2019 while congress should take an enabling regulatory approach to these new payment systems congress should fear the financial privacy implications of facebook s project especially if facebook ever shares financial data with governments congress should also use this as an opportunity to revisit the fed s ioer program privacy risks surrounding facebook s calibra wallet are well documented of course that is a major concern but what concerns me even more is that governments around the world will view calibra as a surveillance tool congress should prevent governmental abuse of calibra s data by prohibiting its admission as evidence in u s criminal cases unless the government first obtained a valid warrant for the data this would bolster the u s supreme court s narrowing of the third party doctrine in last year s carpenter decision which required the government to obtain a warrant before obtaining data that americans had voluntarily disclosed to a third party cell phone site location data in that instance additionally since facebook is a u s domiciled corporation congress also has the power to block facebook from similarly sharing data with governments outside the u s for purposes of criminal prosecutions separately congress should also re open discussions about the federal reserve s interest on excess reserves ioer program not just for facebook but also generally the fed is projected to pay 35 billion to banks this year under this program without banks doing anything to earn that money incredibly that amounts to almost half of the u s budget for food stamps it is important for congress to consider whether it is appropriate for facebook s project to share in such payments whether directly or indirectly in a related move bank of england governor mark carney announced plans on june 20 2019 to open the bank of england s overnight interest bearing deposit program to payment technology providers such as libra among others rather than restricting the program only to banks since facebook does not plan to pay interest to the holders of libra facebook and its project partners would pocket these interest payments as profits risk free should facebook benefit from central bank largesse in this way at the cost of diluting every holder of u s dollars should banks benefit in this way too as this practice becomes better understood by voters calls of both where s my bailout on the one hand and end the fed on the other will inevitably become louder the bank of england s move to expand its interest bearing deposit program to facebook and other tech companies illustrates that the u s must tread carefully as other countries will be courting facebook to redomicile if u s regulation is too heavy handed to summarize the facebook libra project is aimed at satisfying demand for a much more efficient payment system relative to the status quo congress should recognize that the u s is already playing catch up our bad regulations caused the invention of stablecoins in the first place which is what brought us here today and facebook already chose a non u s location switzerland for the libra association in what should be recognized as a shot across the bow to the u s rather than fight the first real innovation in payment systems in decades the u s should embrace it wyoming s suite of innovative blockchain laws shows that such an embrace can be done largely within the existing regulatory regime in a manner that provides legal certainty protects consumers and promotes innovation i would be happy to answer questions as the committee sees fit

let s say you are deciding between two models of federal reserve candidates one has no fixed principles and embraces whatever is most politically expedient the other has a blind commitment to a dangerously wrong set of beliefs to borrow from hamilton i know it s lose lose but if you had to choose or maybe you don t because with judy shelton you can get both president donald trump has announced plans to fill two vacant fed slots with shelton now u s executive director at the european bank for reconstruction and development and christopher waller the research director at the st louis federal reserve bank waller has kept a low profile but looks like a serious researcher and reasonable candidate the same cannot be said of shelton who appears to have deftly tricked the president into thinking she supports all his bad ideas when she actually supports different possibly even worse bad ideas shelton a denizen of the republican gold bug circuit in some ways resembles trump s two recent failed fed picks stephen moore and herman cain like them she decried monetary and fiscal stimulus even while we were on the brink of depression when a democrat happened to be president but she supports ultra low rates and shrugs off deep deficits now when the economy is much stronger and can it be coincidence a republican occupies the white house back during the obama years easy money and profligate fiscal policy were about to stoke ruinous inflation and debase the dollar shelton argued zero percent interest rates were equivalent to stealing from savers she argued that the fed should stop trying to make its supposedly favored politicians look good or inflate financial markets today she has been transformed or she wants her audience of one to believe so anyway she believes interest rates should be cut to zero the fed should support the president s agenda and the central bank should help prop up markets after all people can evolve what s striking about shelton s evolutions however is that they concur exactly with what the president wants to hear these about faces call into question whether she would safeguard the fed s political independence a feature necessary for it to function trump after all has made clear he s looking for a puppet having been disappointed that the four sitting board members he previously chose haven t done his bidding besides the flip flops shelton has demonstrated her personal loyalty with effusive praise of the president she has also pointedly mentioned multiple times that trump s mar a lago club would be a lovely place for a major international monetary conference a bretton woods for the 21st century this brings me to what her actual monetary policy views are and they re doozies there is one doctrine shelton has consistently promoted for decades including in recent public comments it s sometimes difficult for laypeople probably including the president to decipher unless you understand the sound money or dependable dollar code of the crank right wing fringe her radical vision involves replacing the fed s mandate of stable prices and maximum employment with a gold standard the gold standard is roundly rejected by economists and was abandoned ages ago worldwide for good reason gold prices are volatile a gold peg also crimps liquidity in times of crisis as it did during the great depression she also wants the rest of the world to adopt some version of the same thing resulting in either fixed exchange rates or even a single global common currency that s where bretton woods at mar a lago comes in there s a lot to say about why such a system would create more severe business cycles and more international financial contagion for now it s worth pointing out that if trump actually understood what shelton is promoting he probably never would have tapped her for the fed because it contradicts so much of what he stands for such a system would mean ceding u s sovereignty over its currency as well as tighter monetary policy and at least theoretically tighter fiscal policy too she s riding two horses at the same time says american enterprise institute fellow desmond lachman shelton has tried to reconcile her grand globalist un trumpian vision with trumpian policy goals with some skillful sleights of hand in a recent washington post op ed for instance she complained that other countries are cutting rates to manipulate their currency what trump wants to hear but proposed as a solution a new dependable dollar an unsubtle wink to her fellow gold bugs but if confirmed to the fed she might eventually have to choose a lane lackey or crank
the canadian dollar rose on friday and on a weekly basis gained 0 40 percent versus the dollar the loonie is trading at 1 3026 despite the bank of canada boc holding the canadian benchmark untouched and injecting a maple dose of dovish rhetoric into the market in a battle of dovish central banks the fed took the lead by already signalling an upcoming rate cut since its last meeting in june the testimonies of fed chair powell and other high profile members as well as the publication of the minutes from said fomc june meeting has the market fully pricing in the fed lowering the interest rate at the end of the month oil prices rose on supply disruptions and a weaker dollar making the case for a stronger canadian currency monetary policy divergence is keeping the cad higher and will continue to be a factor as the fed is expected to cut more than once while the boc could wrap up 2019 without a single rate move for that scenario to happen there has to be a resolution to trade disputes and their negative effect on global growth dollar on back foot as fed dovish rhetoric continues the us dollar is lower across the board against major pairs the greenback is on its way to three consecutive losing trading sessions after fed members went full dove in their comments this week fed chair jerome powell was the biggest factor on the dollar s decline by testifying twice this week in washington about monetary policy powell kept up the dovish rhetoric and has the market fully pricing in a rate cut at the end of the month the timing seems no longer in question but the size of the cut is still open to speculation us economic indicators remain mixed and inflation although subdued is holding its ground putting question marks around a 50 basis points rate cut st louis fed chief bullard was the lone supporter of a rate cut in june and even he seems to think 50 basis point would be too much at this point in time us retail sales data to be published on tuesday july 16 at 8 30 am edt is another opportunity to validate an easing move by the fed if the pessimistic forecasts are met or potentially missed the flip side could be a surprise rebound of retail sales putting even more doubt around the number of rate cuts and the depth of the monetary policy easing eur usd fed rate cut puts downward pressure on dollar the euro gained 0 41 percent versus the dollar in the past five trading sessions the single currency is trading at 1 1271 after rhetoric from the u s federal reserve continues to signal a rate cut in july major central banks have all gone over the dovish side but the fact the fed managed to end its easing cycle and started a tightening one means it can be more active the fed is forecasted to reduce rates by 75 basis points this year something the european central bank ecb cannot match as the european interest rate is zero leaving only negative rates and quantitative easing as realistic options this year that rate cushion the fed can cut into means the dollar could fall further than the euro if the fed once again takes point on slashing rates us stocks are no strangers to lower rates and continue to rack up to record territory after the fed is near a full 180 degree turn on monetary policy the us central bank hiked rates 4 times in 2018 but market conditions and a mixed economic picture with growing trading headwinds has forced the hand of the fed into reducing the benchmark rate oil crude rises on soft dollar and weather disruptions oil prices rose slightly on friday but had solid gains on a weekly basis west texas intermediate gained 4 75 percent and brent 4 percent on the back of middle east tension gulf of mexico weather disruptions and dollar softness after a rather dovish week for the fed us inventories recorded a larger than expected drawdown of 9 5 million barrels boosting prices higher in the short term even as there are serious concerns about future demand the opec and the iea both downgraded energy demand for next year and with rising us production prices could be facing a supply glut

by marc jones london reuters surprisingly upbeat economic soundings from china lifted the global markets mood on monday pushing world shares toward an 18 month high and steering the dollar and upwards investors were waiting for a torrent of second quarter corporate earnings this week and a g7 finance chiefs meeting in france but there was plenty to be getting on with before that china s second quarter annual gdp growth rate fell to a 27 year low of 6 2 as expected but its quarterly growth reading of 1 6 was ahead of forecasts and june reports on industrial production retail sales and urban investment were also well above expectations shanghai and hong kong stock markets had ended marginally positive only held back by the concern that such a brisk pickup in activity may see economic policymakers ease back on the monetary and fiscal stimulus measures that were deemed largely responsible for the acceleration a report by reuters that washington may approve licenses for companies to restart new sales to huawei in as little as two weeks also improved the mood in china s tech sector while a steady start in europe left msci s world index eyeing feb 2018 highs it is no surprise that china is slowing down and if you look at the other components of the data like retail sales and industrial production they are looking a little bit better than expected said cmc markets analyst david madden traders seem to be content to maintain a bit of optimism with the closing in record territory again on wall street on friday and above 3 000 for the first time markets are confident the u s federal reserve will cut its key interest rate by at least a quarter point late this month in currency markets the australian dollar often played as a liquid proxy for the sprang to its highest since july 4 against the dollar as it ticked higher against the yen and the swiss franc at 12 39 the vix volatility gauge had its lowest close since april ten year treasury yields continued to nudge higher with the yield curve between 3 months and 10 years whose inversion for much of the past two months was widely seen as a harbinger of recession over the next couple of years back probing positive territory for the first since mid may most euro zone government bond yields edged down from recent 3 1 2 week highs in early moves although the reassuring signs from the global economy meant the moves were small in scale germany s benchmark 10 year bond yield was down just a basis point at minus 0 25 edging off friday s 3 1 2 week high but still about 16 basis points above record lows reached earlier this month the whole movement in bonds lost steam last week said norbert wuthe a rates strategist at bayerische landesbank relief commodities markets struggled to make up their minds about how to interpret the chinese data was off 10 cents at 66 62 fell 21 cents to 60 a barrel although that also came after both contracts had posted their biggest weekly gains in three weeks on diplomatic tensions in the middle east and cuts in u s oil production gold slipped to 1 414 25 an ounce drifting away from a recent six year top of 1 438 60 but most industrial metals climbed on the data and nickel prices were boosted by additional supply worries from major producer indonesia this china data is a big relief it seems that the government s support has eventually had some positive impact on the economy especially in the seasonally weak month of june said analyst helen lau of argonaut securities later in the week u s retail sales and industrial production data will provide clues about the health of the world s largest economy the u s federal reserve will release its beige book on wednesday which investors will scour for comments on how trade tensions were affecting the business outlook additional reporting dhara ranasinghe in london and mai nguyen in singapore editing by andrew heavens

you liz and good morning everyone this morning we ve reported earnings of 4 8 billion for the second quarter of 2019 our earnings per share of 1 95 was 20 higher than one year ago we increased our return on assets year over year to 97 basis points and generated a return on tangible common equity of 11 9 over a 100 basis points better than last year advertisement advertisement we delivered positive operating leverage for the 11th straight quarter and improved our efficiency while again growing loans and deposits these results stem from strong execution of our strategy across all lines of business and show the benefits of our global franchise and product mix global consumer banking saw 4 revenue growth overall in constant dollars with the contribution from every region in north america that was led by continued strong performance in branded cards and again we saw encouraging momentum in deposit growth which accelerated from the first quarter and internationally net income was up 25 in mexico performance was driven by good underlying revenue growth expense management and credit discipline in asia higher deposit revenues and a recovery in investment revenues drove growth in the region in our institutional clients group we delivered continued growth overall and our steadier transaction and accrual type business showing the strength of our global client network while we saw a pressure in our market sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry even in products like investment banking where we continue to gain share advertisement advertisement during the quarter we received a non objection from the federal reserve for our 2019 ccar submission that means we will meet the goals set at investor day to return at least 60 billion in capital over three ccar cycles our 21 5 billion capital we return will increase the three year total to 62 3 billion and includes raising our dividend to 0 51 and continuing to buy back shares of common stock at roughly the same level as last year s plans these buybacks have reduced our common shares outstanding by over 10 in the last year alone and help drive our tangible book value per share up 10 over that same time period given the current environment and market conditions we ll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress toward our financial targets through client led growth and research discipline including balance sheet credit and expenses as we look to the second half we ll continue to take a close look at our capacity to make sure that we re right sized for the operating environment however we won t change our commitment to safety and soundness and to making investments necessary to strengthen our infrastructure and control environment client engagement remains strong and we continue to enhance our capabilities to serve our clients the way they want to be served across our network that said there remains uncertainty with respect to the economic market and rate environment but we think i think we ve shown that our franchise can manage through these by focusing on the things that we can control advertisement advertisement i ll now turn it over to mark and then we ll be happy to take your questions mark mark mason chief financial officer thank you mike and good morning everyone starting on slide 3 net income of 4 8 billion in the second quarter grew 7 from last year including a roughly 350 million pre tax gain on our investment in tradeweb which benefited eps by 0 12 per share excluding the gain eps of 1 83 grew by 12 mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding as well as a lower tax rate revenues of 18 8 billion grew 2 from the prior year reflecting the tradeweb gain as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in icg however this growth was partially offset by lower market sensitive revenues in icg as well as mark to market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio advertisement advertisement expenses declined 2 year over year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio while overall credit quality remained stable our return on assets was 97 basis points for the quarter and we generated an rotce of 11 9 our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 slightly better than our outlook we expect our tax rate to be between 22 and 23 for the back half of the year in constant dollars end of period loans grew 3 year over year to 689 billion as 4 growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets and deposits grew 5 with contribution from both our consumer and institutional franchises looking at results for the first half of 2019 we saw continued momentum in consumer as well as the accrual businesses in icg which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market sensitive revenues along with the continued wind down of legacy assets and while we did benefit from the tradeweb gain this was largely offset by the impact of mark to market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio we delivered positive operating leverage with a 3 decline in expenses eps grew by 15 and our rotce was 11 9 for the first half advertisement advertisement turning now to each business slide 4 shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars the consumer business showed continued momentum in the second quarter revenues grew 4 with contribution from all regions while expenses were up 1 driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings for the first half of the year excluding the hilton gain last year we generated 4 consumer revenue growth on flat expenses resulting in 8 growth in operating margin and 13 growth in net income slide 5 shows the results for north america consumer in more detail second quarter revenues of 5 2 billion were up 3 from last year during the quarter we continue to enhance our digital capabilities and launch new products to lay the foundation for a more integrated multi product relationship model our deposit momentum continue to improve as net deposit inflows in the first half of 2019 more than doubled compared with last year we are growing deposits with both new and existing retail bank customers in and out of our branch footprint and through both digital and traditional channels in digital we further enhanced our account opening process and launched new products designed to deepen our client relationships including relationship based offers that leverage our proprietary thankyou and double cash rewards across both card and deposit products we generated more than 1 billion in digital deposit sales in the second quarter bringing our total for the first half to over 2 billion nearly two thirds of these deposits sales were outside of our existing branch footprint and were with card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us results from our new digital lending product flex loan also continue to be positive following its launch in january as loan originations more than tripled from the first to the second quarter while maintaining a strong credit profile and we will continue to roll out new features and products in the second half of the year so again while many of these initiatives are still new we feel good about our progress advertisement advertisement turning now to the results of the individual businesses retail banking revenues of 1 4 billion were roughly flat year over year excluding mortgage retail banking revenues grew 1 as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was partially offset by lower deposit spreads in commercial banking average deposit growth accelerated to 2 year over year and looking at deposits and assets under management in aggregate we grew customer balances by 4 mortgage revenues were largely stable again this quarter on a sequential basis but declined year over year mostly reflecting higher funding costs turning to branded cards revenues of 2 2 billion grew 7 year over year client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 8 and we continue to generate growth in interest earning balances this quarter up about 10 this growth in interest earning balances drove a year over year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans or nir percent to 896 points this quarter looking forward we would expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads as we look to maintain our current mix of interest earning to non interest earning balances average loan growth improved to 2 this quarter as we saw a smaller drag from promotional balances in the prior year and we expect loan growth to continue to improve as we go into the back half of the year advertisement advertisement finally retail services revenues of 1 6 billion grew 1 driven by loan growth partially offset by higher contractual partner payments total expenses for north america consumer were up 2 year over year as higher volume related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings turning to credit net credit losses grew by 12 year over year reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios card ncl rates were essentially flat quarter over quarter and consistent with the pattern seen in prior years we expect card ncl rates in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half of the year our performance year to date is in line with our full ncl rate outlook for both branded cards and retail services at 300 basis points to 325 basis points and 500 basis points to 525 basis points respectively on slide 6 we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars second quarter revenues of 3 3 billion grew 4 in latin america total consumer revenues grew 3 or 5 on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year loan and deposit growth was muted in mexico again this quarter reflecting the current environment where we are seeing a deceleration in gdp growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes but importantly we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns as seen again this quarter in our strong ebit growth year over year turning to asia consumer revenues grew 5 year over year in the second quarter or 3 excluding a one time gain mostly driven by higher deposit revenues as well as a recovery in investment revenues we continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in asia with 10 growth in citigold clients and 7 growth in net new money versus last year in total operating expenses were down 1 in the second quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume driven growth and cost of credit was down 3 reflecting a smaller lrr build relative to the prior year slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail credit continue to be favorable again this quarter with ncl and delinquency rates broadly stable across the regions turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 8 revenues of 9 7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3 excluding the tradeweb gain as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark to market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter total banking revenues of 5 1 billion were down 1 treasury trade solutions revenues of 2 4 billion were up 4 as reported and 7 in constant dollars with growth in deposits transaction volumes and trade spreads reflecting continued strong client engagement investment banking revenues of 1 3 billion declined 10 from last year while outperforming the market wallet the decline was primarily driven by a strong prior year performance in m a partially offset by continued strength in debt underwriting private bank revenues of 866 million were up 2 reflecting growth with both new and existing clients which drove higher lending deposits and aum volumes partially offset by spread compression and corporate lending revenues of 538 million were down 9 reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost total markets and security services revenues of 4 7 billion were down 4 from last year excluding the tradeweb gain as growth in security services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and investor client activity has remained muted excluding tradeweb fixed income revenues declined 4 year over year reflecting the challenging trading environment particularly in rates equities revenues were down 9 reflecting lower client activity in cash equities and prime brokerage partially offset by strong corporate client activity in derivatives and security services revenues were up 3 on a reported basis and 7 in constant dollars reflecting higher rates as well as higher client activity total operating expenses of 5 4 billion declined 2 year over year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth and cost of credit was 103 million this quarter reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio credit quality remained stable and total non accrual loans declined both sequentially and on a year over year basis looking at the first half of the year in icg our operating margin improved by 1 as solid contributions from our growing higher returning network businesses most notably tts and security services were largely offset by the decline in our market sensitive businesses we are focused on continuing to build upon the strength that we are seeing in our network businesses by making it easier for our large multinational clients to do more business around the world we are investing in technology to further digitize and improve our on boarding processes enhance our client facing platforms and roll out new capabilities across the franchise as we support the growth in cross border flows that we are seeing with our multinational clients and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives going forward slide 9 shows the results for corporate other revenues of 532 million increased 1 from last year as higher treasury revenues and gains were largely offset by the wind down of legacy assets expenses were down 20 mostly reflecting the wind down and the pre tax income was 73 million this quarter somewhat better than our prior outlook looking ahead we would still expect a modest pre tax quarterly loss in corporate other for the remainder of 2019 slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends in constant dollars total net interest revenue of nearly 12 billion this quarter grew by roughly 450 million year over year reflecting higher rates loan growth and a favorable loan mix as well as higher trading related nir along with the absence of the fdic surcharge on a sequential basis net interest revenue grew by roughly 230 million largely reflecting higher trading related nir along with one additional day in the quarter however net interest margin declined 5 basis point sequentially as the benefit of higher revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter in the first half of 2019 our net interest revenue grew by 6 or roughly 1 3 billion year over year in constant dollars looking ahead to the remainder of the year as a reminder when we set our nir outlook for 2019 back in january we were assuming one us rate increase in mid 2019 but the expected benefit of the rate hike had been relatively small as of last quarter we had taken that rate hike out of our assumptions and now we recognize that we may begin to see rate cuts as early as later this month but keep in mind that the estimated impact of each rate cut remains relatively small we continue to estimate that each 25 basis point cut in us rates impacts revenues by roughly 50 million on a quarterly basis but of course this will depend on the competitive environment for deposits and other factors so the rate environment continues to evolve but we are managing our rate sensitivity carefully and we continue to expect to generate net interest revenue growth this year of about 4 in constant dollars which equates to roughly 2 billion of growth as we ve discussed on previous earnings calls turning to non interest revenue on a full year basis we continue to expect total non interest revenue to come in roughly flat to the prior year in the first half of 2019 non interest revenue declined by close to 900 million all of which you saw in the first quarter this decline was mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the hilton portfolio in the prior year as well as a very strong prior year comparison in equities in the first quarter along with the drag from mark to market losses on loan hedges in the second quarter while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues it was entirely offset by the tradeweb gain so non interest revenues were flat to last year looking ahead to the second half of 2019 as a reminder in consumer we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018 when we had a 250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in mexico however we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter even if investor client activity remains muted similar to what we ve seen so far this year on slide 11 we show our capital we show our key capital metrics in the second quarter our tangible book value per share increased 10 year over year to 67 64 driven by net income and the lower share count and our cet1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11 9 as net income was offset by 4 6 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends to conclude while the revenue environment has proved challenging for some of our businesses we made continued progress in the first half of 2019 from a revenue perspective we re seeing solid momentum across the consumer franchise and continued growth in our accrual businesses in icg and while we ve seen pressure in some of our market sensitive businesses results have generally reflected the broader industry we continue to believe we can generate modest year over year revenue growth in 2019 driven by continued growth in net interest revenue and more stable trends in non interest revenue versus 2018 on the expense side our productivity savings have exceeded our incremental investments by roughly 300 million so far this year putting us on track to achieve the upper end of the 500 million to 600 million in incremental net savings we had expected for full year 2019 expenses were down year over year in the first half and we believe that was prudent given the revenue headwinds we faced looking ahead we will maintain this expense discipline relative to the revenue environment while continuing to make the essential investments in the franchise including investments in infrastructure and controls but we do expect expenses to be lower on a sequential basis from the first half to the second half of the year and while the operating environment is uncertain we will continue to look to all of our return levers with a continued focus on our full year rotce target of 12 for 2019 before we go into q a let me spend a few moments on our outlook for the third quarter specifically in icg we expect continued year over year growth in our accrual businesses as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network and markets and investment banking revenue should reflect the overall market environment on the consumer side in north america solid revenue growth should continue driven by us branded cards in asia we expect continued year over year revenue growth and in mexico as i just mentioned we will be comparing to the third quarter last year which included a gain on the sale of our asset management business on an underlying basis similar to the results seen so far this year revenue growth will likely remain somewhat muted although we expect continued strong growth in pre tax earnings for total citigroup expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year over year reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in icg with that mike and i are happy to take any questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john mcdonald autonomous research analyst hi good morning mark wanted to ask about the michael corbat chief executive officer good morning john john mcdonald autonomous research analyst how you re doing wanted to ask about the rotce goal so 12 goal for 2019 you re on the doorstep so far with the first half of 11 9 as we think about levers to kind of keep that up in the second half and push over the goal line to get above 12 for the year second half often has not as strong capital markets obviously it hasn t been so good this quarter so far this year so just what are the things to think about puts and takes for the second half that could get you over that 12 for the year michael corbat chief executive officer yes thank you so 12 remains the target for 2019 as you heard mike mention you heard me mention we were obviously in an uncertain environment the good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the consumer franchise particularly in branded cards as we ve talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances and we d expect that revenue growth to continue through the balance of the year you heard me mention the international franchises which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there is muted growth to have to offset that with expense management and therefore have ebit growth particularly in the case of latin america so those will be two positive drivers i would point to i obviously point to our accrual businesses and transaction businesses on the icg side 7 growth in both security services and tts this quarter we d expect continued growth from those businesses and on the expense side we talked to or i talked to really being on the high end of those productivity savings outweighing investments and i would expect to certainly come in with that on the 600 million side of the range that we ve talked to there the big area where the uncertainty in the environment you can pick the factor whether it s the direct what s going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions it plays out through the market sensitive businesses it plays out through the trading that you see on fixed income and equities it plays out through investment banking it impacts corporate sentiment and those things as you would imagine are difficult to predict we obviously feel good about the client dialog that we ve had but that s those are the factors that are a bit harder to manage and when we see that softness what you saw in the first half is that we pulled levers that we could pull responsibly and you should expect that we would continue to do that in the back half without compromising two things one the investments required to continue to grow the strong parts of the franchise and two infrastructure and controls and those two things we think are critical to the long term sustainability of the franchise we ll continue to manage credit very carefully you saw our tax rate come in a little bit lower this quarter we ll continue to do work around what we can do to get the tax rate as low as we responsibly can get it and you ve seen us actually do more on the capital side so that combination of things we think is helpful in obviously trying to get to that target of the 12 there is some unpredictability to that particularly on the market side and to the extent that that plays out more severely than forecasted we would expect to be in and around the range of 12 john mcdonald autonomous research analyst i guess also you did say that you re expecting to have lower card losses in the second half versus the first so that should help was there any frontloading of marketing or any other expense kind of frontloading or investment frontloading that happened michael corbat chief executive officer yes i mean when you look at the profitability just in general on the consumer business it does tend to skew toward the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend we also and i mentioned this on the last call we also pulled forward some of the repositioning that we were looking to do as we reorganize around different parts of the franchise and so savings that we were expecting kind of later in 2020 we can we ll see some of that benefit play out through the back half of 19 so there are those things around levers and actions that we took in the first half that not only help the first half but have the potential to help us in the second half as well john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and just last thing from me on that note you still looking ahead toward the goal of 13 5 for next year michael corbat chief executive officer yes 13 5 remains the target for next year just to obviously again i ll point back to the environment that we re in we ll see how the environment plays out we ll see how the market reacts to rate reduction obviously the activity we saw last week in the way of a market reaction was pretty favorable to having more certainty around the direction of rates but we ll see how those some of those things play out and it does remain a target and if we have to identify additional levers to try and pull to get there we will but as we stand here today that 13 5 remains our target for 2020 john mcdonald autonomous research analyst great thanks michael corbat chief executive officer thank you operator and your next question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr evercore analyst hi thanks very much michael corbat chief executive officer hi glenn glenn schorr evercore analyst hello question on the net interest income trends so if you look at the 12 decline in non interest bearing deposits and the 9 increase in interest bearing deposits and then also the 7 basis point rise in deposit costs sequentially and then the drop in loan yields those trends combined while not surprising you would think from the outside would be a more negative tone on nii but i think your guide was actually pretty good are there offsets that we don t see and or are some of those trends like the tail end of things that have been in motion and they actually get better over the next couple of quarters michael corbat chief executive officer yes so in terms of the net interest revenue we re obviously at about 1 3 billion of net interest revenue with a strong q1 about 450 million in q2 and as we look at that we ve obviously factored in at this point not only the shift that you ve mentioned from non interest bearing to interest bearing but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there and so as we look at it and we look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side and we look at the and the deposit growth that we re seeing particularly in the tts franchise with higher volumes a growth of 10 or so we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4 growth in nir notwithstanding that there are other factors that come into play not the least of which is how many additional cuts play out through the balance of the year but as we sit here today we feel pretty good about that the bigger driver the biggest driver i think would be as i mentioned continued growth on the branded card side continued growth on the accrual businesses those are going to be the larger factors that play through the back half of the year glenn schorr evercore analyst okay appreciate that maybe a little more color on the loan yield side coming down i m assuming that is libor based loans and the follow up i have on that is who makes the call on those loans meaning libor based versus prime based is it you or is it client led i m just curious on how to think about that as we go forward it looks like libor it does but the prime didn t obviously michael corbat chief executive officer yeah so we ve had we certainly saw some revenue pressure in the corporate lending book that was a combination of kind of the spread compression in addition to some hedging cost and that certainly played through here in terms of the pricing of the loans that is a both a byproduct of what we re seeing in the market in the way of competition from a pricing point of view obviously and the funding cost that we have i think what we ve tried to be diligent about is where they are were there where there are opportunities to both serve the client and not necessarily tie up the balance sheet we ve taken advantage of those opportunities particularly in our trading our trade lending activity so that we re not bringing on economic positions that or positions that are uneconomical we continue to see pressure from a pricing point of view in asia and so you ve seen our asia loans come down just because the combination of the economics not making sense again as well as just really slowing demand given what s going on with trade and so there is pressure from a spread point of view we do have a view toward pricing that not only considers our own internal funding but also the client demand and the competitive landscape and that combination of factors is what plays out through the yield glenn schorr evercore analyst okay really appreciate it thank you michael corbat chief executive officer thank you operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning michael corbat chief executive officer hi jim jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey maybe just following up on glenn s question just to zero in on deposits a little bit interest bearing deposit rates paid was up 7 basis points without any kind of a hike is that just the mix shift you mentioned i think it looked like asia deposits were up i would imagine they re higher rates so just trying to figure out is there domestic pressure on rates paid or is that just mix mark mason chief financial officer yes so there is some mix shift i mean there is some shift from non interest bearing to interest bearing on the jim mitchell buckingham research analyst that won t impact the rates paid on interest bearing mark mason chief financial officer yes that s right and then so the other dynamic is in fact what we re seeing there are two things one what we see in the market from a competitive point of view two there tends to be a lag effect from the betas that play through on the retail side and then three as we ve been growing some of the us deposits that i mentioned earlier some of that has been growth out of our markets but with high so tide with high yield saving account type product jim mitchell buckingham research analyst so would you expect that to continue to creep higher a little bit or start to stabilize michael corbat chief executive officer it kind of depends on kind of what happens in the broader rate environment we obviously are talking about rate cuts now and that ultimately over time would have an impact i think the strategic way that i tend to look at it is these deposit the deposit activity that we have with clients is really geared toward the broader relationship that we have with them as you know and so we had a lot of good deposit growth on the tts side that s around the broader solutions that we talk to and work with those clients around the deposit growth we re seeing on the consumer side is really about the demonstrating the digital capabilities that we have and really broadening the relationship we have with them so yes there is some pricing pressure the rate movement in the future will certainly have an impact on how much more or less of that plays through but we do think we re making progress against the broader strategic objectives jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay and a clarification for the 2 billion in nir growth this year are you assuming now a rate cut in that number i m not sure if i heard you say that michael corbat chief executive officer yes we are assuming one rate cut in that number jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay that s very helpful and then michael corbat chief executive officer towards the back half of the year jim mitchell buckingham research analyst right and just one question on tts and trade finance you mentioned spreads being wider and trade so is sort of the trade war helping you a little bit or have you seen a slowdown certainly trade flows seem to have slowed how do we think about but you seem pretty confident in the growth in that business so how are you thinking about the dynamics there michael corbat chief executive officer i think from a trade perspective i would say i don t want to say bau but business activity remains fairly strong i think we ve seen some trade routes shifting the example we give as you know as opposed to soy from the us soy from brazil etc so trade routes shifting i think our clients are kind of very engaged around kind of studying and trying to stay ahead of that so i don t think we would speak to any kind of slowdown as of yet but clearly people are paying a lot of attention to it jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay great thank you operator your next question is from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning michael corbat chief executive officer good morning matt o connor deutsche bank analyst so you guys are executing on the capital deployment strategy you laid out a couple of years ago and to be fair i think there was some kind of debate or concern whether you could execute on that and you are but now you re sitting here you performed very well in dfast some of your peers surprised the market and delivered more than expected and it seems like you re positioned to do even more than what you had promised couple of years ago and just wondering your thoughts on whether you can do it and the timing and how you approach it michael corbat chief executive officer yes so as you mentioned we back at investor day we talked about 60 billion plus over the three year cycle we were going to exceed that we just announced the 21 5 billion over the four quarters covered by this 2019 cycle as you know we have an objective we re trying to obviously generate the highest return and return as much capital as we can to our shareholders we currently manage to a cet1 target of 11 5 and that obviously has buffers in it for some of the uncertainty that s still out there whether it d be proposals like scb and or other things that impact the variability of capital as we get greater clarity on those things we will obviously continue to kind of look at that but that remains the target going forward we ve got we re still running at 11 9 cet1 ratio so subject to growth needs we will always be looking at how we ensure that we run that more tightly to that target of 11 5 and the way we think about the return of capital or distribution of capital going forward is largely as we get close to that 11 5 which we expect to get close to toward the end of the year will be around how much capital we generate just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow and so we certainly have the objective of continuing to return as much as makes good sense given the growth opportunities for the franchise if you look back over the three year cycle we ve returned on average about 121 of our net available to common so we feel pretty good about that percentage albeit we started at a higher cet1 ratio years ago matt o connor deutsche bank analyst and can you just remind us as we think about the 11 5 target what are some of the areas of clarity that you re looking for in terms of reevaluating that we obviously got some comments from the fed in recent weeks that seems like the stress test might be a little bit easier than feared as they bring in the stress capital buffer and just what are some of the things specifically that you re looking for to potentially bring that down michael corbat chief executive officer yes so ad look there are you just mentioned one with the scb that s one of the proposal that s still out there we just got as you mentioned some clarity of that we ll have to see how that factors in there are number of other proposals that are still outstanding and the dialog that we ve heard from regulators is largely around ensuring that those things that there is understanding of how those things will work in aggregate in terms of how they impact the amount of capital that institutions have to hold whether that s additional clarity on how to think about gsib we obviously have cecl that will come into play in early 2020 but all of those factors are important we ve heard commentary around greater clarity or transparency as part of the ccar process we obviously support greater transparency we think it will help to remove some of the variability in capital planning so as that starts to kind of come into continue to come into the fold that will be important to how we think about this so those are just a couple of examples mark mason chief financial officer and we think as we look at it s mark when we think about the 4 5 plus the 3 plus the 3 what s in some ways on the table is the management buffer the 100 basis points and as you describe as we look at gsib and cecl and kind of all these things coming together whether or not there is an opportunity to reexamine that or not michael corbat chief executive officer that s right matt o connor deutsche bank analyst and then just lastly to bring it all together like as you think about some of these moving pieces do you think you ll have clarity before the next ccar cycle that might motivate you to resubmit or is it more hoping to have clarity for the next cycle on these factors michael corbat chief executive officer it s these things kind of take time to play out i think as we ve seen over the past couple of years and so we ll just really have to see how much additional clarity we get over the coming months and we ll figure that out as time progresses matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hey guys good morning michael corbat chief executive officer good morning saul martinez ubs analyst a couple of questions first mark i just wanted to clarify the nii guide so i think you mentioned you re still on track to for 2 billion increase this year versus last year of that and 4 that does imply by my calculations that second half the quarterly run rate does continue to ratchet up versus the first half something like 12 1 12 2 is that i just wanted to clarify that s right and that s including a rate cut being baked into that outlook michael corbat chief executive officer yes so what we are still targeting and on track for 2 billion for the full year as i stated we do have one rate hike that we re assuming mark mason chief financial officer rate cut michael corbat chief executive officer sorry rate cut that we are assuming excuse me rate cut that we re assuming on the back in the back half of the year obviously if that happens sooner happens in in july that would have an impact on the nir forecast that we have and candidly if there is more than one rate cut that would have additional impact and so those are the factors there are obviously other factors that come into play but that is and that is assuming obviously a change in the us rate so but we are still targeting the 2 billion recognizing there is some risk there saul martinez ubs analyst got it but given that the 50 million impact from 25 per quarter from each 25 basis points to cut presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts it seems like you re confident that you can get nii growth in the back end of the year versus the first half michael corbat chief executive officer yes i think the broader issue is the uncertainty that mike and i have referenced that s just out there and so if we just isolated this to two interest rate cuts in the scheme of a 47 billion nir line i mean you re absolutely you re right but the reality is that it s the broader uncertainty that s out there that s impacting that s impacting the industry and a lot of that flows through the market sensitive revenues and just kind of corporate sentiment more broadly saul martinez ubs analyst was there in the past you ve broken out this slide on page 10 where you break out the accrual versus legacy versus trading is there a reason why you re not doing that this time around michael corbat chief executive officer yes just i mean as we kind of exited holdings and started to kind of wind down those legacy businesses it became less of a significant variable as you look at these total revenues it was probably 5 of the aggregate revenues in the first quarter and so it just wasn t as it wasn t on a constant dollar basis just wasn t as meaningful and so we move toward simplifying it with both the legacy break out as well as the trading nir breakout saul martinez ubs analyst okay and one final one from me a large portion of the expected profitability expansion in north america consumer comes from rightsizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposit inflows the digital strategies tapping your cards network or your cards clients but you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads are likely going to come in and i think you didn t have any growth in revenues in retail banking in a tougher rate environment can you right size profitability or how much more difficult is it to right size the profitability of your retail banking business if the fed continues to cut michael corbat chief executive officer yes i d make i make two points one is as i think about the back half of 2019 and even 2020 for that matter i think that the work that we ve done in branded cards is going to be a meaningful contributor or continue to be a meaningful contributor to the revenue performance that we see in consumer north america the north america retail bank as you mentioned we it runs at a high efficiency rate at this point we are seeing good traction as it relates to deposits increasing but what again what that s really about for us is how we deepen the relationships and kind of broaden the penetration of those products and services into our card customer base and so overtime i think it s going to be more challenging to look at just the retail banking portion of that we break out in income because of that broader client strategy and so i think so i think that s kind of how we ve thought about it that said i mentioned kind of repositioning that we have taken in the first quarter that we ve taken a bit of that in the second quarter that s largely around the reorganization to support that strategy and moving from a product silo ed type of business model to one that is more geared toward the client and we think that that will help that obviously will help the margins as we continue to execute against the strategy saul martinez ubs analyst got it that s really helpful thank you operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi i have one very short term question and one very long term question the very short term question relates to what was the dollar amount of the mark to market hedge losses you said that roughly offset tradeweb or was a much bigger number than what was in the press release so what was that number michael corbat chief executive officer so the in the quarter the mark to market loan losses were losses on loan hedges were 75 million for the half is what i was talking about for the half that number was about 306 million so about 231 million in the first quarter and so that s the number mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst okay and then the longer term question is how much runway do you have left with technology to improve citigroup s efficiency mark when you mentioned the levers to help meet your targets the rotce target of 12 you didn t mention technology yet you mentioned the 300 million spread between the savings from the investments over the new investment level so what s the runway left kind of short medium and long term thanks mark mason chief financial officer well in that line in that 500 million to 600 million for the year the 300 million that we ve done year to date as it relates to productivity are the benefits of the technology investments that we ve been making so some portion of those savings is a byproduct of technology investments we continue we see those technology benefits in the digital capabilities that we built out and how that plays out in a lower cost to not only acquire but lower cost to service the clients we see things like the use of e statements going up we see things like volumes into call centers going down all of those things are beneficiary or benefits that are generated as a byproduct of technology investments that we ve made we expect a similar level of productivity saves in 2020 we do continue to invest in technology in fact what you heard me mention earlier in terms of one of the protected areas being infrastructure and control there are couple of different ways to look at that protected area as we invest in technology around our infrastructure and improve the data quality that we have and things of that sort not only does it help us run a safer and more sound organization but it also arms us with information sooner to enable us to react and serve our clients more quickly and so yes the answer is yes we do see benefits from technology playing out in these in the expense line and in the productivity savings that i ve referenced both in 19 and 2020 and likely beyond and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we ve talked about achieving over time michael corbat chief executive officer mike i think if you go to page 21 in the deck you can see we ve put in there some different drivers and metrics and i think from a the way i think about it is today we really run the combination of an analog and a digital bank and the faster we can continue to drive digital adoption mobile usage we know that that s cheaper it s significantly cheaper when we re solving issues on your phone or we re solving issues away from physical interaction or voice and again you can see we ve got roughly 30 million active digital users we ve got 20 million active mobile users between north america and international and you can look at the year over year growth rates i think probably among the highest in the industry and so we re on this journey and obviously the investments that we can make to switch those over we think yield quite high returns mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst and then last follow up mark you reaffirmed the guidance to the rotce for this year and next and mike do you also reaffirm that guidance i assume you do michael corbat chief executive officer absolutely mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst so citi this predates you have missed a lot of targets this decade as we approach the end of the decade and consensus does not expect you to reach those targets and look we have a buy on the stock we haven t always had a buy on the stock and we don t even have you reaching those targets so where do you think the disconnect it you think that citi is going to get a 13 5 rotce next year and you re hard pressed upon too many other people who agree with you assuming we don t have a recession or anything like that where do you think the market is wrong mark mason chief financial officer no let me let me try to answer that in a couple of ways first let me go back to 19 for a second because both mike and i have said that the 12 remains the target for 2019 it absolutely does you can also look at the first half of the year or the fourth quarter of last year and witness strength in the franchise on the consumer side on the accrual side of the business but you can also witness the impact of the environment that we re in and the uncertainty around that despite that uncertainty we ve gotten to 11 9 in the first half through pulling a number of levers and we would expect to continue to pull those levers into the back half of this year to the extent that that uncertainty increases or there is more significant reaction from the market to the uncertainty we ll of course look and work to find additional levers but at some point that becomes challenged in terms of getting to that 12 just given the things we want to protect in this franchise and i believe that even if it were to become challenge that we d end up in a range around that 12 and that is what we re working toward that target that 12 target in terms of 2020 and the 13 5 target that we have for 2020 and the disconnect i mean we ve talked through the disconnect in the past and it moves around as you would you know very well but it s range from being a little bit of a difference of views on the top line which i think we ve started to narrow some of that gap given the performance we ve been able to demonstrate through the first half of the year again in those strong areas there has also been less of a disconnect on the expense line as i ve given i think a little bit more specificity around the guidance there there has been a cost of credit difference of views in the past and again we feel pretty good about our cost of credit outlook but we obviously recognize that where we are in the cycle there has been obviously tax work that we ve continued to do and we ll continue to do and i gave some additional view on that we ve done more on capital than we originally talked about and so it s those drivers and levers that we ll continue to pull through the balance of this year we ll see how this year plays out given all of the uncertainty referenced and will go into 2020 with the 13 5 remaining our target and with the with clarity on where we think we ll end up against it michael corbat chief executive officer and mike the way i think about it simplistically is we re going to do everything within our power to get to those numbers with the exception of two things one is we are going to continue to make the investments that are necessary to keep our business competitive you can see a lot of things going on around us and i think around our franchises in consumer or in our institutional business as an example in tts or security services we think we ve just got to make those investments to stay competitive and the second thing is around our is our commitment to our shareholders and our regulators to make sure that we re making the investments in terms of safety and soundness and so we won t put those at risk but everything else is on the table mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi good morning michael corbat chief executive officer good morning steven chubak wolfe research analyst so wanted to start off with a question on the ficc business and you cited some of the pressures within ficc and rates in particular and your business has always been somewhat unique just give the higher contributions from tts in particular with non financial corporates i think that s more than 30 of your total revenue there i m wondering whether you re seeing greater resiliency on that side of the business which would suggest maybe even more pronounced pressure within institutional mark mason chief financial officer so i guess what i d say is obviously our fixed income revenues for the quarter were down about 4 if you exclude the gain from tradeweb i think when you look at what transpired in the quarter there was a fair amount of volatility around rate around rates and rate movement and what we saw was that play out particularly around the investor client base that we have so to the point we ve made before we continue to see stable corporate client activity particularly in rates and currencies where there is a strong linkage to our broader franchise and in particular tts but we did see decreased activity with our investor clients given all the macro uncertainty that i ve mentioned now a couple of times many of the investor clients remained on the sidelines and frankly it was the speed and the magnitude of the rate movements that created a challenging marketing market environment and made it difficult to monetize client flows on the equity side well you didn t ask about equity but on the equity side i mean that the trade war had a similar or trade discussions and war had a similar impact that kind of flowed through particularly again with investor clients i mentioned earlier impacting impacting both cash equities and prime brokerage but we did see again corporate client activity even in equities kind of hold up nicely playing out through equity derivatives michael corbat chief executive officer and the way i would say it mark because i think is engagement is high engagement s very good but i think right now the challenge listen maybe it s the opportunity in that we re clearly pivoting from an environment where we had predicted or thought or had been built in rising rates to at this point rates going lower and i think from our perspective we don t believe that the market has made that full adjustment and there s probably some churn that s got to come as portfolios setup for that potentially lower rate environment the question is when will that come and to what degree will that come will there will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition because i think today they re not position where they need to be fully mark mason chief financial officer and again to that point just last week when there appear to be some signs of greater clarity on the move in rates the reduction in rates and the timing of that the equity markets responded very very favorably to that and so to your point mike i think clarity in direction should yield greater confidence and perhaps a more of a risk on mentality as it relates to the markets steven chubak wolfe research analyst no very helpful color i appreciate that and just one follow up from me on icg credit you guided to or indicated some normalization of credit trends but the charge off rate there is quite low at 8 basis points i m just wondering is it fair for us to extrapolate that 8 basis point loss rate as indicative of what you view as normalized and can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view mark mason chief financial officer yes i mean again when you think about our corporate lending book and the quality of our exposure the multinational clients that we cover the 83 of it being investment grade type exposure historically we ve had loss rates that have been low in the way of number of basis points 5 basis points to 6 basis points historically and yes we are starting to see some normalization of that i think the quarter cost of credit at a 103 million is reflective of that coming out of last year and representative i think of what we ve talked to in a way of what to look to see in the way of normalization and so i think it s a byproduct of the quality of the book that we have and the nature of the the nature of the activity that we do in lending steven chubak wolfe research analyst okay great that s it for me thanks for taking my questions mark mason chief financial officer thank you operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst hey thanks a lot just a follow up on the credit side mark you point out that the on the consumer side of credit that things have also kind of has gone according to plan you ve maintained that guide at what point do you see the end of the light in terms of the seasoning meaning how long do you think you can kind of stay in this very benign zone for the card side presuming that the economy stays in relatively good form any reason to see any change to that i guess is the question mark mason chief financial officer yes i mean not at this stage i mean it s we gave kind of medium term guidance if you will and we talked about those ranges of 300 basis points to 325 basis points 500 basis points to 525 basis points again certainly through the balance of this year we expect to end up inside of that range we look at probably all the things that would be would be obvious to folks and then some so if you look at just on the macro front we re obviously looking and watching closely the inverted yield curve and what that has meant historically but when we look at that juxtaposed against the internal metrics that we use whether that d be card usage patterns or utilization or payment rates or percentage of customers making minimum payments i mean thus far those indicators have all remained broadly stable and so i don t see any cause at this point for material concern ken usdin jefferies analyst okay and then the tax rate you mentioned 22 23 in the back half and you ve also talked about potentially being some more levers there can you help us understand like does that mean that over time you have the chance to still take the tax rate lower as you look into 20 and as part of your plan for the rotce improvement mark mason chief financial officer we re constantly looking at it and trying to identify opportunities looking at obviously where we book business and the client demands around that and where there are opportunities to do that but at this point i m not taking down the guidance i m just obviously pointing out perhaps the obvious which is that it s one of the levers that we continue to push on and explore ken usdin jefferies analyst understood last one just on the deposit cost side with the potential rates turning and some non us central banks already cutting what s the lag effect here in terms of this quarter the deposit costs were up 7 basis points what s the rate of change that you need to see before you can see a leveling out of the basis point increases that we see on the deposit cost side thanks mark mark mason chief financial officer yes so i guess it s what we ve seen during the rate rise or increases were that the betas on the corporate side on the commercial side of kind of tick up a lot faster and there tends to be a lag on the retail consumer side and as things turn i would expect to some extent similar type of direction notwithstanding that the retail deposit side still has that lag to it and there are other factors such as the competitive landscape that s out there for deposits and so it s a little bit hard to kind of pinpoint exactly when that stabilizes just given all of those factors but we re obviously managing it closely and managing it in the context of the broader strategy that i referenced a couple of times now operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning michael corbat chief executive officer good morning betsy betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst a couple of questions just on the deposit business a follow up there could you give us a sense i think you mentioned at the beginning of the call that you had a 2 billion increase in deposits that was from the digital efforts you ve got two thirds outside your footprint and half of the two coming from folks that have your card but didn t have a banking relationship with you could you just give us a sense of how that was relative to expectations and what you think the major drivers were for generating that growth speaking to rate versus marketing versus any other factors that you want to add mark mason chief financial officer yes so what one would say that is in line with what we were expecting in the way of deposit performance through the digital sales channel we have seen kind of broadly just good activity with our consumer retail clients not just with the net deposits but also retaining deposits as they shift into aums and so as clients start to make investments and so the flow levels have been very good if you include both aums and the deposits i would say we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year it is a combination but if you think about our strategy again to target card customers a good portion of the deposit growth that we achieved were outside of our six markets and with our card customers who did not have a retail banking relationship it s a byproduct i would say of not only rate so there was some portion that is tied to the high yield savings account although even that does demonstrate the power of the model because we know these customers and they re not cannibal it s not a cannibalization of what we gather inside of our market but it s also a byproduct of the work we ve been doing around creating a value proposition and understanding which of our clients are likely to respond to which to what rewards and so you heard me mention baking points and double cash reward those were part of the offerings to clients to join us in terms of the retail banking products that we offer in exchange for either more thank you points or more benefits that accrue from the double cash reward so it is a combination of marketing targeted marketing in terms of knowing the customers we want to go after and what they re likely to respond to some of it is rate yes but it s a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst and then i know you mentioned that the nim came under a little bit of pressure as you had significant increase in deposit growth and the tie in question here is is there anything you need to see from these customers is there like to do they need to keep the deposits with you for a certain amount of time before you re able to take some duration with these deposits on the asset side or should we anticipate that as you re growing your new deposits here out of footprint that that gets reinvested in the front end of the curve mark mason chief financial officer yes so i mean obviously there are lcr treatment for different types of deposits these are largely time deposits that we ve been bringing in and i think that we would expect that to like i said expect that to continue down the path there is no reason for us to feel as though the these are kind of short term in nature or anything of that sort betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay but they d be match funded or match invested i should say is mark mason chief financial officer yes betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay and then just two other questions one on the tss business could you give us a sense as how you expect the business operates or performs in a declining interest rate environment if we look at the forward curve how should we expect tss to behave and then you mentioned some strong pipeline with initiatives for the clients maybe you could speak to that and i m kind of interested in understanding what you re planning on vis a vis the libra announcement that came out of facebook now i know libra it seems like it s more personal related but there is a c2b and a b2b element with that so wanted to understand what your plans are my basic question is why do we need libra it seems like you might have what companies need so maybe you can speak to that a little bit thanks mark mason chief financial officer yes i guess i ll start and then mike may want to chime in so just in terms of the tts business we obviously have seen very strong growth in the tts business over the past number of years and quarters and even this quarter with 7 growth which is probably a little bit lower than what we ve seen in prior years just as the rate increases have started to become fewer and now we move into a rate likely rate reduction the impact to tts is factored into at least the estimate that i gave you in terms of the impact of a 25 basis point reduction it obviously would have an impact on the growth rate but i would say that the majority of the growth rate that we ve experienced in our tts business is not tied toward not tied to the interest rate but instead tied toward growth that we ve had in both with multinational clients that are large and that we ve been with for a long time but also new emerging clients as they ventured into new markets new countries and we ve been there to assist them with how they kind of grow their businesses and operations in those new environments where whether it d be working capital or supply chain needs that they ve had and so i would expect to see continued growth in tts albeit at a slower pace in light of the rate environment but again our relationship with our clients are broader than just us taking their cash and holding your cash and we re offering them solutions that are a lot broader than just the rate that we pay them for cash the other piece that i mentioned is that we have been and will continue to invest in technology around our tts franchise it is obviously a very competitive space but it s one where we ve had a strong position for a long time it s been nicely growing it s very efficient it s high returning we re nicely entrenched with many of our customers and we ve got to continue to invest in the client experience in enabling faster cross border activity for those clients and so good growth i expect to see continued good growth requires investment we are in front of that investment to stay competitive and we ll continue to do so and i ll let mike kind of comment on some of the other piece as you mentioned michael corbat chief executive officer mark i would just to going back to tts for one second betsy operating in a declining rate environment is nothing new it s certainly not new in the us and you look at our tts business are operating around the world many many jurisdictions we operate we ve been in declining rate environments for period of time and i think the work the team has done moving from interest rate sensitive to more fee driven types of relationships has been helpful in that on your question pertaining to what s going on from a technology perspective in this case libra in particular one is i am not we are not dismissive at all of these we look at them and we study them as we ve said we were not are not part of the inaugural group i ve read the white paper several times at this point in time and again i look and there s i think some redeeming or there is some qualitative aspects that are appealing and i think there s others that might raise some questions and i think the way we think about it is that the market is moving and likely moving quickly toward 24 7 real time friction less ubiquitous global money movements and payments and that s just a reality and that s going to happen and i think we re pretty well positioned around that as i think of things like libra not a question of it that s when the digital currency comes it s a question is that currency one that kind of operates as a consortium or is it a federal reserve or is it a central bank backed type currency and i think we re preparing for a world where both of those where consumers businesses are going to have flexibility in terms of their choices of what they choose to use and our goal objective and mandate really is to be there with a system that s got the capacity to operate across all of those betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so a lot of times big tackled highlight friction in the system and opportunities they have to cut friction out meaning take out fee rates of legacy businesses could you speak to how you re thinking about that because i think some people might view you as a legacy business with margin that can be taken out how do you answer that kind of question michael corbat chief executive officer betsy i would probably break our businesses into two components i d break it into a consumer business and into an institutional payments business i think in the consumer business it s clear that interchanges an example is a friction that has existed for a period of time and as we ve seen elsewhere in the world will likely to continue to come down and so and i think that s one reason why you ve seen the disruptors or the innovators so focused on consumer versus institutional payments because on the institutional side there s really not much money in the pure movement of money it s in the operation of the operating account well yes you do get some flow but by the way libra has float and then their float as i ve read they re actually not paying that s where the partners are receiving their income there are frictions in foreign exchange there are frictions in terms of rates and other things that we combine with that but you ve got to have the back end that can provide those services in today s age not only provide them but provide them in a real time of scale way so again not dismissive but on the institutional side of things that from a payments perspective you ve got to have the full package it s not just a movement money is not the answer in there and so again not dismissive but and that s why the investments in areas like tts are so important that we re continuing to build out the front end we re continuing to take pain points out whether those frictions are in the forms of fees or money or probably to our customers benefit even more so in the form of onboarding and kind of all the frictions that come in terms of account opening and making sure that we re investing in bsa aml and those other pieces such that we can continue to distinguish ourselves with our clients as the place to go betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst great thank you operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america and erika your line is open erika najarian bank of america analyst yes hi can you hear me now mark mason chief financial officer yes good morning erika najarian bank of america analyst hi good morning thank you so much for answering the questions on your rotce targets maybe asking it a different way the market seems to be now expecting three rate cuts between now and the end of 2020 i think previously you ve set an efficiency goal of 53 for 2020 with 175 basis points of improvement in 19 and 225 basis points in 2020 and i m wondering if we do get three rate cuts and corporate activity remains at current levels is there enough productivity savings that you can identify to reiterate the efficiency targets as well mark mason chief financial officer yes look i mean we obviously the volatility around rate movement has been pretty significant over the past couple of quarters from from an increase to now a reduction and possibly three reductions and so if we had significant moves in rates we can kind of do the math as to what the implications would be i think we d also have to make some assumptions around those other factors that are in the environment and what happens with those whether it s trade and the tariffs et cetera in order to really have a fulsome answer in terms of what the implications would be on achieving a 13 5 and then being able to ascertain what levers we d be able to pull so it s a difficult question to answer as i sit here today as to whether which levers and how much of those levers we d be able to pull while protecting the things that mike and i have reference in still hitting a 13 5 i think to some extent i want to see how this first rate cut plays out and what the implications are for additional rate cuts again we could very well see as mike suggested the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses but we ve got to kind of wait and see how some of that plays out erika najarian bank of america analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst yeah morning mark mason chief financial officer morning brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst so a quick question on branded cards you said you expect to maintain the current mix between the full rate and promotional but i guess breaking that down are you still expecting migration to be occurring from the promotional to full rate and you re just going to be relying on promotional for loan balances going forward or more heavily relying on promotional balances going forward mark mason chief financial officer so in order to maintain the mix that we have we will need to continue to invest in promotional and bringing on promotional balances and so we will continue to do that they will continue we now we have obviously a track record of understanding how to do that and an understanding the timing for which it takes for them to convert and flip into average interest earning balances but we now are reaching a mix that we think is a healthy mix for us and in order to maintain that we will need to continue to invest brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then secondly you mentioned that you re seeing macro conditions are slowing in latin americas specifically mexico but there was additional levers you can pull on the expense side i mean what are examples of those additional levers that you have that are already in budget thanks mark mason chief financial officer in latin america and in mexico what we saw last year we saw expenses were up i want to say about 8 last year and what i referenced what i referenced this year or this quarter and last quarter was the growth that we were seeing in ebit and the growth that we re seeing in ebit is a byproduct in some ways of the investment spend that we made last year now starting to pay dividends so to speak through 2019 and so investments or the digital capabilities that we that we invested in from a technology point of view the organization or business model structure that we put in place in terms of our retail activity there and all of those things are starting to play out as expected we re about i don t know halfway through the investment plan that we announced a couple of years ago and we have the opportunity obviously to temper the remaining spend that was planned for to ensure that it s done consistent with the market opportunity that we see and so that obviously is a factor that would help on the expense line and then we are tempering growth in terms of loan activity loan volume in light of what s going on in the economy and that obviously helps at least as we think about expected cost of credit and what have you so those are a number of the factors that play out there brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay thanks operator your next question is from the line of marty mosby with vining sparks marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks for taking the questions this morning michael corbat chief executive officer sure good morning marty mosby vining sparks analyst to hit on the rotce targets again would success be reaching those goals in the fourth quarter of each of these years or would success be ultimate success actually for the whole year so as you re kind of envisioning that i kind of in my targets have you kind of reaching those by the end of each yea but you re really saying that you re going to be 13 5 average for the whole year of 2020 mark mason chief financial officer so the target that we ve set was for 12 was the full year return on tangible common equity target and as was the case for the 13 5 for 2020 marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then when you think about capital markets or institutional business it s been compressed or depressed for a while we keep thinking this is uncertainty in the marketplace or it s related to something that s causing a just a short term hit but is this somewhat more secular and when you start thinking about your goals for next year especially in 2020 are we assuming some of this pressure that we re in begins to release and can you give us any kind of feel for the estimate of what you re kind of assuming the uncertainty and that has had an impact on the short term capital markets types of businesses michael corbat chief executive officer sure marty what i would say is i think that there is part of it that is secular but today i would argue the majority of it is cyclical and what drives me to that statement is the intervention of central banks around the world and the amount of quantitative easing if you tell me the qe is just there forever then i would probably move toward the majority of it being secular but at some point these central banks have to start to back out of the market in terms of asset purchases in terms of liquidity and i actually think that there s going to be an opportunity for those that are there to step in and provide the liquidity and leadership on that front and again what you see is and you see you follow it closely you listen to what everybody says we re not measuring trading by the year we re not measuring it by the quarter trading in today s age is kind of day to day week to week month to month a change of sentiment out of the fed causes markets to react quickly and i think it s what makes the forecasting as either mark or i speak at these conferences so difficult you tend to kind of speak mid quarter and these things can change in either direction pretty quickly and so it s not a lack of engagement from a client perspective it s a lack of conviction and again i think we ve got the combination of that with a bit of overhang from an environmental perspective and clearly i think the central banks continuing to be actively involved and in some ways taking part of the role that ultimately the banks will need to play in the future mark mason chief financial officer and i think i d add to that as we see the pressures that we ve talked about impacting the trading businesses in many ways we re not just standing still as this happens and so you ve seen us announce kind of the reorganization if you will of our spread products or in our spread products area we recently announced under the new leadership end markets combining kind of our rates and currencies business both in an effort to ensure that we re better covering our clients and better positioned to cover our clients and you ll continue to see as markets evolve and as the industry evolves for us to constantly be looking at our business model for ways to improve it and to improve the effectiveness of it to improve the profitability and returns associated with it and so we re mindful of kind of how things are changing to mike s point they do appear to be cyclical in nature but we re constantly evaluating our businesses and trying to position ourselves effectively marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks that was very helpful and then lastly i wanted to ask you as we think of fed could begin to pull short term interest rates down are we preparing to be able to begin to lower deposit rates instead of actually increasing them so this has been a quick inflection point but do you think that you ll be able to offset some of the impact as you re able to pull those deposit rates back now michael corbat chief executive officer i mean look we ve seen we talked a little bit about earlier about the betas and how they vary from the corporate clients and commercial clients to the retail consumer client base and i think there are other important factors as rates start to move in a downward direction we have seen some of the players in the industry start to take rate down the other factors include the competitive landscape that s out there and how players decide to adjust their pricing but it also includes how you think about the relationship with the customer and if it is in fact more than just that deposit relationship that s going to factor into how you think about pricing strategy but i would imagine over time with a clarity on the direction that you will see betas respond over time marty mosby vining sparks analyst and historically we ve seen the backdrop of higher deposit betas and rates initially drop meaning you drop a little bit more and then eventually that has a slowdown kind of reverse of what we had on the way up so thanks for your answers today mark mason chief financial officer yes operator your final question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy rbc analyst good morning mark good morning mike mark mason chief financial officer good morning gerard gerard cassidy rbc analyst you guys did very well in the ccar this year in terms of the amount of capital that was reduced during the stress test i think you dropped about 500 basis points which was the lowest in maybe four or five years what was the primary driver was it obviously derisking the balance sheet but it wasn t primarily coming from citi holdings falling off and then second if it continues to go this way would you consider lowering your cet1 capital ratio your target that is mark mason chief financial officer yes so as mike kind of alluded to earlier there are couple of factors that are involved in the cet1 ratio just taking that part of the question first and obviously we ve had a management buffer that is included there of about 100 basis points we have kind of a 3 placeholder in terms of the scb and we are getting more clarity on that it seems like in some of the recent commentary and as we get more clarity on the scb proposal and other proposals and it takes out the risk of variability to how we think about capital planning we will certainly take a look at the 11 5 and see that that still makes sense in terms of the ask that we made of the 21 5 billion and what was approved we obviously ran our scenario with an eye toward the targets that were set 11 5 billion in this base case but also ensuring we can achieve at least the minimums during a stress scenario and the mix of assets that we have on the balance sheet we ve been thoughtful first about the client needs through the course of 2018 with an eye toward what the implication would be from a stress point of view as we go into a ccar cycle and the longer term planning of the business and ensure that we ended the year in a place again that allow for us to serve those needs but was mindful of the return necessary in light of stress losses that may be a byproduct of those types of assets and so that s what kind of played out through the scenario and through the asset we ultimately made gerard cassidy rbc analyst very good and mark can you remind us are they still implementing the operating risk capital charge for a company just like yours that have exited businesses but you still being access to capital charge for those businesses even though you re not in them mark mason chief financial officer yes gerard cassidy rbc analyst very good michael corbat chief executive officer uprisk rwa gerard cassidy rbc analyst and how much is that for you folks that has cautioned you in terms of capital mark mason chief financial officer i don t think we break that michael corbat chief executive officer we haven t broken them gerard cassidy rbc analyst okay is there any color do you think coming from the new regulatory regime to maybe give you and your peers some relief in this area michael corbat chief executive officer i don t i think so mark mason chief financial officer i don t think so michael corbat chief executive officer i think if you look across if we look across the industry peers it s pretty consistent and that hasn t been contemplated mark mason chief financial officer and just to be clear i think you know this but we are looking at or we utilized kind of a basel iii standardized as it relates to our risk weighted assets right that is the metric that is involved there gerard cassidy rbc analyst very good and then shifting over to the institutional clients group mike i think you touched on in the markets area that there is some cyclical factors affecting you talked about this the quantitative easing in terms of secular in the cash equities area did you guys see much of the mifid ii changes affecting your cash equity business this quarter michael corbat chief executive officer this quarter no no again i think that over the kind of glide path of implementations there really haven t we haven t seen really many surprises and we actually went into this and continue to believe that we ve got the ability as clients kind of rationalize the counterparties to people that they deal with the cities in a position to be a winner in that and i think we continue i think as you ve seen us continue to kind of climb up the tables continue to take share there gerard cassidy rbc analyst great and then just to tie it in can you guys give us a flavor for the investment banking pipeline how does it look at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter mark mason chief financial officer i guess again on investment banking kind of as you saw in the numbers we ended down 10 but better than what i talked about at morgan stanley the strength we saw in the end at the end of the quarter was really a pull forward with both some ecm activity as well as in m a that said the dialog that we have with clients in investment banking remains strong and fully engaged and quite constructive and we ve seen particular strength in the us m a activity continue and so we kind of go into the balance of the year feeling good again about that dialog but also recognizing our all these factors that we talked about influences the corporate sentiment and willingness to take action michael corbat chief executive officer and george you know when i think of it it s in some ways it s the pipelines are fine the pipelines are in pretty good shape but what s the market willing to accept what can get priced on what terms and so i think the pipelines are there i think the question is in what ways are the markets open to get those deals done gerard cassidy rbc analyst great thank you for the

china s economic growth sank to its lowest level in at least 26 years in the quarter ending in june adding to pressure on chinese leaders as they fight a tariff war with washington the world s second largest economy grew 6 2 over a year ago down from the previous quarter s 6 4 government data showed monday forecasters expected china s economy to rebound in late 2018 but pushed back that target after president donald trump hiked tariffs on chinese imports to pressure beijing over its technology development tactics now economists say the slowdown might extend into next year mr trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed last month to resume negotiations on the fight that has battered exporters on both sides but economists warn their truce is fragile because they still face the same array of disputes that caused talks to break down in may the trade war is having a huge impact on the chinese economy edward moya of oanda said in a report as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress we are probably not near the bottom for china s economy chinese leaders have stepped up spending and bank lending to keep growth within this year s official target range of 6 to 6 5 and avert politically dangerous job losses but they face an avalanche of unexpectedly bad news including plunging auto sales in the second half of the year the external environment may still be more complicated said a government spokesman mao shengyong at a news conference quarterly growth was the lowest since china began reporting such data in 1993 according to an employee of the press office of the national bureau of statistics dong hui in 2009 the nbs reported growth of 6 1 for the first three months of that year however mr dong said that later was revised up to 6 4 jittery consumers are

and 6 year old daughters and two elderly relatives the burden to support the family is fairly heavy said ms qiu we rarely travel and have no plans to because of financial conditions the fight between the two biggest global traders has disrupted sales of goods from soybeans to medical equipment and rattled financial markets the biggest factor in the latest chinese economic weakness is lackluster activity in construction and industry according to julian evans pritchard of capital economics he said that was likely to worsen because a boom in real estate development is fading combined with increasing headwinds from u s tariffs and weaker global growth we expect this to culminate in a further slowdown in economic growth over the coming year mr evans pritchard said in a report beijing is pumping money into the economy through higher spending on building highways and other public works that has shored up growth but set back efforts to reduce reliance on investment which has pushed debt to levels that prompted credit rating agencies to cut china s credit rating for government borrowing spending on factories real estate and other fixed assets rose 5 8 in the first half of the year up

david fickling to outsiders it may seem like the deepening rift between japan and south korea has blown up out of a clear blue sky for all the wrangling over the legacy of japan s 35 year colonization of the korean peninsula which ended in 1945 there s far more on paper to join than to separate them both are northeast asian democracies that have close military and economic ties to the us potent exports of electronics cars and cultural products and a love of seafood and beef after decades when postwar growth gave japan the far wealthier population its stagnation in recent decades has even put the two countries at roughly equivalent levels of gross domestic product per capita 40 479 for korea versus 43 349 in japan for all that though there s no strong web of ties binding these two nations disputes over restitution for koreans forced into slavery under japanese occupation are now hurting korean sales of fast retailing clothing in turn the government in tokyo has moved to curb exports of specialty materials to korea s technology giants compare the japan korea relationship to those between european countries or the members of the north american free trade association or even stereotypically unfriendly neighbors like argentina and brazil and you could be mistaken for thinking the two countries were locked in a cold war already just 7 5 percent of korea s 1 07 trillion in bilateral trade is with japan making the european union the us and china more important partners the picture is even more dramatic in the other direction japan s 80 billion in bilateral trade with korea amounts to just 5 8 percent of its 1 38 trillion total that would seem to go against economic theory the gravity model of trade predicts that commerce between two countries is largely a result of their respective outputs and the physical distance between them two large and adjacent economies ought to be quite closely integrated that s not what s happened japan s exports to korea are far less than the gravity model would predict and the same is true in the opposite direction foreign direct investment statistics paint a similar picture the stock of korean assets in japan in 2012 was about 1 8 percent of its outbound stock and a smaller sum than could be found in canada vietnam india or germany not to mention the us china and hong kong which together account for almost half the total japanese investments in korea similarly come to about 2 5 percent of its total well behind brazil thailand singapore or australia the cold war even shows up in foreign exchange markets trading between the korean won and the japanese yen is so slight that the bank for international settlements doesn t even list turnover on the currency pair although it does have data for the yen against the australian new zealand and canadian dollars the turkish lira the south african rand and the brazilian real human factors underline the chilly relationship more japanese migrate to the uk australia and brunei than to korea while koreans represent the largest migrant group in japan softbank group corp founder masoyoshi son is of korean japanese heritage as is lotte shopping co chairman shin dong bin and former korean president lee myung bak they face prejudice even after generations of residency tokyo s longtime gov shintaro ishihara was reelected multiple times after making notorious derogatory remarks against people hailing from japan s former colonies in a 2000 speech a 2011 protest by right wing groups against korean pop culture in the city reportedly attracted more than 2 000 demonstrators for its part korea banned japanese cultural products outright until 1998 ties aren t improving much more japanese vacationed in korea in 2009 than in 2018 japanese have fallen from about two fifths of total visitors there a decade ago to around a fifth last year despite a modest recovery in the past couple of years in one sense such links shouldn t matter the golden arches doctrine that globalization inevitably begets peace and no two countries with a mcdonald s have ever gone to war has never really held true nonetheless a more limited version of that view has merit close links in finance migration and culture may not prevent war but they can at least provide a countervailing force when tensions flare something that seems to have kept relations between singapore and malaysia china and taiwan and even the us and china far more stable than one might have predicted the alternative of cold peace pursued by india and pakistan offers a more fraught path japan and korea both dwarfed in their neighborhood by an increasingly confident china ought to work harder to deepen their mutual ties it s better to stand together than to fall apart david fickling is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering commodities as well as industrial and consumer companies
weekly outlook fed and trump set the tone for future dollar weakness the big thing in the market this past week was fed chair powell s semi annual testimony to congress his prepared statement was generally downbeat focusing on the problems facing the us economy often in a yes but fashion the economy is doing well however inflation is well below target gdp is growing at a strong pace however the components of growth are worrisome he even mentioned the debt ceiling and brexit everything possible that might cause them to ease later in the q a sessions on both days he delivered more hints that they would cut rates asked specifically whether friday s good nfp figure changed anything he replied no the bottom line for me is that the uncertainties around global growth and trade continue to weigh on the outlook in addition inflation continues to be muted and those things are still in place on the second day he said i think we have signaled and central banks around the world are seeing weakness everywhere and they re also providing more accommodation we ve signaled that we re open to doing that what more do people want before powell s text was released on wednesday the market was pricing in a 5 chance of no cut at the july meeting a 95 chance of a 25 bps cut and no chance of a 50 bps cut now the market sees an 83 chance of a 25 bps cut and a 17 chance of a 50 bps cut all told the market now sees a 58 chance of 75 bps or more of easing this year and only a 42 chance of 50 bps or less the increasing likelihood that rate cuts this year will be deeper than expected should cause the dollar to weaken further in my view adding to the dollar s woes are signs that the administration is getting serious about trying to devalue the currency cnbc reported that trump has asked aides to find a way to weaken the dollar in order to boost the economy ahead of next year s presidential elections trump has also reportedly asked questions about the dollar while interviewing nominees for the fed board of governors positions the reports say that treasury secretary mnuchin and chief economic advisor kudlow don t approve of such efforts but we all know how closely trump listens to his advisors just ask former secretary of defense mattis or former secretary of state tillerson while mnuchin and kudlow may be opposed to it these two don t seem to me to be the type to resign over a point of honor and even if they do i m sure someone in the administration could be found to pull the trigger did you see the video of the justice department lawyer arguing in court that the federal government doesn t have to provide soap toothbrushes or even beds to detained children apprehended at the us mexico border even though the law requires the government to keep detainees in safe and sanitary facilities the risk of even verbal intervention to get the dollar down poses a significant threat to the dollar as most other governments long ago stopped talking about exchange rates the dollar was higher for much of the week bolstered by the afterglow from friday s nonfarm payrolls but after powell s commentary it ended the week lower indicators next week us retail sales china gdp uk cpi japan cpi and upper house election the coming week doesn t have that much in the way of major economic indicators most of them concern britain where politics not economics is determining the fate of the currency there are two major political events robert mueller s testimony to the house judiciary committee on wednesday and japan s upper house election on sunday the 21st there are no major central bank meetings for the us the main indicator will be us retail sales on tuesday this is an important indicator given the nature of the us economy but it s unlikely to be decisive in determining whether the fed moves 25 or 50 bps and therefore isn t going to be that important for the fx market the empire state manufacturing index and the philaelphia fed business sentiment index are also coming out they re both expected to rise which would be good news last month s figures were pointing to a below 50 ism manufacturing pmi the forecast for this month s figures indicate a steady ism at around 51 7 which would tend to be bullish for usd as for mr mueller s testimony i doubt if he ll say anything more that isn t in the report or even if he ll give more of a sense of his view on the affairs in question nonetheless it could tip the scales in the house and force the democrats to start impeachment proceedings which could damage the dollar if you haven t read mueller s report which i admit i haven t you can read a version of it turned into an illustrated novel here monday morning while those of us in europe are still busy knitting up the raveled sleeve of care china announces four major indicators fixed asset investment fia industrial production retail sales and the all important china q2 gdp it s expected to slow slightly to 6 3 yoy from 6 4 the target for this year is a range of 6 0 6 5 down from about 6 5 last year the market s estimate of 6 3 would certainly be within that target range and so wouldn t necessitate any policy response but it could raise fears of slightly less activity in china risk negative the third week of the month always sees a number of british indicators to wit the employment data on tuesday consumer price index cpi on wednesday and retail sales on thursday cpi is clearly the most important one the expected figure headline cpi expected to stay at exactly the target level of 2 0 for another month would ordinarily play into the hands of those on the monetary policy committee mpc who are in favor of a gradual normalization hike of interest rates however the bank is basing its forecasts on the assumption of a smooth brexit deal while the market is more realistically assuming some variant of disaster hence the zero probability of a hike vs a 60 probability of a cut by august next year i think a figure that shows at least no acceleration in inflation would allow the mpc to move to a more dovish bias as boe gov carney has hinted at and would therefore be negative for sterling but the sad fact is that the fate of gbp is more in the hands of the feckless british government and the soon to be elected conservative party leader who automatically becomes prime minister this is a race between tweedledum and tweedledummer at least insofar as their unrealistic brexit policies are concerned actually one of the candidates jeremy hunt seems to have an ok cv and decent reputation but the other fellow boorish johnson no that s not a typo has a reputation as a buffon i have to say i have never read anything good about him except that he s supposed to be rather witty if you re looking for someone to invite to a dinner party in particular his views on brexit seem to be a combination of wishful thinking willful ignorance and out and out lies in other words he s a cutting edge politician for this day and age voting for the party leader began on july 6th among the conservative party s 160 000 members the final deadline for voting is next sunday the 21st the winner is expected to be announced on july 23th and pm may will tender her resignation on the 24th then we will sing god save the queen in earnest because she will certainly need saving japan has its trade figures out on thursday and the national cpi on friday i m not sure how much interest the national cpi is to traders nowadays since the tokyo cpi for the relevant month comes out three weeks earlier nonetheless this is the one that the bank of japan is presumeably looking at so it s the one that matters for policy makers as usual it s expected to show little change in the inflation situation the headline and the core core ex fresh foods and energy rates of inflation are expected to remain unchanged while the japan style core excluding fresh foods only is expected to slow negligibly given that the tokyo cpi for june rose at the same pace as in may too this should come as no surprise jpy neutral advertisement

china s economy is growing at its slowest pace since at least 1992 china s economic growth decelerated to its slowest pace in decades weakened by trade tensions with the u s and businesses that held back from making big investments despite encouragement from beijing the economy grew by 6 2 in the second quarter down from 6 4 in the period before official statistics showed monday growth was slower than the 6 3 on year rate forecast by economists investments remained weak on a quarterly basis even though the month of june saw the beginning of a potential recovery as beijing encouraged banks to lend more exports fell in june from a year earlier after trade talks with washington broke down and president trump applied higher tariffs to chinese goods the figures show how beijing s strategy to stimulate the economy by cutting 2 trillion yuan 291 billion in taxes and fees is falling short in unveiling them in march premier li keqiang called the cuts a fair and efficient way to alleviate the struggles of companies domestic sentiment in the quarter was held hostage by the twists and turns of the trade dispute an impasse in negotiations shattered hopes for a deal in late may and chinese businesses are worried that the two nations can t resolve their differences even as their mr trump and chinese president xi jinping got talks back on track in the waning days of june there should be big volatility in china s economy right now said ting lu chief china economist at nomura international the tax cuts probably aren t having a big effect on sentiment he said china s economy is growing at its slowest pace since at least 1992 when official records for quarterly growth started to be published economists expect beijing to relax controls more on borrowing to reach its targeted gdp growth of between 6 to 6 5 this year mao shengyong a spokesman at the national bureau of statistics said china had sufficient policy reserves to stabilize the economy in the second half including additional tax cuts and efforts to boost infrastructure investment investment in bridges roads and other infrastructure rose 5 8 in the first half of the year compared with 5 6 during the first five months factory output was up 6 3 in june from a year earlier compared with 5 3 in may still economists doubt that a recovery of such activity in june according to the official data was sustainable nomura calculated that factory output was up 5 6 on a quarterly basis in the april to june period compared with 6 5 in the first quarter liu li gang an economist at citigroup said the pickup in june was due to a surge in new loans manufacturing investment growth of below 6 for at least two consecutive months pulled down overall quarterly growth he said fei xiangping a marketing specialist of superstar shenzhen automation co which produces battery packs for electric vehicles and cellphones says business has been tough due to a protracted slump in china s automobile market the prospect of the new energy industry should be good in the long run but we just hit the wall this year she said ms fei said her company makes battery packs for domestic car makers like chery automobile co and zhejiang geely holding group co as well as for chinese mobile phone makers like oppo and vivo she hopes the government will introduce more favorable policies to encourage domestic consumption especially with regards to auto purchases without more supporting measures it would be difficult for us for years ahead another promising data point in june was consumption with better than expected retail sales zhu haibin an economist with j p morgan said higher sales of automobiles drove retail growth and would boost consumption in the second half beijing has for months encouraged cities to spend and embarked on credit loosening measures but the economy has been slow to react analysts say local governments are holding back from starting projects for fear of being held responsible by the communist party for amassing more debt such austerity might bode well for china s financial well being in the long run but high speed rail highways and other national level projects won t be enough to lift infrastructure investment growth in the second half of the year they say meanwhile sentiment has been weighed down by uncertainty in the u s china trade dispute exports fell 1 3 in june from a year earlier after rising 1 1 in may according to official data released last week economists say beijing may be forced further loosen monetary policy even though that could push up debt levels after staying roughly stable last year debt reached 247 of china s 13 trillion economy at the end of march up 5 percentage points from the end of 2018 according to macquarie group zhu ning a professor at the national institute of financial research at tsinghua university said cutting banks reserve requirement ratios or cutting benchmark interest rates would risk pressuring the value of the chinese

beijing china s economic growth slowed to 6 2 percent in the second quarter its weakest pace in at least 27 years as demand at home and abroad faltered in the face of mounting u s trade pressure while more upbeat june factory output and retail sales offered signs of improvement some analysts cautioned the gains may not be sustainable and expect beijing will continue to roll out more support measures in coming months china s trading partners and financial markets are closely watching the health of the world s second largest economy as the sino u s trade war gets longer and costlier growth data on july 15 marked a loss of momentum for the economy from the first quarter s 6 4 percent adding to expectations that beijing needs to do more to boost consumption and investment and restore business confidence the april june pace in line with analysts expectations was the slowest since the first quarter of 1992 the earliest quarterly data on record china s growth could slow to 6 percent

rrr is still very likely as the authorities want to support the real economy in the long run he said predicting the economy would continue to slow before stabilizing around mid 2020 china has already slashed rrr six times since early 2018 to free up more funds for lending and analysts polled by reuters forecast two more cuts by the end of this year beijing has leaned largely on fiscal stimulus to underpin growth this year announcing massive tax cuts worth nearly 2 trillion yuan 291 billion and a quota of 2 15 trillion yuan for special bond issuance by local governments aimed at boosting infrastructure construction the economy has been slow to respond however and business sentiment remains cautious trade pressures have intensified since washington sharply raised tariffs on chinese

it could either help pakistan stay afloat or it could just be a show of solidarity towards regional security the united states has foolishly given pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies deceit thinking of our leaders as fools they give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in afghanistan with little help no more donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 1 2018 of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center president clinton famously missed his shot we paid pakistan billions of dollars they never told us he was living there fools donald j trump realdonaldtrump november 19 2018 trump s false assertions add insult to the injury pak has suffered in us wot in terms of lives lost destabilised economic costs he needs to be informed abt historical facts pak has suffered enough fighting us s war now we will do what is best for our people our interests imran khan imrankhanpti november 19 2018 what will undoubtedly be of interest is the sight of imran and president donald trump finally coming face to face after their tense exchange on twitter last year trump s vocal criticism last year of pakistan s alleged record on counter terrorism and failure to assist the us prompted a speedy response from imran who reminded him of the great human and economic losses suffered by the country during the war on terror despite longstanding intelligence and military cooperation including pakistan s provision of key logistics routes into afghanistan for us forces trump s claim that islamabad knew the whereabouts of al qaeda leader osama bin laden marked a definitive blow to the nations steadily deteriorating relationship the trump administration s cutback of military training programmes for officers in pakistan alongside cancelling reimbursements from the coalition support fund csf are what the us deems to be pressurising tactics aimed at compelling pakistan to change its behaviour since then pakistan has been teetering on the brink of bankruptcy with plummeting foreign exchange reserves a stubborn trade deficit and its currency at an all time low against the dollar its subsequent reliance on the international monetary fund imf and friendly nations for loan packages has perhaps led the us to reconsider its retributive stance aware that any bailout could go straight into beijing s pockets therefore urging pakistan to stay committed to the afghan peace process remains as high a priority as ever especially since the taliban have regained considerable territorial control and violence in the country has worsened consequently rebuilding ties with its historic ally has become an appealing prospect for pakistan with mutual acknowledgment that their relationship is on the mend once more imran s upcoming visit is expected to entail discussions on security energy and trade pakistan s recent involvement in the afghan peace process including hosting talks in bhurban last month has proved to observers in washington that its influence can facilitate discourse between the north atlantic treaty organisation nato backed ashraf ghani government and the taliban if indeed this is evidence of pakistan s changed behaviour then a productive meeting between the two leaders could pave the way for a resumption in dialogues about defence possibly leading to pakistan becoming eligible to obtain reimbursements from the csf as pakistan navigates its way through an economic crisis it must foster an environment that attracts more foreign direct investment and not just foreign aid which will come with security improved industry an increase in exports and several other domestic reforms it must be noted that bilateral trade between the us and pakistan reached a record high of 6 6 billion last year subject to pakistan implementing further economic reforms us investment could continue to rise although the specific agenda of imran s visit has not been made public yet onlookers are hopeful that both countries will be able to look past recent hiccups and appeal to their long term common interests the personalities of both leaders have captured international attention with fleeting similarities often being drawn between their unconventional backgrounds as celebrities and their competence as politicians given their contrasting charismas it will be interesting to observe the dynamic between imran and trump especially considering the latter s tendency to flout presidential etiquette and develop bonds with even the most unlikely of characters such as kim jong un imran s sobriety matched with trump s brashness could either help strike some useful dialogue that could tangibly improve pakistan s economic trajectory or it could be nothing more than a show of solidarity amidst the countries continued partnership in regional security in an era of multi polarity with power being distributed amongst old new and rising giants pakistan will need to maximise its support from a range of allies in order to stay afloat heated twitter exchanges aside imran s visit to washington affirms this need and also demonstrates america s eagerness to retain its diminishing influence in the continent
raise the debt ceiling let s eliminate it instead the trump administration is warning congress that we will need to raise the debt ceiling by september congress should take this as an opportunity to eliminate it entirely doug mataconis 9 comments treasury secretary steve mnuchin is warning congress that the united states is likely to reach the limits of the current debt ceiling in the coming months washington treasury secretary steven mnuchin informed congressional leaders on friday that the government could run out of money in early september pleading with lawmakers to reach a deal to raise the government s borrowing limit before their august recess or risk a potentially catastrophic default mr mnuchin in a letter to leadership said that while it is impossible to identify precisely how long the treasury s resources can last updated predictions indicated that there is a scenario in which we run out of cash in early september before congress reconvenes as such mr mnuchin wrote i request that congress increase the debt ceiling before congress leaves for summer recess he and speaker nancy pelosi of california have spoken by phone multiple times this week including a 20 minute conversation on friday afternoon about federal spending caps and raising the debt ceiling to prevent governmentwide spending cuts they agreed that they would most likely speak again over the weekend according to a democratic leadership aide i am personally convinced that we should act on the caps and the debt ceiling ms pelosi told reporters on thursday evening in between phone calls with the mr mnuchin prior to recess negotiations between lawmakers and administration officials on capitol hill have intensified as the threat of what could be a disastrous fiscal crisis grows closer there is little appetite for what could be a politically tense stand alone vote to raise the debt ceiling and lawmakers do not want to approve a stopgap spending bill that keeps the money flowing for a year but does not reflect congress s changing priorities but only a handful of working days remain for both chambers before the august break i am very concerned that time is running very short said senator susan collins republican of maine and a member of the senate appropriations committee the last thing i want to see is either a government shutdown or a one year continuing resolution the idea of a one year continuing resolution the congressional term for a short term spending bill has been widely panned on capitol hill with 15 senate republicans sending a letter this month urging administration officials to avoid it but with divided government the fate of a deal largely rests with ms pelosi who will have to wrangle the moderate and liberal factions of her majority and president trump who has proved to be an unpredictable factor in spending negotiations it s time that we got serious on a bipartisan basis to try to work this out and not have the kind of chaos that goes along with our inability to come together on these kind of important issues said senator mitch mcconnell republican of kentucky and the majority leader at a news conference on tuesday the federal government has already run a 747 billion budget deficit for the 2019 fiscal year which ends in september a 23 percent increase from the year before that is an unusually large increase given the strength of economic growth total personal and corporate income tax levels are down slightly from the previous year treasury department statistics show federal spending has risen particularly for national defense and health care programs and so have the interest costs on the growing national debt those trends reflect washington s free spending ways and the rising costs of an aging population as the baby boom generation draws social security and medicare benefits those dynamics have yet to prompt a renewed interest in the deficit but they are intensifying pressure on lawmakers to raise the debt limit or risk economic catastrophe if they do not a 2018 budget deal in congress suspended the limit which constrains the amount of money the government may borrow to continue paying its bills until this past march 1 once that deadline passed the treasury department was forced to begin employing extraordinary measures in order to maintain the borrowing needed to keep paying soldiers issuing social security checks and otherwise funding the government those measures include premature redemption of treasury bonds owned by federal employees retirement accounts borrowing cash set aside to smooth exchange rate fluctuations and stopping contributions to some government pension funds mr mnuchin s letter is a warning that those sleight of the balance sheet efforts cannot last forever when the treasury department runs out of them it will not have enough money coming in to pay its spending obligations that would necessitate either sharp and immediate spending cuts or a government default on some of its obligations not paying workers contractors lenders or citizens it owes money to economists generally warn that such a default would at minimum destabilize the economy and raise future government borrowing costs in a worst case it could shock the economy into recession after a debt ceiling crisis that nearly brought the country to the brink of default in the summer of 2011 after the gop had taken control house the issue of the debt ceiling has mostly faded into the background of the ongoing fiscal debate on capitol hill to a large degree the credit for this goes to republican leadership in the house and the senate that had apparently decided that it would not allow itself to be held hostage by the house freedom caucus and other groups that sought to use the debt ceiling debate as a means of forcing budget cuts or other measures that had nothing to do with the debt ceiling itself on some occasions this has been accomplished by increasing the debt ceiling itself on others it has been accomplished via measures that effectively suspended it for a given period of time that last extension passed as noted at the beginning of march and in the time that has passed the treasury department has worked around the debt limit via accounting measures and other means these measures have allowed the federal government to continue spending even though the limits of the debt ceiling had technically speaking been breached those measures however can only last so long and as mnuchin notes in his letter to speaker pelosi we will likely reach the point where those measures will no longer be feasible in september which also happens to be the month during which congress must pass a new budget for fiscal year 2020 this is why mnuchin is asking congress to deal with this matter prior to leaving for a six week summer break at the end of july instead of kicking the can down the road again though congress should use this as an opportunity to take the one step that would guarantee that we d never have a debt ceiling crisis ever again i am speaking of course of the idea of eliminating the debt ceiling entirely the idea of eliminating the need for frequent debt ceiling votes is not a new one economists and political pundits on both sides of the aisle have argued for some time that placing a legislative limit on the federal government s ability to pay its bills and float debt when necessary makes no sense either politically or economically from a political point of view it gives congress far too much power over the executive branch in general and treasury department policy and procedures specifically by requiring an administration to continually seek congressional permission to do something that at least ostensibly appears as though it ought to be far more discretionary than current law allows it to be economically the fact that the debt limit has frequently become a bargaining chip in broader power struggles between congress and the white house over fiscal policy introduces an element of uncertainty into the economy that makes financial markets nervous and potentially could have a negative impact on both bond and stock values as well as the value of the dollar and on international trade as we saw during the debt ceiling showdown in the summer of 2011 such showdowns also have a negative impact on the economy generally and have even led rating agencies to downgrade their quality assessment of u s government bonds and treasury bills finally the existence of a debt ceiling also hands legislative minorities an inordinate amount of bargaining power in that enhances their ability to extract concessions at a time when passing legislation extending the debt ceiling is most essential opponents of past proposals to eliminate the debt ceiling argue that eliminating the debt ceiling would lead to an explosion in debt that would be catastrophic for the economy but this argument is undermined by reality in several key respects primarily of course there s the fact that the existence of the debt ceiling has done little to control the explosion of either the annual budget deficit or the increases in the national debt that have become commonplace the national debt has essentially doubled under the presidencies of every president going back to ronald reagan with the only exception to that rule being george h w bush since he only served for four years this occurred notwithstanding the fact that the issue of raising the debt limit has been debated on yearly semi yearly or more frequent intervals throughout the time each of these men was in office clearly then the existence of a law requiring congress to vote on a debt ceiling limit did nothing to control the growth of the national debt additionally it s worth noting that the united states did not have a debt ceiling law until 1917 and the reasons for it coming to existence are fairly interesting the debt ceiling was first enacted in 1917 why the date tells all we were about to enter the great war to fund that effort the wilson government needed to issue liberty bonds this was controversial and the debt ceiling was cover passed to reassure the rubes that congress would be responsible even while the country went to war it was from the beginning an exercise in bad faith and has remained so every single second to the present day clearly the existence of a debt ceiling law has done nothing to slow the growth of national debt and instead appears to have increased the pace of its growth over the course of the 100 years that it has been in effect given that there appears to be little good reason to keep it in effect now the fact that debt ceiling has done nothing to stop the growth of the national debt really shouldn t be a surprise because that s basically what it is intended to do judging from the ny times coverage of the 1917 episode legislators paid little attention to the implications of mandating a ceiling they focused instead on treasury secretary mcadoo s request for a higher borrowing limit so as to fund an expensive war effort the ceiling was created to empower not rein in treasury prompting a failed effort to create a congressional committee to oversee treasury s actions similarly the creation of the aggregate ceiling in 1939 reflected congressional deference to treasury granting the department flexibility in refinancing short term notes with longer term bonds as the senate floor debate makes clear senators viewed the move as removing a partition in the law that hampered treasury s ability to manage the debt in other words the debt ceiling law was intended to take the issue of the issuance of federal debt out of the hands of congress and place it in the hands of the treasury department in order to make it easier for the federal government to issue debt more importantly the debt ceiling is not the way to control either federal spending or the growth of the federal government for that to happen congress needs to exercise restraint where it matters at the appropriations stage where the federal government and its various departments are granted the authority to spend money to begin with congress already possesses the authority to authorize any federal spending that is necessary to pay for the nation s obligations if congress were truly concerned about the level of the national debt it would focus not on the borrowing power of the treasury department but on the fact that it continues to authorize massive increases in spending at all levels of government on programs of dubious merit additionally the law as it currently exists does little other than to allow politicians on both sides of the aisle to pander to interest groups and voters back home by claiming that the voted to control spending because they voted against a debt ceiling increase if they were truly interested in controlling spending they would act at the point when it matters when congress is actually voting on the budget and on the appropriations bills for the various parts of the government itself the fact that they choose the route of grandstanding over doing something that would actually have an impact on federal spending and the growth of government should give the reader all the information they need to determine their true intentions as a political matter of course it s unlikely that the political will exists in congress exists to eliminate the debt ceiling especially since such a move can easily if improperly be spun into a move that will increase the debate as we ve seen though that isn t the case and more importantly the history of the 102 years or so during which a debt ceiling has existed has seen the largest increase in public debt in american history therefore the idea that the debt ceiling can control spending is simply untrue in the end it s likely that the republicans and democrats on capitol hill will find a way to quietly raise the debt ceiling just as they have in the past before we get there though it s looking like we may have to put up with another showdown between members of congress who recognize that authorizing the federal government to pay the bill for things that congress has already authorized it to spend money on and the debt kamikazes who think that playing with the financial integrity of the nation is a way to advance their political position
for some time the four horsemen of us macroeconomic policymaking have been taxation regulation trade and infrastructure having studied the first in detail i have found tax cuts to be a positive contributor to economic growth though i have considered the second area in less detail the evidence suggests that regulation is at best only a minor contributor to growth the third area is very important which is why today s trade tensions are so worrying the fourth area exists only in rhetoric an infrastructure programme is currently not a part of the macroeconomic policy repertoire in the first area i estimate that the 2017 tax legislation added 1 1 per cent per year to the united states gdp growth rate for 2018 19 of that 0 9 percentage points reflected the reduced tax rate on individuals whereas 0 2 percentage points derived from the rate cuts and improved expensing provisions for businesses while the growth enhancing effect of the tax cuts for individuals is not expected to continue beyond 2019 the impact of the corporate tax reform will likely persist for some time to come as for the second horseman there is some indication that the expansion of federal regulations has begun to taper off after undergoing a long period of growth as of 2017 regdata which tracks the number of words relating to constraints on economic activity in the federal register shows that new regulations have plateaued the regulatory burden on business and economic activity is no longer rising but it is not diminishing either likewise the world bank s doing business profile for the us which offers a broader measure of government regulation based on an average of 10 indicators show no recent progress the us rose from eighth place in 2016 to sixth place in 2017 in the global ranking only to fall back to eighth in 2018 and putting aside relative performance a cardinal representation of the underlying indicators shows virtually no change in the 2016 2018 period as many other economists have noted us president donald trump s trade policies are a major concern the administration s trade agenda is driven by the discredited mercantilist idea that selling stuff exports is good and buying stuff imports is bad the irony is that trump and some of his top trade advisers share this misguided view with the chinese indeed the trump administration is correct that the chinese have long restricted imports and foreign investment while engaging in technology theft either directly or by compelling transfers but the tit for tat exchange of import tariffs between the us and china over the past year is bad for both countries many assume that the trade conflict will hurt china more than the us given that china exports far more to america than america exports to china but the loss of chinese imports will impose a major burden on the us economy trump s views on tariffs remind me of a speech that ronald reagan gave at stanford s hoover institution before he became president reagan argued that tariffs on steel and other goods were justified on national security grounds his reasoning criticised by audience members was almost the same as trump s today yet to justify his tariffs trump has gone even further equating national security with economic security the best way to invalidate that argument on legal grounds then is simply to have an economist show in court why tariffs are bad for economic security the broader problem is that trump seems to have a personal affection for tariffs partly because he thinks they raise revenue and partly because he thinks they raise gdp by curbing imports which are then magically replaced by domestic production this challenge does not admit of an easy remedy some have called on congress to reassert its authority over tariffs at least by limiting the national security argument but this could have unintended long term consequences given that presidents since the 1930s have tended to be far more supportive of free trade than have members of congress each of whom represents the interests of a narrower constituency the hope now is that mutually harmful tariffs will lead to an agreement whereby china liberalises its trade policies at which point import barriers will be removed but though this to add irony to irony would benefit china more than the us the situation is fraught with uncertainty about the outcome fuelling the volatility of global stock markets and whatever happens with china we still have to worry that trump will impose tariffs on mexico europe japan and so on as for infrastructure the potential benefits to us productivity from increased investment are real yet nothing has happened the situation is best encapsulated by an april meeting between trump and congressional leaders according to media reports trump began by proposing to spend 1 trillion on infrastructure whereupon the democrats countered by suggesting 2 trillion trump apparently agreed to that with little hesitation all in all the exchange confirms once again that both parties have come to regard government spending as a free lunch at least when it is financed by debt or the creation of new money perhaps it is actually for the best that infrastructure week never goes anywhere given the state of us macroeconomic policy it is not surprising that the federal reserve bank of atlanta s latest gdpnow report forecasts second quarter gdp growth of 1 3 per cent down from 3 1 per cent in the first quarter the 2017 tax reform would still be promoting economic growth if not for the escalating
