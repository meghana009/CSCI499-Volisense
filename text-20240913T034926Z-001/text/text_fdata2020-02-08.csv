because of the size of the chinese economy significant distress in china could spill over to u s and global markets through a retrenchment of risk appetite u s dollar appreciation and declines in trade and commodity prices the u s central bank wrote in its semi annual report to congress released on friday in washington the effects of the coronavirus in china have presented a new risk to the outlook the coronavirus has claimed more than 600 lives since its outbreak in china some economists have started to mark down their first quarter u s growth estimates as china s economy is expected to slow due to the coronavirus outbreak fed chairman jerome powell will discuss the economy and monetary policy before the house financial services committee on feb 11 and the senate banking panel the following day the monetary policy report released friday is aimed at informing the congress of the fed s outlook and sense of risks to u s and global growth a special section on financial stability was more descriptive than the previous report on possible points of stress in some areas the fed said that low interest rates had elevated asset valuations and it also pointed to risks in the corporate debt markets the concentration of investment grade debt at the lower end of the investment grade spectrum creates the risk that adverse developments such as a deterioration in economic activity could lead to a sizable volume of bond downgrades to speculative grade ratings the fed said such conditions could trigger investors to sell the downgraded bonds rapidly increasing market illiquidity and causing outsized downward price pressures the fed also mentioned that volatility in repurchase agreement markets in september highlighted the possibility for frictions in repo markets to spill over to other markets u s central bankers kept their benchmark interest rate unchanged at their meeting last month after cutting three times in 2019 forecasts released in december show that most of them expect to stay on hold through 2020 keeping the fed on the sidelines during a u s presidential election year powell told reporters on jan 29 that monetary policy is well positioned to support growth labor markets and a return of inflation to the fed s 2 target on the domestic front labor department data released earlier on friday showed the u s jobs market remains durable payrolls increased by a stronger than expected 225 000 workers and average hourly earnings climbed 3 1 from a year earlier the report also devoted a section breaking down the slowdown of manufacturing in the u s in 2019 the fed attributed the decline to a range of issues including international trade tensions weak global growth softer business investment lower oil prices affecting drillers and the slowdown in production of boeing co s 737 max airliner while the 2019 decline in manufacturing accounted directly for a 0 15 drop in gross domestic product fed economists estimated that number rises 0 5 when adding the impact on purchased inputs and downstream activities like transport and marketing a poor 2019 also comes amid a long run deterioration of manufacturing in the u s as a share of employment and gdp that goes back more than half a century and has continued this century factory output has grown just 0 5 a year since 2001 with only two of those years recording gains greater than 3 5
summary four days before the new hampshire primary seven democratic presidential candidates debated we found factual distortions on several issues former vice president joe biden said sen bernie sanders voted to give the gun manufacturers a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the crimes they have created the law generally shields gun makers from civil lawsuits resulting from the misuse of firearms or ammunition but it does include some exceptions to allow for suits sen amy klobuchar accused former south bend mayor pete buttigieg of flip flopping on support for medicare for all citing a 2018 tweet in which buttigieg said he supported it indubitably buttigieg says he supports a medicare for all who want it plan which he says would put the u s on a glide path that leads to a medicare for all environment a medicare for all environment businessman tom steyer claimed that president barack obama got iran to give up its nuclear ambitions iran agreed to a nuclear deal but its intent is unknown the agreement could delay rather than end its ambition sanders once again trotted out some of his well worn claims about health care including the false idea that the u s spends more than twice as much per capita as any other country on health care six other nations spend more than half of what the u s does sanders also claimed that there are 87 million americans who are uninsured or underinsured a statistic that includes more than 19 million people who have insurance but who had gaps in coverage the preceding year and that there are half a million people going bankrupt ecause they have cancer or heart disease or alzheimer s that tally is for filings in which medical expenses or bills contributed to the bankruptcy it does not necessarily mean medical factors were the only reason biden again claimed he voted to authorize military action against iraq in 2002 after president bush said he was not going to go into iraq in fact bush said war may be required biden boasted of coordinating the withdrawal of 156 000 u s troops from iraq during obama s first term but was silent on sending 5 000 u s troops back to fight islamic state insurgents during the second term sen elizabeth warren again pitched her 2 cent wealth tax but neglected to mention that it would be a 6 tax on net worth over 1 billion biden and sanders argued over the cost of sanders medicare for all plan but they again talked past each other the plan would cost double current federal health spending per some estimates as biden said sanders correctly cited estimates for total health spending under current law sanders said the world spends 1 8 trillion a year collectively on weapons of destruction but that figure represents the total global military expenditure not just weapons spending the feb 7 debate was hosted by abc news wmur tv in new hampshire and apple news analysis lawsuits against gun manufacturers biden said sanders voted to allow gun manufactures to not be sued for the crimes they have created the law that sanders originally supported does allow lawsuits in some cases biden the biggest mistake that sen sanders made he voted to give the gun manufacturers the only major industry in america a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the crimes they have created sanders voted in favor of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act of 2005 which largely protects licensed manufacturers dealers sellers of firearms or ammunition and trade associations from civil lawsuits over the misuse of guns or ammunition but as the congressional research service wrote in a 2012 report the legislation which president george w bush signed into law included six exceptions where civil suits could still be brought the exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law for example in november the supreme court declined to dismiss a 2015 lawsuit the families of victims of the sandy hook shooting filed against remington arms co for the way it marketed the assault style rifle adam lanza used to kill 26 people in the 2012 school shooting a connecticut judge said the case will go to trial in 2021 more than a decade after he voted for the 2005 bill sanders switched positions and signed on as a cosponsor of an unsuccessful bill that sought to repeal the law he helped enact did buttigieg flip on medicare for all klobuchar accused buttigieg of flip flopping on support for medicare for all citing a 2018 tweet in which buttigieg said he supported it indubitably and affirmatively buttigieg does not support the medicare for all plan proposed by sanders but buttigieg maintains that his plan to offer medicare as an option in the affordable care act exchanges would put the u s on a glide path that leads to a medicare for all environment klobuchar and pete while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said henceforth forthwith indubitably affirmatively you are for medicare for all for the ages and so i would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position looking at things and sticking with them buttigieg just to be clear the truth is that i have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering health care for every american here s the tweet klobuchar was referring to gosh okay i pete buttigieg politician do henceforth and forthwith declare most affirmatively and indubitably unto the ages that i do favor medicare for all as i do favor any measure that would help get all americans covered now if you ll excuse me potholes await pete buttigieg petebuttigieg february 19 2018 at the time buttigieg was the mayor of south bend and not yet a candidate for president as a candidate buttigieg has proposed a more centrist health care proposal than some democrats he does not support the medicare for all plan proposed by sanders which would expand medicare which now covers primarily those age 65 and older and some with disabilities to everyone creating a new universal single payer health care system in the united states rather buttigieg is proposing what he calls medicare for all who want it it would essentially allow people to buy into medicare through the affordable care act exchanges those who are eligible would get subsidies to pay for it and the cost would be capped at 8 5 of a person s income but it would not force people into medicare if they choose to keep the private insurance they currently have only in the last few months did it become the case that medicare for all was defined by politicians to mean ending private insurance and i ve never believed that that s the right pathway buttigieg said in an interview with the nevada independent on oct 25 i still think that we should move toward an environment of medicare for all sanders introduced a version of his medicare for all plan in his 2016 presidential campaign and it has always meant ending private insurance but there have been several public plan options proposed in congress that seek to make progress toward universal coverage buttigieg maintains that his commitment to universal health care remains and that his plan will ultimately lead to universal medicare because over time he believes people will choose it and i really do believe the public alternative will be better buttigieg said in a cnn interview on sept 19 it could well be the glide path that leads to a medicare for all environment i believe that politicians who talk about things like medicare for all should have some account of the glide path to get there buttigieg said in an interview with rachel maddow on msnbc on april 15 that s why i described how i think if we design it in the right way making a version of medicare available on the exchanges for people to buy into as an option will be the pathway to get there did iran give up its nuclear ambitions steyer claimed that obama got iran to give up its nuclear ambitions this is a matter of dispute iran s intent is unknown but the iran nuclear agreement could also be viewed as curbing or delaying the country s ambition not ending it the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa was implemented in 2016 its aim was to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon it attempts to do this by requiring iran to reduce the number of operating centrifuges and its stockpile of uranium while allowing international atomic energy agency inspectors to monitor iran s declared nuclear facilities in exchange iran won relief from international sanctions and the ability to continue to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes however the deal contained sunset provisions which lift physical restrictions on iran s nuclear activities over a period of 10 15 years as explained in a 67 page guidebook published by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university if fully implemented the physical constraints and verification provisions of this comprehensive nuclear agreement will effectively prevent iran from producing fissile material for nuclear weapons at its declared nuclear facilities for at least 10 to 15 years the belfer guide to the iran deal says the nonpartisan arms control association said something similar in its august 2015 analysis of the agreement no single element blocks iran s pathway to nuclear weapons but taken together the nuclear restrictions and monitoring form a comprehensive system that will put nuclear weapons out of iran s reach for at least 15 years the arms control association analysis said under trump the u s has withdrawn from the nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on iran the president and other republicans have criticized the deal for allowing iran to continue to enrich uranium and giving it access to billions of dollars in frozen assets in another report on the nuclear deal the belfer center summed up the arguments for and against the iran deal those who believe the deal does not prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons say the nuclear agreement does not represent a strategic shift away from nuclear weapons only a tactical decision to postpone those ambitions in order to get relief from international sanctions the report said in announcing the deal in august 2015 obama described it as a detailed arrangement that permanently prohibits iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon but even obama has acknowledged that the deal may not end iran s nuclear ambitions but delay it essentially we re purchasing for 13 14 15 years assurances that the breakout is at least a year obama told npr in august 2015 and then in years 13 and 14 it is possible that those breakout times would have been much shorter but at that point we have much better ideas about what it is that their program involves sanders health care claims sanders repeated several of his go to lines about health care that don t entirely reflect the facts first citing high health care costs the vermont senator said we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country he has made some version of this claim since at least 2015 including in a cnn town hall last year and the september and january democratic debates it s still not true according to the most recent organization for economic cooperation and development data which is for 2018 u s per capita spending on health care totaled 10 586 that s twice as much as every country except for six sanders is correct that the u s spends a lot more than other nations it spends more than double the 3 992 average for oecd countries but switzerland norway germany sweden austria and denmark all pay a little more than half of what the u s does later in the debate sanders said there were 87 million people uninsured or underinsured and 500 000 people going bankrupt for what reason because they have cancer or heart disease or alzheimer s as we have explained before the 87 million uninsured or underinsured number comes from a commonwealth fund survey which generally backs the figure but the tally includes 19 3 million people who were insured but had experienced a gap in coverage in the prior year sanders also didn t give the whole story behind the 500 000 people going bankrupt figure something he has done before he presented those bankruptcies as entirely due to health problems and medical bills but the number stems from a survey that counted the number of bankruptcies in which medical expenses or medical problems either somewhat or very much contributed the survey which was published as an editorial article in the american journal of public health found that 66 5 of the participants who declared bankruptcy between 2013 and 2016 cited medical reasons as a contributor the half a million estimate is derived by applying that percentage to the 750 489 non business bankruptcies filed in 2019 biden on war authorization biden repeated his standard and inaccurate defense of his 2002 vote to authorize military action against saddam hussein s iraq biden i trusted george bush to keep his word he said he was not going to go into iraq but president george w bush made no such promise to the contrary bush said publicly in a speech on oct 7 2002 that war was a possibility i hope this will not require military action but it may and military conflict could be difficult that was just a few days before the senate voted 77 23 in favor of the resolution with biden then chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in the majority furthermore biden opposed a move by other democrats to require that bush either win united nations approval of military action or return to congress for a second authorization biden said on the senate floor that it would strengthen the president s hand in pressing the u n for more aggressive inspections of possible weapons of mass destruction if the president could say i am already authorized if you fail to do that to use force against saddam hussein we addressed this biden claim at greater length in our jan 15 story factchecking the january democratic debate biden on bringing troops home biden also spun his role in bringing troops home from iraq when he was vice president biden the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said joe i want you to organize getting 156 000 troops out of iraq i did that i did that it s true that in 2009 biden chaired a committee that oversaw the troop withdrawal while also keeping an eye on economic and political issues in iraq the biden committee included representatives from the defense department the joint chiefs of staff the treasury department and other agencies but what biden fails to mention is that later in obama s second term with biden still vice president the u s sent troops back into iraq to combat the islamic state fighters who had occupied much of the country near the end of the obama administration in late september 2016 the number of u s troops deployed exceeded 5 000 warren s wealth tax warren referenced her proposed wealth tax twice during the debate both times calling it a 2 cent wealth tax it s true that part of her plan includes an annual tax of 2 cents on every dollar of wealth over 50 million but she didn t mention that her amended plan would call on those with more than 1 billion of wealth to pay triple that amount warren s original plan included the 2 tax on net worth over 50 million and a 3 tax on net worth over 1 billion but she later introduced a plan to pay for medicare for all that included increasing the higher threshold tax to 6 warren aims to spend the money raised by those taxes largely on improving education as we detailed in june she says her plan would cover universal child care for every child age 0 to 5 universal pre k for every 3 and 4 year old higher wages for child care workers and preschool teachers tuition and fees for all public technical schools 2 year colleges and 4 year colleges 50 billion for historically black colleges and universities and forgiveness of student loan debt for 95 of those with such debt it would also provide 100 billion over 10 years to combat the opioid crisis and make down payments on a green new deal and medicare for all however some economists have questioned whether her plan would raise as much as she expects as we ve written before the penn wharton budget model projected that if implemented in 2021 the taxes would raise between 2 3 trillion and 2 7 trillion over 10 years that s about 1 trillion to 1 4 trillion less than the warren campaign s estimate pwbm also estimated that the wealth tax would reduce gross domestic product in 2050 by about 1 2 depending on how the money is spent the wealth tax though is a frequent talking point for warren who mentioned it on the debate stage during a discussion of racism in america and highlighted it in her closing remarks saying warren everyone says they love the kids but here s the deal it s time to come up with real plans to make that happen i ve talked before about a 2 cent wealth tax but the whole idea behind it is we could do early childhood education and good quality child care universal pre k for every 3 year old and 4 year old in america and we can stop exploiting the people largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in america maybe so but it would cost those with more than 1 billion in net worth 6 of their wealth over that amount not 2 medicare for all by the numbers biden and sanders argued over the cost of sanders medicare for all plan biden criticized sanders for not providing a price tag for his plan and said it would cost double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the united states sanders said what biden wanted the status quo would cost 50 trillion over the next 10 years both have a point we ll go through the numbers sanders hasn t provided a price tag for his plan and many of the details would need to be ironed out before a solid estimate could be calculated several organizations have come up with varying estimates in an estimate published online by sanders 2016 presidential campaign gerald friedman a professor of economics at the university of massachusetts amherst said the plan would increase government spending by 13 8 trillion over 10 years but that s the low end of the estimates others have ranged from 25 trillion to 34 trillion over 10 years that s more than double what the federal government now spends on health care programs total federal health care spending was 1 trillion in 2018 according to the centers for medicare medicaid services and a projected 14 trillion over 10 years 2018 2027 see table 16 under projections that would put the cost at double current federal health care spending sanders meanwhile cited the projection from cms for total national health care expenditures which includes all government employer individual and insurer spending that totals a projected 47 trillion over 10 years nearly 50 trillion what biden ignores is that federal health spending would be nearly all health spending under medicare for all so payments by insurers individuals employers and even state and local governments would shift to the federal government what sanders ignores is that some estimates on the cost of his plan expect total national health spending to increase from the status quo a recent estimate by the urban institute found a single payer plan like sanders would increase national health spending by 720 billion in 2020 there s still guesswork involved without more concrete details on the plan such as what rates it would pay health care providers a february 2019 analysis by the committee for a responsible federal budget said that total national health spending would likely change by no more than a few trillion dollars over the decade and whether that change was up or down would depend on the whether the increased cost of expanding coverage by making health insurance more generous and offering it to more people is larger or smaller than the amount saved from lower provider payments drug payments and administrative spending sanders on global weapons spending in discussing his hope to galvanize international support to collectively combat climate change sanders inaccurately characterized a statistic on global military spending here is my dream maybe it s a radical dream sanders said but maybe just maybe given the crisis of climate change the world can understand that instead of spending 1 8 trillion a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change that 1 8 trillion represents spending on more than just weapons the figure is the 2018 total world military expenditure as calculated by the stockholm international peace research institute a think tank that researches conflict armaments and more military expenditure refers to all government spending on current military forces and activities including salaries and benefits operational expenses arms and equipment purchases military construction research and development and central administration command and support the organization says of the figure sipri therefore discourages the use of terms such as arms spending when referring to

while papua new guinea s economic growth rebounded in 2019 global and domestic economic uncertainties loom affecting economic prospects real gdp growth recovered to 5 6 percent in 2019 from 0 8 percent in 2018 driven by a rebound in the resource sector mainly in its extractive segment earlier affected by an earthquake masking slower growth of the non resource economy the slowdown in the non resource activity was due to sluggish domestic demand as confirmed by a shortfall in non resource tax revenue and lower inflation while formal employment improved during the first nine months of 2019 the growth outlook remains positive but projected gdp growth rates are lower than our previous forecasts mainly due to delays in finalizing agreements and launching implementation of large new resource projects the other major factor that impacted the downgrade in the growth outlook include heightened global uncertainty due to i a partial nature of the recent trade deal between the united states and china and ii a fresh emergence of new risks to chinese and global growth including a novel coronavirus a growing oversupply in the global liquefied natural gas market may also influence revenues in the extractive sector with some negative implications for the non resource economy as a result real gdp growth is projected to hover around 3 percent on average in 2020 22 with downside risks including unexpected external shocks or potential domestic political and economic turbulence prevailing the authorities have responded to the adverse economic environment through expansionary macroeconomic policy which could complicate macro fiscal sustainability the government introduced a fiscal stimulus program in 2020 aimed at supporting domestic demand by investing in physical infrastructure for better connectivity by roads ports and telecommunications the government will also continue addressing budget arrears accumulated by the previous administration these policies will lead to higher budget financing needs to be covered from domestic and external sources external borrowing should help to address a legacy of outstanding and incoming orders for foreign currency a so called fx backlog while limiting a required adjustment in the exchange rate however in the absence of fiscal buffers since the sovereign wealth fund remains nonoperational the anticipated fiscal expansion and increased net borrowing may undermine fiscal and debt sustainability keeping the kina overvalued may maintain or increase the fx backlog or lead to a drawdown of international reserves to improve macro fiscal sustainability it is important that the authorities resume fiscal consolidation and begin addressing the overvaluation of the kina more decisively the authorities are emphasizing the development of physical and human capital to improve the quality and inclusiveness of economic growth a recent referendum in the autonomous region of bougainville where the overwhelming majority of the population voted for independence underscores the need to improve the inclusiveness of economic development the government recognizes that economic growth requires investments in not only infrastructure connectivity and physical capital but also in human capital human capital are the health knowledge skills and resilience people accumulate over time the government s commitment to becoming an early adopter of the world bank s human capital project is an important milestone toward better and more efficient investment in the human capital of papua new guinea special focus human capital development as a prerequisite to inclusive growth a child born in papua new guinea will be only 38 percent as productive when she grows up as she could be if she enjoyed a complete education and full health based on the human capital index hci score papua new guinea s hci of 0 38 is below the regional average for east asia and the pacific 0 61 and is comparable to the regional average of sub saharan africa 0 40 the quality of a country s human capital stock is determined by the health knowledge and skills of its population papua new guinea has made only modest progress in improving key health outcomes and has the fourth highest rate of stunting in the world with respect to knowledge and skills development the country faces an acute learning crisis the results of the early grade reading assessment implemented in ten of the country s 22 provinces indicate that students literacy skills did not meet the requirements of the png grade 1 standards based curriculum students in papua new guinea also performed worse than their peers in the pacific region on the pacific islands numeracy and literacy assessment in 2018 many papua new guineans that do graduate from school fail to achieve satisfactory standards due to the poor quality of education that they are offered as a consequence png s labor force is primarily low skilled with the majority of papua new guineans not educated beyond grade 10 the economy suffers from skills gaps and from mismatches between the demand and supply of skilled labor the majority of working age papua new guineans the youth especially are employed in the informal sector moreover there is a gender gap in access to work in the formal sector with twice as many men as women employed in the formal sector png continues to face macroeconomic challenges to scaling up public spending on human development yet public spending on health and education are among the lowest in the world relative to png s per capita income and relative to comparator countries with deleterious effects on service delivery and outcomes png s performance on the hci and the challenges described in our analysis point to seven areas where critical action is needed to accelerate progress on human development fostering strong leadership and mobilizing a multi sectoral response financing the human capital agenda accelerating the demographic transition combatting stunting bolstering the frontlines of health service delivery arresting the crisis in learning taking urgent action to address skill gaps the future growth and productivity of png will be determined by the investments the country makes in its children papua new guineans born today will usher in the 22nd century and deal with new opportunities brought about by technology and globalization as well as new challenges wrought by climate change good health knowledge skills and resilience will be vital for facing up to these opportunities and challenges the government of png has in place a solid foundation in terms of policies and initiatives to strengthen human capital going forward the goal is to ensure that these policies are implemented effectively and adequately resourced this will make it possible for png and all papua new guineans to achieve their full potential

sri lanka s economy bouncing back from easter attacks imf courtesy ada derana the economy of sri lanka is recovering from tragic terrorist attacks on easter sunday last year says the international monetary fund imf the gross domestic project gdp growth is projected to rebound to 3 7 percent in 2020 on the back of the recovery in tourism and assuming that the novel coronavirus will have only limited negative effect on tourism arrivals and other economic activities the washington based organization said further the imf stated this in a statement released following the end of its staff visit to sri lanka a staff team from the imf led by manuela goretti visited colombo during january 29 february 7 2020 to meet with the new administration and discuss its policy agenda at the conclusion of the staff visit ms goretti issued the following statement the imf staff team had constructive discussions with the sri lankan authorities on recent economic developments and the country s economic reform agenda given the high level of public debt and refinancing needs in the country ensuring macroeconomic stability calls for fiscal consolidation prudent monetary policy and sustained efforts to build international reserves ambitious structural and institutional reforms remain critical to raise the country s growth potential and promote inclusiveness the economy is gradually recovering from the terrorist attacks last april real gdp growth is estimated at 2 6 percent in 2019 the recovery is supported by a solid performance of the manufacturing sector and a rebound in tourism and related services in the second half of the year high frequency indicators continue to improve and growth is projected to rebound to 3 7 percent in 2020 on the back of the recovery in tourism and assuming that the novel coronavirus will have only limited negative effect on tourism arrivals and other economic activities inflation is projected to remain at around 4ยฝ percent in line with the central bank of sri lanka cbsl target after a sharp import contraction in 2019 the current account deficit is expected to widen to nearly 3 percent of gdp in 2020 preliminary data indicate that the primary surplus target under the program supported by the extended fund facility eff was missed by a sizable margin in 2019 with a recorded deficit of 0 3 percent of gdp due to weak revenue performance and expenditure overruns under current policies as discussed with the authorities during the visit the primary deficit could widen further to 1 9 percent of gdp in 2020 due to newly implemented tax cuts and exemptions clearance of domestic arrears and backloaded capital spending from 2019 given risks to debt sustainability and large refinancing needs over the medium term renewed efforts to advance fiscal consolidation will be essential for macroeconomic stability measures to improve efficiency in the public administration and strengthen revenue mobilization can help reduce the high public debt while preserving space for critical social and investment needs advancing relevant legislation to strengthen fiscal rules would anchor policy commitments restore confidence and safeguard sustainability over the medium term the cbsl should continue to follow a prudent and data dependent monetary policy and stand ready to adjust rates to evolving macroeconomic conditions net international reserves fell short of the end december target under the eff supported program in 2019 by about 100 million amid market pressures after the presidential elections and announced tax cuts however conditions have since stabilized renewed efforts are needed to rebuild reserve buffers to safeguard resilience to shocks under a flexible exchange rate approval of the new central bank law in line with international best practices is a critical step to further strengthen the independence and governance of the cbsl and support the adoption of flexible inflation targeting the financial system remains broadly stable although some pockets of vulnerability remain especially among non bank financial institutions caps on lending rates and the loan repayment moratorium for small and medium enterprises should be temporary to avoid unintended distortions and inefficiencies in financial intermediation modernizing the banking act with a view to strengthening and harmonizing regulation supervision and resolution frameworks for deposit taking financial institutions would help safeguard financial stability the authorities should move ahead with growth enhancing structural reforms to fully harness sri lanka s economic potential and foster greater social inclusion the team welcomed the authorities plans to enhance the efficiency of state owned enterprises enabling them to operate on a sound commercial basis these plans would need to be supported by a visible commitment to strengthen governance and transparency notably in the energy sector and renewed efforts to tackle corruption concerted initiatives are needed to foster the business climate promote trade openness and investment and strengthen infrastructure sustainably including to respond to the challenges from climate change sri lanka stands to gain from greater female labor participation enhancements in social protection and further investment in education and skills the team met with the secretary to

commentary argentina is a rich country that has made itself systematically poorer for a century not due to war or natural disaster but by generations of failed leadership it s argentina week at the vatican while argentinians still ask about when pope francis will make his first visit home there is no doubt that he is paying close attention to the latest economic disaster to hit his country on jan 31 argentina s newly elected president alberto fernรกndez made his first visit to pope francis that meeting produced a minor embarrassment when the holy see press office released a statement that the pope and president had discussed abortion the president promptly said that they didn t the holy see conceded that their original press statement was not accurate this week the pontifical academy of social sciences led by argentinian bishop marcelo sรกnchez sorondo hosted a seminar on international economics entitled new forms of solidarity towards fraternal inclusion integration and innovation the holy father addressed the seminar himself and participants included the head of the international monetary fund imf kristalina georgieva and argentina s new finance minister martรญn guzmรกn argentina on the brink those two held their first bilateral meeting while in rome as argentina needs to restructure 100 billion in sovereign debt in 2018 it required a 57 billion bailout from the imf just to stay ahead of its creditors argentina is in a steep recession the economy is expected to shrink for the third straight year and inflation is running at more than 50 the kind of austerity measures usually required to pay back such high levels of debt are not feasible in argentina either argentina secures some sort of debt relief or forgiveness or it will default argentina is the great delinquent of sovereign finance needing some 30 relief packages from the imf over the years the 2018 bailout was the largest ever in imf history not that the bailouts have helped much argentina has defaulted on its sovereign debt an astonishing eight times including the mammoth 100 billion default in 2001 it is to be expected that the first argentinian pope would give special attention to argentina given that cardinal jorge bergoglio had traveled minimally before his election as pope he had never been to the united states for example it is the argentinian economic experience that led him to his popular diagnosis that this economy kills a century of decline it is important to understand how unique argentina is in the global economy it is a rich country that has made itself systematically poorer for a century not due to war or natural disaster but by generations of failed leadership there is a disputed quotation attributed to the peruvian novelist and nobel laureate mario vargas llosa there are countries that are rich and countries that are poor and there are poor countries that are growing rich and then there is argentina there are no other countries like argentina in 2014 the economist ran a feature on argentina a century of decline the figures are startling in the 43 years leading up to 1914 gdp had grown at an annual rate of 6 the fastest recorded in the world the country was a magnet for european immigrants who flocked to find work on the fertile pampas where crops and cattle were propelling argentina s expansion in 1914 half of buenos aires s population was foreign born the country ranked among the ten richest in the world after the likes of australia britain and the united states but ahead of france germany and italy its income per head was 92 of the average of 16 rich economies from this vantage point it looked down its nose at its neighbors brazil s population was less than a quarter as well off it never got better than this although argentina has had periods of robust growth in the past century not least during the commodity boom of the past ten years and its people remain wealthier than most latin americans its standing as one of the world s most vibrant economies is a distant memory its income per head is now 43 of those same 16 rich economies it trails chile and uruguay in its own back yard and it has gotten worse since 2014 in 1929 when pope francis parents emigrated from italy to argentina it was roughly as wealthy as canada which is why it attracted so many immigrants jorge bergoglio would grow up to become a bishop of the slums admired for his pastoral closeness to the slum dwellers had the bergoglios emigrated to canada cardinal bergoglio could not have become a bishop of the slums toronto for example does not have the slums that buenos aires does and argentina didn t once upon a time an argentinian view of the global economy pope francis delivered a very pointed address to the vatican economic seminar calling for the world s top 50 richest individuals to eliminate child starvation globally he inveighed against tax shelters and unpaid taxes which he argued denied the poor the government services and economic assistance they need and without specific reference to argentina he addressed the problem of indebtedness his emphasis was not on the bad governance that produced the latest debt crisis but on the need for debt forgiveness now poor people in heavily indebted countries bear overwhelming tax burdens and cuts in social services as their governments pay debts contracted insensitively and unsustainably pope francis said can become a factor that damages the social fabric the view from argentina might explain the economic assessment of global conditions in the holy father s speech pope francis claimed that the poor increase around us and that the poor are always poorer and today they are poorer than ever global economic data suggest that extreme poverty has been falling rapidly and that it is at its lowest level ever less than 10 of the world population indeed the millennium development goals on poverty reduction set in 2000 aimed to cut extreme poverty levels in half from 1990 levels by the year 2015 it met the target in 2013 the millennium development goals are the most successful global anti poverty push in history states the united nations on its mdg website governments international organizations and civil society groups around the world have helped to cut in half the world s extreme poverty rate more girls are in school fewer children are dying poverty is not eradicated of course reducing extreme poverty still leaves plenty of actual poverty inequality is a related phenomenon but not exactly the same nevertheless there is actually plenty of good news since the millennium on the global development front but not in argentina there was a severe crisis in 2000 there is another severe crisis now but the whole world is not argentina even during argentina week at the vatican father raymond j de souza is the editor in chief of convivium magazine
president donald trump s trade war is projected to reduce the average family s real income by 1 277 according to a new report from the congressional budget office cbo the cbo a nonpartisan congressional research arm projected that the tariffs imposed by the trump administration and retaliatory tariffs imposed by countries like china will reduce economic growth while increasing prices to consumers tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real gdp by roughly 0 5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0 5 percent in 2020 as a result tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by 1 277 in 2019 dollars in 2020 the report said the figure is more than double the 580 projection in last year s cbo report by comparison the median american household pays about 2 000 in federal income taxes meaning the trade war effectively amounts to a tax hike of more than 60 the report said the negative effects will diminish over time as companies adjust to market conditions but still projects the trade war to lower economic growth every year through 2030 if the tariffs stay in place the cbo explained that tariffs hurt the us economy in multiple ways contradicting trump s claim that trade wars are good and easy to win for one tariffs increase costs on consumer goods they also create uncertainty that leads some u s businesses to delay or forgo new investments or make costly adjustments to their supply chains and tariffs also result in retaliatory policies from trading partners reducing exports by american companies the report also added that the tariffs directly affect deficits and debt the report projected the federal budget deficit to increase to 1 trillion this year and will average 1 3 trillion per year through 2030 the federal debt is projected to grow from 81 of the gdp in 2020 to 98 of the gdp in 2030 and 180 of the gdp in 2050 and despite trump s claim that his policies have led to historic economic growth the cbo projects that the economy will grow by just 1 7 through 2030 trump had claimed that the economy would grow by 4 to 6 but growth has been barely over 2 in each of the last three quarters slower than during the final three years of the obama administration the cbo report is just the latest research showing the consequences to consumers from trump s trade war a 2019 new york federal reserve report showed that the costs of the tariffs were passed on entirely to consumers in the form of higher prices with no impact on foreign exporters a report by economists on the federal reserve board published in december further showed that the tariffs hurt the manufacturing industry that they were intended to protect the report found that the tariffs gave manufacturers a small boost but it was soon offset by larger drags from the effects of rising costs and retaliatory tariffs as a result manufacturing employment fell while prices to consumers continued to increase causing a recession in the manufacturing sector for much of last year the trade war has also hit the retail technology telecommunications and apparel industries many of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by china and other countries in response to trump s escalation also targeted farmers trump responded by announcing two farmer bailouts that were double the size of the 2009 auto bailout under former president barack obama the revenues raised by the tariffs imposed on china are nowhere near enough to cover the cost of the bailouts according to another report from the federal reserve bank of new york despite trump s attempt to throw taxpayer money at a problem of his own creation farm bankruptcies skyrocketed by 20 last year the biggest increase since the period following the 2007 08 economic crisis trump has argued that the pain of the trade wars is worth it because it creates negotiation leverage in trade talks with countries like china trump bragged about two historic victories after he signed a phase 1 deal with china and the us mexico canada agreement usmca trump s highly touted replacement for nafta the usmca is 90 percent identical to nafta noted the washington post s catherine rampell which trump called the worst trade deal ever made much of the rest largely cribs language from the trans pacific partnership an obama era deal trump tore up because it was a disaster and a rape of our country in trump s words the deal does include some protectionist elements for sectors like the us auto industry but the administration s own analysis found that these provisions may actually hurt auto companies by raising costs the phase 1 china deal rolled back some though not nearly all of the tariffs on china in exchange for chinese officials pledging to massively increase us agricultural imports but some farmer groups quickly criticized trump for making a deal based on a promise of one time purchase rather than long term relief president trump said that we re all going to need to go buy bigger tractors north dakota farmer justin sherlock told reuters i don t think many farmers are going to invest much money until we see that this is a done deal and a long term deal chinese officials have already suggested they won t make the purchases if market conditions change according to the post and soybean prices fell despite trump touting china s nonbinding promise to buy billions of dollars of soybeans estimates reported by bloomberg news suggest that the cost of the tariffs to consumers may wipe out what little benefit families got from the trump tax cuts which overwhelmingly flowed to the rich and to corporations gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics predicted to the outlet that the annual cost to households could continue to increase despite trump s highly touted new trade deals for the average household it will be a net loss no doubt he said it will be painful

from celgene among other items deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates this earnings release also provides international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange non gaap information is intended to portray the results of the company s baseline performance supplement or enhance management analysts and investors overall understanding of the company s underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current past and future periods for example non gaap earnings and eps information is an indication of the company s baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of the company s ongoing results in addition this information is among the primary indicators that we use as a basis for evaluating performance allocating resources setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted eps prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure amortization of acquired intangible assets were previously included in non gaap earnings and eps information these amounts have become significant to the financial results subsequent to the celgene acquisition and as a result have been excluded in the non gaap results to better reflect our core operating performance comparable prior period non gaap results have not been revised to include this adjustment as the related amounts were insignificant 97 million in 2018 in connection with presenting our outlook we are also providing non gaap eps guidance for 2021 there is no reliable or reasonably estimable comparable gaap measure for this because we are not able to reliably predict the impact of specified items beyond the next twelve months as a result the reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measure is not available without unreasonable effort in addition the company believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors the variability of the specified items may have a significant and unpredictable impact on our future gaap results website information we routinely post important information for investors on our website bms com in the investors section we may use

in 2007 i was at a conference where paul mcculley who was with pimco at the time was discussing the idea of a minsky moment at that time this idea fell on deaf ears as the markets and economy were in full swing however it wasn t too long before the 2008 financial crisis brought the minsky moment thesis to the forefront what was revealed of course was the dangers of profligacy which resulted in the triggering of a wave of margin calls a massive selloff in assets to cover debts and higher default rates so what exactly is a minsky moment economist hyman minsky argued that the economic cycle is driven more by surges in the banking system and in the supply of credit than by the relationship which is traditionally thought more important between companies and workers in the labor market in other words during periods of bullish speculation if they last long enough the excesses generated by reckless speculative activity will eventually lead to a crisis of course the longer the speculation occurs the more severe the crisis will be hyman minsky argued there is an inherent instability in financial markets he postulated that an abnormally long bullish economic growth cycle would spur an asymmetric rise in market speculation which would eventually result in market instability and collapse a minsky moment crisis follows a prolonged period of bullish speculation which is also associated with high amounts of debt taken on by both retail and institutional investors one way to look at leverage as it relates to the financial markets is through margin debt and in particular the level of free cash investors have to deploy in periods of high speculation investors are likely to be levered borrow money to invest which leaves them with negative cash balances while margin balances did decline in 2018 as the markets fell due to the federal reserve hiking rates and reducing their balance sheet it is notable that current levels of leverage are still excessively higher than they were either in 1999 or 2007 this is also seen by looking at the s p 500 versus the growth rate of margin debt the mainstream analysis dismisses margin debt under the assumption that it is the reflection of bullish attitudes in the market leverage fuels the market rise in the early stages of an advance this is correct however in the later stages of an advance when bullish optimism and speculative behaviors are at the peaks leverage has a dark side to it as i discussed previously at some point a reversion process will take hold it is when investor psychology collides with leverage and the problems associated with market liquidity it will be the equivalent of striking a match lighting a stick of dynamite and throwing it into a tanker full of gasoline that moment is the minsky moment as noted these reversion of bullish excess are not a new thing in the book the cost of capitalism robert barbera s discussed previous periods in history the last five major global cyclical events were the early 1990s recession largely occasioned by the u s savings loan crisis the collapse of japan inc after the stock market crash of 1990 the asian crisis of the mid 1990s the fabulous technology boom bust cycle at the turn of the millennium and the unprecedented rise and then collapse for u s residential real estate in 2007 2008 all five episodes delivered recessions either global or regional in no case was there as significant prior acceleration of wages and general prices in each case an investment boom and an associated asset market ran to improbably heights and then collapsed from 1945 to 1985 there was no recession caused by the instability of investment prompted by financial speculation and since 1985 there has been no recession that has not been caused by these factors read that last sentence again interestingly it was post 1970 the federal reserve became active in trying to control interest rates and inflation through monetary policy as noted in the fed the stability instability paradox in the u s the federal reserve has been the catalyst behind every preceding financial event since they became active monetarily policy wise in the late 70s as shown in the chart below when the fed has lifted the short term lending rates to a level higher than the 2 year rate bad stuff has historically followed the fed is doing it again as noted above minsky moment crises occur because investors engaging in excessively aggressive speculation take on additional credit risk during prosperous times or bull markets the longer a bull market lasts the more investors borrow to try and capitalize on market moves however it hasn t just been investors tapping into debt to capitalize on the bull market advance but corporations have gorged on debt for unproductive spending dividend issuance and share buybacks as i noted in last week s macroview since the economy is driven by consumption and theoretically companies should be taking on debt for productive purposes to meet rising demand analyzing corporate debt relative to underlying economic growth gives us a view on leverage levels the problem with debt of course is it is leverage that has to be serviced by underlying cash flows of the business while asset prices have surged to historic highs corporate profits for the entirety of u s business have remained flat since 2014 such doesn t suggest the addition of leverage is being done to grow profits but rather to sustain them over the last decade the federal reserve s ongoing liquidity interventions zero interest rates and maintaining extremely accommodative policies has led to substantial increases in speculative investment such was driven by the belief that if something breaks the fed will be there to fix to it despite a decade long economic expansion record stock market prices and record low unemployment the fed continues to support financial speculation through ongoing interventions john authers recently penned an excellent piece on this issue for bloomberg why does liquidity look quite so bullish as ever we can thank central banks and particularly the federal reserve twelve months ago the u s central bank intended to restrict liquidity steadily by shrinking the assets on its balance sheet on auto pilot that changed though it reversed course and then cut rates three times and most importantly it started to build its balance sheet again in an attempt to shore up the repo market which banks use to access short term finance when it suddenly froze up in september in terms of the increase in u s liquidity over 12 months by crossborder s measures this was the biggest liquidity boost ever while john believes we are early in the global liquidity cycle i personally am not so sure given the magnitude of the increase central bank balance sheets over the last decade currently global central bank balance sheets have grown from roughly 5 trillion in 2007 to 21 trillion currently in other words central bank balance sheets are equivalent to the size of the entire u s economy in 2007 the global stock market capitalization was 65 trillion in 2019 the global stock market capitalization hit 85 trillion which was an increase of 20 trillion or roughly equivalent to the expansion of the central bank balance sheets in the u s there has been a clear correlation between the fed s balance sheet expansions and speculative risk taking in the financial markets is another minsky moment looming the international monetary fund imf has been issuing global warnings of high debt levels and slowing global economic growth which has the potential to result in minsky moment crises around the globe while this has not come to fruition yet the warning signs are there globally there is roughly 15 trillion in negative yielding debt with asset prices fundamentally detached for corporate profitability and excessive valuations on multiple levels as desmond lachman wrote how else can one explain that the risky u s leveraged loan market has increased to more than 1 3 trillion and that the size of today s global leveraged loan market is some two and a half times the size of the u s subprime market in 2008 or how else can one explain that in 2017 argentina was able to place a 100 year bond or that european high yield borrowers can place their debt at negative interest rates or that as dysfunctional and heavily indebted government as that of italy can borrow at a lower interest rate than that of the united states or that the government of greece can borrow at negative interest rates these are all clear indications that speculative excess is present in the markets currently however there is one other prime ingredient needed to complete the environment for a minsky moment to occur that ingredient is complacency yet despite the clearest signs that global credit has been grossly misallocated and that global credit risk has been seriously mispriced both markets and policymakers seem to be remarkably sanguine it would seem that the furthest thing from their minds is that once again we could experience a minsky moment involving a violent repricing of risky assets that could cause real strains in the financial markets desmond is correct currently despite record asset prices leverage debt combined with slowing economic growth the level of complacency is extraordinarily high given that no one currently believes another credit related crisis can occur is what is needed to allow one to happen professor minsky taught that markets have short memories and that they repeatedly delude themselves into believing that this time will be different sadly judging by today s market exuberance in the face of mounting economic and political risks once again minsky is likely to be proved correct at this point in the cycle the next minsky moment is inevitable all that is missing is the catalyst to start the ball rolling an unexpected recession would more than likely due to trick original post editor s

the cbo a nonpartisan congressional research arm projected that the tariffs imposed by the trump administration and retaliatory tariffs imposed by countries like china will reduce economic growth while increasing prices to consumers tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real gdp by roughly 0 5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0 5 percent in 2020 as a result tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by 1 277 in 2019 dollars in 2020 the report said the figure is more than double the 580 projection in last year s cbo report by comparison the median american household pays about 2 000 in federal income taxes meaning the trade war effectively amounts to a tax hike of more than 60 the report said the negative effects will diminish over time as companies adjust to market conditions but still projects the trade war to lower economic growth every year through 2030 if the tariffs stay in place the cbo explained that tariffs hurt the us economy in multiple ways contradicting trump s claim that trade wars are good and easy to win for one tariffs increase costs on consumer goods they also create uncertainty that leads some u s businesses to delay or forgo new investments or make costly adjustments to their supply chains and tariffs also result in retaliatory policies from trading partners reducing exports by american companies the report also added that the tariffs directly affect deficits and debt the report projected the federal budget deficit to increase to 1 trillion this year and will average 1 3 trillion per year through 2030 the federal debt is projected to grow from 81 of the gdp in 2020 to 98 of the gdp in 2030 and 180 of the gdp in 2050 and despite trump s claim that his policies have led to historic economic growth the cbo projects that the economy will grow by just 1 7 through 2030 trump had claimed that the economy would grow by 4 to 6 but growth has been barely over 2 in each of the last three quarters slower than during the final three years of the obama administration the cbo report is just the latest research showing the consequences to consumers from trump s trade war a 2019 new york federal reserve report showed that the costs of the tariffs were passed on entirely to consumers in the form of higher prices with no impact on foreign exporters a report by economists on the federal reserve board published in december further showed that the tariffs hurt the manufacturing industry that they were intended to protect the report found that the tariffs gave manufacturers a small boost but it was soon offset by larger drags from the effects of rising costs and retaliatory tariffs as a result manufacturing employment fell while prices to consumers continued to increase causing a recession in the manufacturing sector for much of last year the trade war has also hit the retail technology telecommunications and apparel industries many of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by china and other countries in response to trump s escalation also targeted farmers trump responded by announcing two farmer bailouts that were double the size of the 2009 auto bailout under former president barack obama the revenues raised by the tariffs imposed on china are nowhere near enough to cover the cost of the bailouts according to another report from the federal reserve bank of new york despite trump s attempt to throw taxpayer money at a problem of his own creation farm bankruptcies skyrocketed by 20 last year the biggest increase since the period following the 2007 08 economic crisis trump has argued that the pain of the trade wars is worth it because it creates negotiation leverage in trade talks with countries like china trump bragged about two historic victories after he signed a phase 1 deal with china and the us mexico canada agreement usmca trump s highly touted replacement for nafta the usmca is 90 percent identical to nafta noted the washington post s catherine rampell which trump called the worst trade deal ever made much of the rest largely cribs language from the trans pacific partnership an obama era deal trump tore up because it was a disaster and a rape of our country in trump s words the deal does include some protectionist elements for sectors like the us auto industry but the administration s own analysis found that these provisions may actually hurt auto companies by raising costs the phase 1 china deal rolled back some though not nearly all of the tariffs on china in exchange for chinese officials pledging to massively increase us agricultural imports but some farmer groups quickly criticized trump for making a deal based on a promise of one time purchase rather than long term relief president trump said that we re all going to need to go buy bigger tractors north dakota farmer justin sherlock told reuters i don t think many farmers are going to invest much money until we see that this is a done deal and a long term deal chinese officials have already suggested they won t make the purchases if market conditions change according to the post and soybean prices fell despite trump touting china s nonbinding promise to buy billions of dollars of soybeans estimates reported by bloomberg news suggest that the cost of the tariffs to consumers may wipe out what little benefit families got from the trump tax cuts which overwhelmingly flowed to the rich and to corporations gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics predicted to the outlet that the annual cost to households

president donald trump s trade war is projected to reduce the average family s real income by 1 277 according to a new report from the congressional budget office cbo the cbo a nonpartisan congressional research arm projected that the tariffs imposed by the trump administration and retaliatory tariffs imposed by countries like china will reduce economic growth while increasing prices to consumers tariffs are expected to reduce the level of real gdp by roughly 0 5 percent and raise consumer prices by 0 5 percent in 2020 as a result tariffs are also projected to reduce average real household income by 1 277 in 2019 dollars in 2020 the report said the figure is more than double the 580 projection in last year s cbo report by comparison the median american household pays about 2 000 in federal income taxes meaning the trade war effectively amounts to a tax hike of more than 60 the report said the negative effects will diminish over time as companies adjust to market conditions but still projects the trade war to lower economic growth every year through 2030 if the tariffs stay in place the cbo explained that tariffs hurt the us economy in multiple ways contradicting trump s claim that trade wars are good and easy to win for one tariffs increase costs on consumer goods they also create uncertainty that leads some u s businesses to delay or forgo new investments or make costly adjustments to their supply chains and tariffs also result in retaliatory policies from trading partners reducing exports by american companies the report also added that the tariffs directly affect deficits and debt the report projected the federal budget deficit to increase to 1 trillion this year and will average 1 3 trillion per year through 2030 the federal debt is projected to grow from 81 of the gdp in 2020 to 98 of the gdp in 2030 and 180 of the gdp in 2050 and despite trump s claim that his policies have led to historic economic growth the cbo projects that the economy will grow by just 1 7 through 2030 trump had claimed that the economy would grow by 4 to 6 but growth has been barely over 2 in each of the last three quarters slower than during the final three years of the obama administration the cbo report is just the latest research showing the consequences to consumers from trump s trade war a 2019 new york federal reserve report showed that the costs of the tariffs were passed on entirely to consumers in the form of higher prices with no impact on foreign exporters a report by economists on the federal reserve board published in december further showed that the tariffs hurt the manufacturing industry that they were intended to protect the report found that the tariffs gave manufacturers a small boost but it was soon offset by larger drags from the effects of rising costs and retaliatory tariffs as a result manufacturing employment fell while prices to consumers continued to increase causing a recession in the manufacturing sector for much of last year the trade war has also hit the retail technology telecommunications and apparel industries many of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by china and other countries in response to trump s escalation also targeted farmers trump responded by announcing two farmer bailouts that were double the size of the 2009 auto bailout under former president barack obama the revenues raised by the tariffs imposed on china are nowhere near enough to cover the cost of the bailouts according to another report from the federal reserve bank of new york despite trump s attempt to throw taxpayer money at a problem of his own creation farm bankruptcies skyrocketed by 20 last year the biggest increase since the period following the 2007 08 economic crisis trump has argued that the pain of the

washington feb 8 2020 bss afp after emerging intact from his impeachment and trial us president donald trump can now trumpet his economic record as he battles to win re election in november the businessman turned politician inherited an economy in the upswing from his predecessor barack obama recovering from the ravages of the 2008 global financial crisis and rather than falter or die of old age the expansion has continued through trump s first three years in office giving him a trump card in the campaign to win a second term in november but there are some chinks in his armor as well as growing fears about the economic damage done by the coronavirus outbreak in china which raise doubts about how long the good times can last jobs gains continue jobs jobs jobs the president tweeted friday following a blockbuster employment report showing the us economy created 225 000 jobs last month he used the hashtag promisesmadepromiseskept last year job growth averaged 175 000 compared to 193 000 in 2018 and 176 000 in 2017 slower than the final three years of the obama administration the unemployment rate now at 3 6 percent near its lowest point in 50 years compared to 4 7 percent in december 2016 obama s last full month in office and joblessness in the hispanic and black communities has tumbled to historic lows for african americans the unemployment rate fell to 5 9 percent in december from 7 8 percent in december 2016 for hispanics it dropped to 4 2 percent from 5 9 percent average hourly earnings increased 2 9 percent in 2019 keeping slightly ahead of inflation record growth the economy is now in its 11th year of expansion a record period of growth but has fallen short of trump s lofty promises after reaching 1 5 percent gdp growth in 2016 the last year of obama s term in 2017 it climbed to 2 3 percent and the following year to 2 9 percent thanks to stimulus from the massive tax cut aimed mostly at corporations and the wealthiest americans and increased government spending particularly on the military but growth slowed to 2 3 percent last year after trump s trade war with china intensified which discouraged business investment while the us is in better shape than most advanced economies the eurozone grew only 1 2 percent it is unlikely to see long periods of 3 0 percent or higher as trump promised treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this week the economy could have hit the target last year were it not for the problems faced by boeing the aerospace giant has been in crisis mode since its top selling 737 max aircraft was grounded in march 2019 following two fatal crashes which shut down exports of the plane the imf predicts us growth will slow even further this year to 2 0 percent as the boost from the tax cut fades away deficits climbing the tax cuts approved by congress at the end of 2017 the most significant tax reform in 30 years helped boost gdp growth but also drove government debt and the deficit higher the reform cut income taxes on the richest americans while slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent the budget deficit is projected to breach 1 trillion by the end of september according to the congressional budget office while government debt is expected to represent 81 percent of us gdp mnuchin said trump is planning to slash taxes for the middle class as well trade tensions eased trump has congratulated himself on signing a momentous initial trade deal last month to end the long battle with beijing but at what cost china pledged to buy some 200 billion in us goods but tariffs on about two thirds of the goods traded between the economic powers remain in place and the conflict slowed us and global growth and sent domestic manufacturing into a recession trump did fulfill his campaign promise to renegotiate the 1994 continental free trade deal with mexico and canada creating the usmca the new pact also signed in january replaces what trump called the worst trade deal in us history though experts say it amounts to an update rather than an overhaul booming stock market wall street has cheered the tax cuts and loosening of regulations by the trump administration gaining around 55 percent since he was elected on november 8 2016 that will be another selling point to americans whose retirement wealth depends in large part on stock prices

cash generation we ended the year with approximately 200 million of cash on hand and as a result of good operational execution highlighted by a 91 million second half inventory reduction which exceeded our initial target of 80 million on essentially flat year over year revenue we delivered over 40 million of additional adjusted ebitda david will provide more color on the financials for the year but i d like to bring your attention to the adjusted ebitda percentage for the year it was 8 5 this represented a 220 basis point improvement year over year and is evidence that 10 is not too far off if market conditions cooperate a great tribute to our ability to drive incremental improvement in all that we do our financial performance was a result of almost 5 000 employees working together as a team and making day to day improvements to the business i d like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the most impactful accomplishments in the year the one accomplishment that i m most proud of is our 2019 safety results our most important goal is to create a zero incident workplace our safety measurables have always been better than the industry average but that s not good enough we continue to strive for improvement in our workplace through our hazard reduction program called slam which stands for stop look assess and manage our slam activity increased threefold in 2019 to over 18 000 assessments globally you can find slam cards at every value stream throughout all of our factories while we re not at zero injuries yet we are absolutely determined to achieve this goal last march we completed the recapitalization of our debt structure which greatly reduced our borrowing cost and now allow us to deploy our capital to pursue multiple exciting new options we now have the flexibility to pursue acquisition targets that will provide us the ability to continue to expand our margins while providing stable recurring revenue streams while we have been talking about potential acquisitions for a few quarters we have a good pipeline of opportunities and will remain true to our disciplined criteria when evaluating each opportunity ensuring accretive earnings in year 1 of any acquisition in 2019 we continued our investments in new products by introducing 10 new models all of which were designed utilizing the voice of customer and brought to market much quicker than in the past six of these models were unveiled at the bauma trade show last april customer response to our new models has been outstanding as our cranes are delivering the quality that customers expect from us and are providing superior returns on their invested capital our innovation pipeline remains robust and we are excited to introduce six new cranes at the conexpo trade show in las vegas i cannot share more detail on these cranes yet but i am confident that these new models will contribute to the continued market share expansion and further add to our recent successes our voice of customer process was vital in achieving another milestone in our growth strategy for the first time in manitowoc s history a new tower crane was designed and developed by our china team specifically for the asia pac market not only was the six month development time remarkable and much shorter than what was achieved in the past the crane was also met with excellent customer acception with demand exceeding our expectations additionally we made great progress in the adaptation of the manitowoc way by continuing to improve productivity in our operations eliminate waste and accelerate velocity last month i visited our teams at our aftermarket center in lyon france our top slewing tower crane factory in moulins france and our all terrain crane factory in wilhelmshaven germany it was obvious during my this visit and the locations have implemented focused actions that touch safety 5s tpm smed and one piece flow my biggest takeaway however was the shift in the mindset relative to the manitowoc way the work culture is used in defining business culture is a set of shared attitudes values goals and practices that characterize an institutional organization after reflecting on my plant visits and others i remain convinced that the culture we set out to achieve with guiding principles of the manitowoc way continues to transform our organization if my words don t define our culture no one can argue that our results do lean thinking is part of our operational dna i wanted to spend a minute talking about our multipurpose aftermarket facility in lyon france manitowoc has merged three facilities into one in order to improve velocity and efficiency and serving our mobile and tower crane customers through parts availability training and service in 2019 our parts inventory fill rates reached record levels in excess of 90 our order lines are fulfilled same day from available stock and we shipped over 225 000 line items last year parts order to shipment velocity is continuously improving and our customers are benefiting from this consolidation the facility has attracted some of the highest skilled trained crane experts in the world to become trainers and grow manitowoc s global service network capability our field service technicians gain a lot of value from this centralization with both the skills from the training center and the parts distribution center at their disposal we are already working on how we can automate the use of our cranestar diag through an app to aid our technicians when they are dispatched to a crane which needs service ultimately improving our customers experience with the crane great job aftermarket team i m proud of what we ve accomplished in 2019 as well as the rest of our value streams globally which help drive the financial results that david will discuss next david david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks barry and good morning everyone let s move to slide 3 our fourth quarter orders totaled 472 million a decrease of 3 compared to 486 million of orders last year on a currency neutral basis q4 orders were down 9 million or 2 the q4 winter campaign in our european towers business drove an increase in year over year regional orders but this increase was more than offset by declines in the americas region our 2019 ending backlog of 475 million was down 29 over the prior year 28 on a currency neutral basis the decrease in backlog was mainly due to a decline in the americas region net sales in the fourth quarter of 463 million were slightly below our expectations and decreased 52 million or 10 from a year ago with each of our three regions incurring a year over year decline net sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately 1 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates our adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 31 million essentially flat year over year the decrease in gross profit dollars associated with the sales decline was completely offset by reduced engineering selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales adjusted ebitda margin improved to 6 7 of sales 70 basis points over the prior year and marking our 11th consecutive quarter of year over year ebitda margin improvement during the fourth quarter we incurred approximately 2 million of restructuring expenses predominantly related to european severance costs our diluted earnings per share in the quarter was 0 26 on an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share improved 0 19 from the prior year to 0 35 per diluted share lower interest expense and tax expense coupled with favorable currency transactions were the main contributors to the year over year increase in adjusted eps moving to liquidity our adjusted operating cash flow in the quarter was outstanding as we generated 145 million an improvement of 109 million over the prior year this was driven by the significant reduction in inventory along with strong cash collections our year end cash balance improved by 59 million to 199 million with no borrowings outstanding on our abl now i would like to recap the results for the full year 2019 was another successful year of operational execution and continued margin expansion in spite of our year over year quarter decline net sales for the year totaled 1 834 billion slightly below the prior year net sales for the year were negatively affected by 44 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates adjusting for foreign exchange rates net sales would have grown 31 million or 2 as barry has highlighted the importance of our aftermarket business in his previous remarks our goal is to increase our recurring revenue stream during 2019 our aftermarket revenue grew by 2 on a currency neutral basis with overall margins improving as a percentage of total sales our aftermarket business was over 18 during the quarter this was a key contributor to our excellent 2019 financial performance our adjusted ebitda improved 41 million or 35 over the prior year on essentially flat revenue in addition our adjusted ebitda margin improved by 220 basis points to 8 5 net of sales disciplined pricing actions better manufacturing performance and lower engineering selling and administrative expenses contributed to the year over year increase our full year 2019 adjusted net income from continuing operations improved by 45 million adjusted diluted earnings per share were 1 89 an improvement of 1 25 over 2018 our share repurchases during the year favorably impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately 0 01 full year adjusted operating cash flows were 148 million compared to use of 3 million in 2018 in both cases after adjusting for the elimination of our accounts receivable securitization program which occurred in 2019 this resulted in a 2019 conversion rate of 220 to adjusted net income as of december 31 our total liquidity was 445 million as compared to 276 million as of december 31 2018 turning to slide 4 we are now providing our 2020 full year guidance as follows revenue of approximately 1 6 billion to 1 7 billion adjusted ebitda of approximately 85 million to 115 million depreciation expense of approximately 35 million to 37 million restructuring expense of approximately 4 million to 6 million interest expense of approximately 28 million to 30 million income tax expense of approximately 11 million to 15 million excluding discrete items and capital expenditures of approximately 30 million with that i will now turn the call back to barry barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer thank you david we all know that the crane industry is a cyclical one influenced by numerous factors looking at 2020 we see continued uncertainty in global economic conditions the health crisis in china geopolitical friction in developing regions of the world the falloff from brexit and election in the u s all contribute to an era of conservatism in demand for our products in north america we re not alone in facing what appears to be a softening of construction in oil and gas end market demand we are carefully monitoring retail activity and expect conexpo to be the barometer of market conditions for 2020 in north america in euraf q4 order activity improved year over year we will continue to monitor market conditions and proactively manage our build schedules as we always have in the meap region we continue to be encouraged with demand levels particularly in australia but the possibility of further coronavirus spread in china may lead to a longer than expected plant shutdown which complicates our outlook middle east demand continues to lag behind historical levels but is starting to show signs of life here in the recent past we are not sitting idle but rather are proactively following our strategic road map to attain our long term goals by leveraging our flexible cost structure and focusing on the items within our control we are ready to respond quickly to changes in demand by flexing our production schedules as circumstances warrant part of managing a cyclical business is to face the brutal facts our guidance reflects our current thinking of market conditions globally which result in lower revenue expectations for 2020 just like you we don t like it but our history shows we proactively deal with it and we will we will play the hand we are dealt and by continuing to focus on our customers shareholders and employees and by targeting our investments to the ones that yield the highest returns we will position manitowoc positively when market conditions improve with that operator please open up the line for questions questions answers operator yes sir thank you and we will take our first question from jamie cook with credit suisse jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning i guess just my first question just on the guidance i think with the midpoint of the sales decline it assumes sort of decrementals in the 30 range or so so can you just walk me through some of your assumptions on the engineering selling and administrative line and on the gross margin line i just was hopeful there will be a little more opportunity to hold a better decremental or maybe it s just we ve cut too much so i guess first there and then i guess my second question how you re sort of thinking about free cash flow for 2020 thank you barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer well jamie there s always opportunity for us within our sg a for reductions we are giving you what we think is our best look currently but rest assured that with the level of sg a we have in the business we certainly are not finished with pulling the levers that we need to pull and we will as market conditions dictate flex this up or down depending upon what we need to accomplish for our customers in the future with regards to the decrements i will turn it over to david and free cash flow david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah hi good morning jamie so just to remind you we previously communicated an expectation of between 25 and 30 flow through to ebitda and revenue decreases and if you recall in the second quarter of 2019 we recognized a 9 million favorable legal settlement so after taking this into consideration and using the midpoint of our guidance we would reflect the flow through within that range and i believe it comes to about 26 whereas excluding it would give you the decrement of just over 30 and then with regard to your second question on free cash flow we re anticipating between 30 million and 60 million of free cash flow in 2020 based on our current revenue assumptions jamie cook credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question will come from mig dobre with baird mig dobre baird analyst thank you good morning everyone wanted to ask a question about guidance as well on the revenue side though so the way i m kind of looking at it if i look at 2019 orders you were at about call it 1 64 billion the midpoint of your 2020 guidance is 1 65 billion is it that you re essentially saying that demand is going to be flattish versus 2019 and 2020 or in your own assumptions are you baking in some level of backlog erosion as the year progresses barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer market conditions pretty much globally we believe will remain constant for the year but we do believe we will be eating in the backlog mig dobre baird analyst so backlog would be modestly lower i guess i m just trying to understand exactly how you re thinking about demand just pure demand in terms of orders for 2020 versus 19 and from what you re saying you re expecting orders to be maybe modestly lower barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer modestly lower to the flat as i said in my prepared remarks i mean a substantial portion of what we will be able to accomplish this year will be dependent upon conexpo conexpo historically has been an order taking show we know from past experience as well as talking to some of the customers that we talk to on a regular basis that they will be coming with their purchase orders in hand we don t expect that purchase order in hand to be much stronger than what we exhibited last year but we certainly do not expect it to be down dramatically mig dobre baird analyst ok very helpful and then my follow up in terms of how you re thinking about your own production cadence through the year given your top line outlook anything to call out in terms of the first half second half or first quarter specifically barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer we believe our first half i will just back up and say the full year we have seen from normal seasonality over the course of the last four years mig dobre baird analyst all right thank you barry barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator we will now take our next question from stephen volkmann with jefferies stephen volkmann jefferies analyst hi good morning guys actually i d like to kind of go back to jamie s question if we could and dave thanks for the view on decremental margins i guess many of us and maybe this is our fault but we sort of assume that base case 25 to 30 decremental but then you would have the opportunity to add back various restructuring and or lean benefits on top of that and obviously you did that in 2019 and had a great margin performance and so i guess the question is are you running out of low hanging fruit on the margin side and now you re just sort of at the whim of the market to some extent or are there still significant internal improvements that you can make going forward and if so why the conservative outlook on margins barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer well to be honest with you the conservative outlook on margins is because we re a conservative management team but for me to sit here and say that i felt long term and i still believe long term we can get 10 operating margins and ebitda margins in this business to say that i would believe that we only need market to do that is absurd of course as i said i visited three of our largest facilities in europe in the month of january and there is not one single facility that i went in where i would say oh boy we are out of opportunity for margin expansion so the manitowoc way the culture is alive and well but when we take the revenue reduction that we have this year coupled with the fact that market conditions are pretty much flat on a global basis which doesn t lead you to the opportunity we believe to lift on price maybe have to give some price back we have to offset that with the improvements in the plant therefore that s why i would say that by no means will we ever sit here and say that we re out of opportunities for margin expansion from our plan standpoint david you can pick up the rest david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so steve thanks very much for your question i think when we look at where we are right now in the plan and we look at the phasing of our backlog and where we are right now i think that it generally reflects our approach that the business continues to operate on a flat to slightly down order backlog and depending on how that takes out will result in actions later on this year most likely so but at this point in time structurally the company is as is and this contemplates where our order intake will be relative to the full year stephen volkmann jefferies analyst is there anything going on in terms of mix that might be a headwind for margin in 2020 barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer absolutely david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer yes we do have product mix issues that are within the product family so when i look at where our higher margin products are we probably have a decline for even within product categories higher margin products being substituted for a little bit lower margin products within that product family so mix does play an issue within this as well stephen volkmann jefferies analyst thank you guys operator our next question comes from ann duignan with jp morgan thomas simonitsch j p morgan analyst sorry i was on mute this is thomas simonitsch on for ann could you maybe just provide some more color on how q4 orders trended in the americas by products particularly if you saw any further deterioration in oil and gas markets barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer yes so i mean we don t typically give out by product line details but in my prepared remarks i did indicate that we did have an increase in orders in our europe region on a year over year basis that were more than offsetting declines in the americas and that s why barry indicated that wait and see how conexpo comes out because we re not quite sure how much of the orders are being put on the shelf until conexpo comes about so orders were down in americas and they were up in europe thomas simonitsch j p morgan analyst ok and just a follow up on conexpo you noting the potential order patterns around the show but can you clarify the expected show related costs in q1 barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer it s around 3 million thomas simonitsch j p morgan analyst thank you very much barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer you are welcome operator next question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning you folks have been able to as you deliver new products deliver them at a better manufacturing margins can you just talk about out of the products that you re going to be delivering for conexpo later on this year what the embedded improved built in margin but i m assuming you re setting up on those products as we head into production barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer well not really because we don t really provide that but what i would say is that we don t when we introduce the new crane there s so much overhead associated with the cost of prototypes in particular to test those cranes but we really don t expect that in the first six to nine months to get margin expansion as a result of the new product introduction and maybe david could provide a little more color on that but really what we re doing is the way we account for it is that those prototype costs need to be absorbed from the revenue and then after that the six to nine month period is when we truly see margin expansion coming back to us david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer and barry yes just to add on to that jerry so what ends up happening is that we do build prototype cranes that then go into our inventory that we use for all testing for quite an extended period of time and those cranes are probably at a higher cost level associated because of the time requirements and everything and then once we have a sales plan device for that what we then do is we then go outsourcing and we end up with lower sourcing costs for a lot of the material use within that crane so it s a lower margin on the onset and the margins get better as time goes on jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and david when you say better i m assuming that means better than the product line that s being replaced david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer correct jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and then you of course controlled sg a costs nicely in 19 and given the sales outlook for 20 do you anticipate being able to reduce sg a costs in line with the top line decline or does that drop a little bit barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer we re going to continue to target sg a reductions as i said we are still in the process of transforming the portfolio and we have targeted investments that need to take place particularly in europe with regards to emissions so that will be almost a fixed portion of sg a for the year which will not allow us to get a substantial reduction out of that but rest assured that every dollar of sg a is under constant scrutiny and we are far from the ability to not pull levers david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer and then jerry just to add on to what barry said just be cognizant of the fact that in that second quarter sg a was favorably impacted by approximately 9 million jerry revich goldman sachs analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from mike shlisky with dougherty company mike shlisky dougherty and company analyst hey good morning guys in earlier question you had mentioned you have to maybe give back some price this year in some cases i was wondering if you can give us a sense as to what parts of the world that could be happening in and whether there are opportunities in other parts of the world to actually get some better price barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer well we re always looking at the opportunity to increase price but when you see the things that some of our competition are doing that appear to be irrational we have to be able to participate in market areas that we targeted for share gains so i guess that s a winded way of saying that when we believe the revenue in the u s is going to be down as much as it is according to our current forecast we d seen for us to think that we would not have to give some price but we will fight as hard as we can to keep what we ve done in the market and in some cases we ve walked away from some business already because of crazy pricing that happens from some of our competition so it s not a strategy believe me to give back price but strategically when we need to we will mike shlisky dougherty and company analyst sure sure thanks and my other question my follow up is i was kind of glad to see that you had growth of aftermarket in 2019 on a constant currency basis that was great to see do you think there are opportunities for further growth here in 2020 and can you maybe just kind of take us through a few of our initiatives and strategy for the coming year barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer absolutely as i tried to telegraph a little bit in our prepared remarks in europe we are trying to utilize technology that we have already built into the cranes with cranestar diag our diagnostic tool with our servicemen who are now all co located in lyon france so that they can actually when a call comes in from a customer our fill people that are taking the order for a service can tie into the crane see what the issue is give the technician the parts that he needs to fix the crane and dispatch him accordingly so we are absolutely resolute on focusing on the aftermarket and as i ve stated in the past it s a substantial portion of what our acquisition strategy is to make sure that everything we do inorganically is aimed at increasing our recurring revenue percentage of sales mike shlisky dougherty and company analyst ok but just to clarify if folks are buying a little less new this year and they choose to use their older cranes there are opportunities for additional just parts revenue straight up parts revenue in the coming year barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer straight yes absolutely mike shlisky dougherty and company analyst barry thank you so much barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator we will now take our next question from seth weber with rbc capital markets seth weber rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys i guess kind of working for about 5 million of restructuring expense in 2020 which will be down from 2019 what are you looking for to get more aggressive with some restructuring and some additional facility actions i mean what would it take i guess for you to kind of take that to another level at this point given currently pretty muted market conditions thanks barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer ok so in north america we have one facility right so i mean to say that we re going to do a facility rationalization in north america i think is just not in the cards you heard me also say that in my prepared remarks that our european order rate in the quarter was up so to think that we are in a situation where we re going to be able to do a quick plant rationalization in europe with our order rates up is also not in the cards so that leaves our operation in china and if anything we will be expanding our presence in china so there won t be any restructuring there so we know of where the 5 million is going to go anything beyond that we will continue to update you as the year goes on seth weber rbc capital markets analyst ok fair enough second just a follow up question the product warranty expense has been moving higher is there anything of note there that you d call out is there a particular product or particular site that s giving you some challenges thanks barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer i would just say it s you re right product warranty is up a bit on a year over year basis it s predominantly in europe where we re seeing some of these things but we don t typically give specifics on that we took a conservative approach as to the product warranties and we believe that some of the changes that we re going to be making and some of the things that we re going to be rolling out to the field will help that so i would say it s just teething issues on new products and normal from a normal standpoint but nothing extraordinary seth nothing structurally that i would say is the driver seth weber rbc capital markets analyst ok and so just to go back to mike s question on pricing i think it was mike s question is that a function of are the competitors getting aggressive because there s too much industry inventory how would you characterize industry inventory i guess thanks barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer yes i mean in the u s there s a lot of industry inventory i mean we know where our competitors store their inventory and we do drive by and there s a lot of it there you drive by our factories you don t see a lot of inventory in shady grove the inventory that you see is our dealer stock because we basically are not producing inventory so the industry itself in north america does have i think a little bit too much inventory which is why we have taken the view that we ve taken in north america for this year there s a lot of dealer inventory in north america currently seth weber rbc capital markets analyst i appreciate it guys thank you very much barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator we will now take our next question from stanley elliott with stifel stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst hey good morning guys thank you for squeezing me in a quick question on the products that you re going to launch or show at conexpo how quickly can you ship those products is that going to be later 2020 event and then curious to what extent the prototyping within that is impacting kind of the 200 basis point delta on the margins barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer some of the products will be available for sale immediately and some of the products might one of the products might go as late as the beginning of 2021 for shipments stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst perfect then dave we talked about kind of the 30 million to 60 million of free cash flow kind of what are expectations for inventory because i imagine you ve got obviously you ve got the sales decline but then i would imagine there s going to be some level of build just to support all of the six new launches so how do we think about ending inventory into 2020 david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so great question stanley i think generally speaking we feel we have opportunities in our inventory and that s surely baked into our guidance of 30 million to 60 million in free cash flow and it s one of the primary drivers of it stanley elliott stifel financial corp analyst perfect guys thank you very much thanks a lot david antoniuk senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer thank you operator we will now take a follow up from mig dobre with baird mig dobre baird analyst hey guys thanks for taking the follow up i appreciate the color on new equipment pricing but i also know quite a bit about used crane prices is there any color that you can give us there and if you can also comment by geography i d be curious on that as well thanks barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer we track most of our the used inventory in the u s we don t own very much of it any longer we did do a good job in my opinion of liquidating most of that it s almost a pause if you will in used equipment sales outside of the u s some of that has to do with the aggressive nature of the chinese the belt and road countries a substantial portion of the used cranes that used to leave the u s went to regions where the chinese have now infiltrated with their lower priced cranes however we still believe that as we see south america particularly brazil begin its recovery we believe there is a market for the cranes that are used here in the u s and i believe that we will continue to see opportunities mig dobre baird analyst and i m sorry if i missed this but as far as u s used crane prices barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer stable mig dobre baird analyst great appreciate it thank you barry pennypacker president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator and that does conclude our question and answer session for today i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr warner for any additional or closing remarks ion warner vice president of marketing and investor relations thank you before we conclude today s call please note that a

palmer our chief financial officer i will start today by providing an update on our first quarter and i will then turn the call over the ned for few additional comments finally alan will review our financial results before we take your questions we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter that produced double digit year over year growth in revenue gross profit and adjusted ebitda this growth was driven both by improved performance in our existing markets and by recent strategic acquisitions in florida and alabama the first half of our fiscal year historically produces approximately 40 of our annual revenue based on the seasonality of our business and these first quarter results are in line with our expectations we continue to see sustained demand across our 33 distinct markets for road repair and maintenance work we also see sustained competition in this business we are competing every day for work our team is focused on reducing costs and maximizing efficiencies throughout our organization and construction project work to achieve profitable growth it is important to point out that the flexibility of our model provides opportunities to pursue projects that will allow us to enhance the utilization of our workforce and equipment we continue to pursue projects both public and private that all possess the best opportunity to grow profitability i know the key aspect of our business is our geographic diversity operating across 33 separate markets in multiple states we have exposure to different local economic environments on the private side and on the public side we have five different state dots and a large number of other public entities that we can work with throughout these markets this diversity allows us to bid on both public and private projects to maximize our vertically integrated business model turning to our recent acquisitions we have fully integrated the acquisition we made in october which is a hot mix asphalt plant and paving company in high growth area of the florida east coast we have now successfully completed five acquisitions since our ipo in may 2018 and a total of 20 acquisitions since founding the business in 2001 we are pleased with the performance of the operations we acquired in florida and alabama we continue to see growth opportunities in those markets in florida in particular where we now have a broader footprint in the eastern side of the state we expect these markets to benefit from the close proximity and enhanced vertical integration with our diverse equipment fleet and workforce capable of forming a broad range of services we believe they are meaningful opportunities to add scale drive growth and provide value for our customers as we progress through fiscal 2020 we will continue to consistently execute the strategy of controlled profitable growth utilizing three primary levers by doing more work in our core market by making strategic acquisitions and by expanding through green field opportunities we continue to have active conversations with potential acquisition candidates we also remain patient with acquisition opportunities and evaluate prospects that best fit our strategy before turning the call over to ned i would like to thank our senior management team for their leadership and i would also like to thank our more than 2 200 employees for their dedication and hard work that enable us to execute our strategy now i ll turn the call over to ned fleming our executive chairman for a few additional comments ned ned n fleming executive chairman thank you charles and good morning to everyone the team delivered an excellent first quarter as charles and alan have expressed many times this is a seasonal business that ramps up throughout the year and expands from both a top line and a profitability standpoint during the second half of the year so as we evaluate our first quarter results and look at the opportunities to come throughout the year with a combination of projected company growth and a number of potential acquisition candidates in markets of interest to us we are truly excited about our future quite simply the positive supply and demand dynamics of our business have remained pretty much the same since we started the cpi in 2001 roads are deteriorating and local state and federal government plans are being used to prepare them in fact i might argue that those dynamics are even better today because the deteriorating road conditions across the country have not improved and in most places have worsened and more and more states are taking ownership by implementing gas taxes to help maintain and improve roadways in their states which is exactly what has happened in all the states we operate in as charles mentioned we have a flexible model enabling the team to work on private or public projects across the 33 unique mini economies in which we compete some of our markets are experiencing good economic growth right now others have less growth and others might be down or slightly flat however our broad geographic diversity brings stability and consistency to the company also we have the flexibility to move equipment and crews and the ability to do different size in all type projects which further differentiates us from many of our competitors over the last 20 years our business model has shown resilience and consistency in different economic and competitive environments the team is committed to continually improving business processes to grow revenues and margins the opportunities today to utilize technology integrate more efficient processes benefit from a more flexible organization to drive efficiency are terrific as the entire cpi teams continue to execute at a high level led by seasoned and experienced operators across the organization we plan to continue to deliver strong results consistent with our strategy for achieving controlled profitable growth throughout the year we plan to continue to tell our story to investors which we believe provides a very compelling investment thesis the team continues to work hard to enhance financial results cash generation and maximize value for our shareholders as well as all the stakeholders and with that i d like to turn the call over to our cfo alan palmer alan alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you ned and good morning everyone i want to start by quickly highlighting our key performance metrics in the first quarter from a financial standpoint as charles mentioned year over year growth in the first quarter was driven by improved performance in our existing markets and by the recent strategic acquisitions in florida and alabama revenue for the quarter increased to 175 3 million up 21 million over the same quarter last year organic revenue growth was approximately 7 9 million and acquisitive revenue growth was approximately 13 1 million attributable to acquisitions completed subsequent to the quarter ended december 31 2018 gross profit increased to 23 8 million up approximately 2 6 million over the same period last year primarily due to higher revenue and higher margin net income was 5 5 million up from 5 2 million compared to the same quarter last year earnings per share were 0 11 compared to 0 10 per share last year note that interest expense declined approximately 235 000 compared to the same quarter last year due to a decrease in the average interest rate as a result of amending our credit agreement in june 2019 our effective tax rate was 19 5 compared to 24 3 for the same period last year the lower effective tax rate was due to a discrete tax reduction of 363 000 in the quarter related to an amended state income tax return we expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year to be approximately 25 2 adjusted ebitda increased approximately 2 5 million to 17 2 million resulting in an adjusted ebitda margin of 9 8 compared to 9 5 in the first quarter last year the higher adjusted ebitda was a combination of higher gross profit and depreciation depletion and amortization partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were 17 1 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to last year of 14 4 million the 2 7 million increase was primarily the result of a 1 4 million increase in management personnel payroll and benefits of 797 000 increase attributable to acquisitions completed subsequent to december 31 2018 and then 395 000 increase in stock compensation expense turning now to the balance sheet at december 31 2019 we had 49 4 million of cash and 13 6 million of availability under our 30 million revolving credit facility after deducting outstanding letters of credit our debt to trailing 12 months ebitda ratio was less than 1 time at 0 73 we have a very strong balance sheet to support our growth opportunities cash provided by operating activities was 1 5 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 compared to 1 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 capex in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 23 6 million excluding approximately 11 5 million to purchase certain equipment that was previously subject to operating leases our capex was 12 1 million in the first quarter compared to 7 4 million in the same quarter last year for fiscal 2020 we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of 44 million to 47 million excluding the 11 5 million purchase of equipment that was previously subject to operating leases project backlog at december 31 2019 was 539 1 million compared to 531 6 million at september 30 2019 and 572 million at december 31 2018 of our current 539 million in backlog approximately 75 or 403 million is expected to be completed during the remainder of our fiscal year we maintain a construction backlog composed primarily of recurring maintenance related projects of the type that we prefer and we continue to see opportunities to bid on these projects in our markets keep in mind that we focus on our backlog in 33 distinct markets meaning we want to have six to nine months of backlog in our markets as these market specific backlogs are aggregated for our companywide backlog while the overall amount can fluctuate quarter over quarter based on several large projects either being added or completed we focus on the overall health of backlog in terms of the next 12 months in each specific market we also maintain a disciplined approach to strategically focus on recurring repair and maintenance projects historically our backlog builds during our second and third quarters as more of these projects are typically let in february through may we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2020 based on our historical experience of generating approximately 40 of our revenue in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 60 during the second half our fiscal year 2020 outlook with regard to revenue net income and adjusted ebitda are as follows revenue of 830 million to 870 million compared to 783 2 million in fiscal year 2019 net income of 39 million to 44 million compared to 43 1 million in fiscal year 2019 and adjusted ebitda of 94 million to 102 million compared to 92 3 million in fiscal year 2019 in summary we are pleased with our first quarter results and we continue to see positive market trends and project demand in fiscal 2020 with that we ll now take questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting the question and answer session our first question comes from the line of michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed okay and we will move on to our next question which comes from the line of adam thalhimer with thompson davis please proceed with your question adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst hey good morning guys nice quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning thank you adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst so can you give us a little more color on you said you d like to have six to nine months of backlog in your specific markets can you give us a little more color on how you re how you guys view the current level of backlog alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer considering the time of the year we re pleased with it we do expect with the projects that we ve got available coming up in the next few months and what we ve already seen as far as our bid results in january for that to build like it typically would going into the second the end of the second quarter and then there will not be as much build in the third and fourth because we do so much of our revenue but we see a lot of good opportunities out in front of us in many of our markets to be able to build that backlog some more adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst and then curious on the seasonality of ebitda last couple of years ebitda has declined from december to march before it picked up in the back half is that would you expect a similar trend this year alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes as generally our volume in our second quarter which is january through march is the lowest volume of the year so a lot of the fixed cost that we incur in january especially in repairs of plants and equipment and the slowdown they impact that margin our job margins are fairly consistent throughout the year but the plants and equipment accounts are the ones where we have a lot of fixed costs that we ll incur in that quarter with a lot lower revenue so that s usually our lowest gross profit core adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst okay thank you alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question mr feniger your line is live michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah can you hear me alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes good morning mike michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah sorry yeah good morning sorry about that i think i might have i apologize i think i m sorry if i make you guys repeat your question here with maybe we could just touch on the sg a i think it was pretty high as a percent of sales i know there is a seasonal impact with the lower revenue and maybe you just touched on this with the question prior but is there anything we should be aware of with costs from new acquisitions or something that was running a little bit higher in the first quarter and how that might trend through the rest of the year alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in the first quarter we had about 800 000 of g a that was related to acquisitions that we didn t have in the same quarter last year so quarter over quarter this year to last year that was part of that we also had some about 400 000 of non cash equity related to the directors last year chose to take their directors compensation in stock instead of cash and so that was a non cash that we did not have in the same quarter last year then the other was just primarily increase in staff that we ve added in the administrative level we also have some expenses in our first quarter that occur in that quarter for safety awards and other type of employee costs that generally are they re paid prior to in december prior to the end of our first quarter so that kind of bump up that first quarter that amount should trend down in the second third and fourth absent any additional acquisitions so the run rate in for overhead in this first quarter should be the highest for the year michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and then i m just curious like the fast act authorization i think expires in september of this year look i think you guys have been in this industry a long time you ve seen this before i m just curious if you could flag to us how we should see the markets evolving how dot budgets kind of evolve as we approach september if any changes at all charles e owens president and chief executive officer hi this is charles we really don t see any major impact at all just kind of almost become a standard for these things to expire and then they get funded through our crs until so we really don t anticipate any slowdown we still got a lot of tailwind in our back with a lot of the states that s gas tax is have kicked in and they continue to kick in and obviously we don t have anything in our model based on anything new but we re just think it s going to be business as usual alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we are the state of the union address and then the rebuttal by the democratic party and i think their first comment was about infrastructure bill so there s certainly a consensus across all the political spectrum to get something done and we are hopeful that that might get done before the fast act expires but as charles said if it doesn t continuing resolutions are a normal part of it and the dots have gotten very accustomed to that in the last 10 years michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst that makes sense and if i could just squeeze one on the private side i mean i know we re talking a lot about the public side just are you guys observing anything in your districts on the private side that suggests alarm there has been some concerns on the non resi construction side in some areas in some states i am just curious if you guys are observing any of that in your book of business charles e owens president and chief executive officer in a private side we re still seeing a lot of commercial and we re still seeing a little bit of residential that s kind of been normal but that s a business that we don t chase too hard is that once related strictly to the residential developments because a little bit of their cyclicality but in the markets that we re in we re still seeing a very strong economy we re still seeing a lot of work being let and so far the markets that we re in we are very positive that that is going to be a continuation for the next several months michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst fair enough operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from andrew wittmann with robert w baird please proceed andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst great thanks good morning guys i guess my first question is probably here for alan and i just wanted to talk about the capex number you guys called out last quarter very clearly that you d have this kind of operating lease buyout alan i was hoping you could just give us just give all the investors here a little bit of a flavor of the types of things that were involved in those leases and if you could it would be very helpful for you to quantify the amount of lease expense or rent expense on those operating leases that was previously expense that s now going to turn into depreciation on a go forward basis alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer okay the amount that we bought out in october was 11 5 million this is a fair market value of those leases so and from a depreciation standpoint that would equate to approximately 2 million a year i don t have an exact lease expense amount but it probably would be 2 5 million i would say but i can get that exact number because we did our analysis of whether to buy it out but so that and that was for us that was figured into our 2020 budget because we knew we were going to do those because those leases were going to go on our books one way or the other as a capital asset and we also if you when you look at the balance sheet you will see that we booked about another 8 5 million worth of the value of operating lease assets because we became subject to the new lease standards october 1 but to the first part of the question all of that would have been equipment related that we bought out so those would have been operating leases for bulldozers rollers trucks there were a good number of dump trucks that we had leased and then some other heavy equipment so that s the type of things that we had on operating leases we still have some of that but we have a number of locations that we lease properties that our asphalt plants are sitting on whether it d be in a quarry or just outside of a quarry and so that is the majority of what is in that operating right of use asset so there are some additional yellow iron but not a lot andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst that s helpful color thank you for that and just kind of another aspect here of the cash flow here is it calculated here the dsos are up decent number of days sequentially and i was just wondering if you could kind of give some of the mechanics behind that certainly the fact that you did an acquisition in the quarter you don t get all the revenue in that quarter from that acquisition but you do book all the receivables i have to imagine that s part of it but i don t know if you could help just understand what s going on here because last quarter there was a lot of discussion about how there are some state dots that were paying you kind of slow and you saw the catch up on that and so i just thought it d be helpful for everyone to hear a little bit about the status of some of those receivables that you ve talked about last quarter and have it relate back here to the dso calculation alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and we do expect to for that to have the delays from the dot to have less impact as we go through the year unfortunately the first quarter december specifically there are a lot of holidays and while our accounts payable people weren t taking off we kept paying our bills a lot of the customers took advantage of the holidays and said they d pay us in january so from a past due standpoint which is really what we look at we are still in good shape there we have very few write offs of receivables and certainly not on the public side but the delay in collecting some of them is still it s still real but it should not increase and we do feel like we can get back a little bit more on track in the second quarter because we won t have the holidays where they take off for the last week or two which is when we often get paid from the dots andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful and then i guess just my last question here it has to do with the comments from the prepared remarks you kind of mentioned that you see continued state growth but there s also sustained competition charles i was wondering if you could just expand upon that a little bit are you seeing is the competition pricing any differently or going about their business any differently are you referring to anything specifically that you saw here during the quarter or new entrants things of that i just thought maybe kind of expanding upon that commentary on the competition would be helpful charles e owens president and chief executive officer from a competitive standpoint obviously this business is a very competitive business and it s always been but as far as anything that we see any different that we normally haven t seen it s we re not seeing anything that i guess the point i brought up was that every job we get that is normally on a competitive basis and that s one reason that we have to work so hard to improve our efficiencies and really understand our markets so we can maximize our profitability andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst okay good i ll leave it there thank you very much charles e owens president and chief executive officer thank you andy operator thank you our next question is from trey grooms with stephens please proceed noah merkousko stephens analyst hi this is actually noah merkousko on for trey alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer hey good morning noah merkousko stephens analyst good morning so my first question it looks like the adjusted ebitda margin was up about 30 bps but it came in a little bit lower than we were expecting is this in line with your expectations and maybe was there anything in the quarter that pressured the margins more than you had originally thought alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer it was very much in line with our expectations as far as what we expected we our jobs performed at a very good level in the quarter we had enough volume going through the plants and the equipment that they were in line actually the plants were slightly better and the equipment just slightly more cost than we had so overall those were in line we were pleased with our external sales that contribute to that and the performance of the liquid asphalt terminal so we were actually at the gross profit line we were a little bit higher than what we anticipated on that revenue and then i ve talked a little bit about the g a that was a little bit higher than what our expectation was but again part of that is due to those costs that come in in that fourth quarter that when we re budgeting they re more equal throughout the year so and then we had about almost 700 000 800 000 i think it was of acquisition cost in the quarter so but overall the overall margin was just maybe 10 basis points above what we expected noah merkousko stephens analyst okay that s helpful and then just to follow up on that your guide implies an ebitda margin of 11 5 how should we think about that ramping up last year i think the back half saw that margin 4 to 5 higher is that would that be a good assumption to use for this year alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that should be pretty much in line the second quarter historically is going to be the lowest margin if we follow the typical and then that third and fourth quarter is when it s generally going to be 4 5 higher and then you average out to that 11 because you re going to do about 60 of your work in that quarter so it s not only going to be a higher margin but it s going to be on that higher revenue so we still feel good about our full year guidance and then of course when we finish our second quarter we generally give an update on our annual guidance at that time and we ll have real good of course at that time we ll know what that second quarter looks like noah merkousko stephens analyst all right thanks that s helpful and i will leave it there alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you noah operator thank you our next question comes from josh wilson with raymond james please proceed josh wilson raymond james analyst thanks and good morning alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning josh wilson raymond james analyst first last quarter you talked about the mix of projects letting maybe being a little biased toward mega projects i think you talked about how that s evolved and what you see that looking like going forward is that normalizing as you had previously thought alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah when we talked about it last quarter we were i think we were talking really more about as it related to the backlog and having not built that up some and as much in the third and fourth quarter so a lot of that was happening in i d say the january through august september period last year and we expected we didn t see a lot of mega projects out in the future so and that s still the case we re not seeing a lot of those large projects out there that eat up a lot of it we are seeing a return more to the more repair and maintenance type projects and there s still some time before that s going to happen real strongly in north carolina that was one where they spent a lot on the mega projects in the early part of 2019 and kind of got a little bit behind with their budgets so but we ve been able to stay busy in our markets by shifting a little bit more to cities and counties and private work those don t generally give you a big backlog boost because those are generally smaller contracts and dots but they keep you very busy but the outlook we see in the next nine to 12 months as far as projects to bid i don t think we ve seen a single mega project in the outlook of dot projects that we ve got coming up in any of our states that i recall josh wilson raymond james analyst got it and then in the december quarter of last year there were some pretty significant weather headwinds anything to note here or is this pretty representative you think of what this quarter s seasonality should look like alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this was a much closer return to normal i think the percentage of our annual revenue in the first quarter is usually somewhere between 20 5 and 21 5 of our annual revenue in this quarter it was 21 of the low end of our guidance so very typical we had a really good start with october and november december due to the christmas and new year s falling in the middle of the week that was more of a disruption than usual and then we had some unfavorable weather in the last half of december so we lost a little momentum there but overall i d say it was a bigger typical first quarter josh wilson raymond james analyst and then last one for me in terms of the gas tax benefits in alabama i think in the past you ve talked about those ramping up in the back half is that still your expectation charles e owens president and chief executive officer definitely we re seeing coming up in february march the cities and counties got projects that they re letting and that s exactly what we expected josh wilson raymond james analyst got it good luck with the next quarter charles e owens president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from bill newby with d a davidson please proceed with your question bill newby d a davidson analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes bill bill newby d a davidson analyst charles i just wanted to touch on alabama quickly i guess are you guys starting to see bidding activity pick up in that market at all now that you have that transportation bill in place i guess if you haven t do you have any line of sight into when that acceleration might begin charles e owens president and chief executive officer yes yes we re seeing the gas tax money being put in place now and we re seeing more projects is related to the gas tax increase so we anticipate that to continue as we go further as you know when you first put something in place you kind of go through a short period of time you need to collect it before you spend it and that s one thing about alabama dot they do a pretty good job in making sure that they don t get too far out go disguise with the projects they let versus the money coming in bill newby d a davidson analyst i guess and then just quickly on the asphalt mix cost are you seeing anything in that market shifting since the beginning of the year i guess i m just wondering with imo 2020 in place are there s any dynamics there that are kind of moving around charles e owens president and chief executive officer no we haven t seen anything that s really made any kind of impact to us at all about it as a matter of fact i think these have fueled down that fairly well low right now and so we just don t anticipate anything that s going to from that impact it s going to have any impact on our business ned n fleming executive chairman bill the asphalt cement prices normally during the winter those will drop and that s what we ve seen this year that s one reason we have the term and we ll try to do a winter field where we store extra material when the price is lower so really any change in the asphalt cement has been more typical of what happens in the winter anyway as opposed to any kind of big reaction to imo 2020 and as charles mentioned and i think we may have talked about on the call before in the prior time if there was any area we were going to expect much impact or much price change it was in the diesel fuel because of what the ships we re going to have to burn and in fact we ve seen diesel cost after probably mid november have just kind of trended down and really had no spike and of course some of that is a lot more related to the price of oil and all that s going on in china but we really have not seen any impact that we would attribute to imo 2020 at this time bill newby d a davidson analyst all right that s great thanks very helpful guys i appreciate it ned n fleming executive chairman yes operator thank you our next question is a follow up from michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys just a quick follow up and apologies if you already addressed this i m just curious on your pipeline with the acquisitions are you seeing an accelerating case of companies willing to discuss with you maybe family businesses looking to try to get in front of the election or election risk there or is it kind of just the same kind of pace of discussions that have played out for you guys the last few quarters thanks charles e owens president and chief executive officer all right thank you michael this is charles we re seeing about the same pace we re obviously the driver to getting these things done is the sellers because this is it s big steps and they want to make sure that they make good decisions and get to employees with good people but as far as i d just say it s kind of a normal pace right now we do having a lot of conversations with a pretty good group of people and obviously we feel very positive for this year for someone like so that s kind of where that stands michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks guys operator thank you it appears there are no further questions at this time so i d like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments charles e owens president and chief executive officer okay i d like to thank everyone for joining the call today and look forward to speaking with you all on the next conference call and we will remain focused on our executing our strategy and i hope everyone has a good week

australia indonesia relations are thriving but economic ties lag behind the just ratified comprehensive economic partnership agreement could change that the visit of indonesia s president joko jokowi widodo to australia this week bodes well for relations with indonesia indeed relations have improved significantly since a low in the earlier part of the last decade marked by diplomatic rows over issues ranging from political gaffes to phone tapping australia and indonesia now enjoy cooperation on a growing number of fronts both countries inked a strategic partnership agreement in august 2018 indonesia now considers australia its preferred partner in the area of security cooperation they co chair a subregional forum on counterterrorism australia has committed significant diplomatic resources to indonesia in 2017 it opened a consulate in surabaya indonesia s second largest city they have also signed a free trade agreement the indonesia australia comprehensive economic partnership agreement ia cepa almost a decade in the making the long awaited deal was ratified by indonesia s legislature this week this is the one area that jokowi and prime minister scott morrison must reconcile with an otherwise booming friendship the state of their economic relations for two neighboring g 20 countries with seemingly complementary economies one would expect higher levels of trade and investment indonesia and australia have the lowest trade volumes of any g 20 pairing in 2018 less than 1 percent of australia s foreign investment went to indonesia two way trade with indonesia has stagnated at around 2 percent for the entire decade it is hard to find a satisfying explanation for this some advocates of increased business ties chalk it up to cultural differences this is difficult to accept given australia s success doing business with other countries in asia such as malaysia australian universities boast a strong community of academics focused on indonesia studies at the grassroots level people to people ties are strong stronger ties between boardrooms are needed to activate investment and diversity the foundation of bilateral trade executives need a narrative of indonesia s opportunities rather than a litany of its risks exchanges of influential business people will pave the way to successful partnerships in this context it s hard to overstate the importance of ia cepa one of the aims of the treaty is to increase investor confidence on both sides the treaty s investor state dispute settlement isds mechanism which establishes a pathway for investors to enforce the protections guaranteed to them under the agreement is a step in the right direction it establishes a system of tariff quotas for the first time australian exporters of key commodities such as live cattle will know how much indonesia will allow in tariff free ia cepa is an achievement but australia indonesia economic ties sit in a wider regional context this fact has sharpened cooperation in other areas and with it a sense that indonesia is on the rise and that it is at the center of a dynamic indo pacific region in which both countries have a huge stake a regional economic agenda is forthcoming their shared participation in the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep understood to be on the path to completion this year will open up new opportunities an ambitious step for indonesia would be accession to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for the trans pacific partnership cptpp indonesia s membership would add considerable economic heft to an agreement currently missing both the united states and china a motivating factor might be that two of indonesia s economic competitors vietnam and malaysia are founding members of the cptpp a widening infrastructure gap constrains economic growth and integration in the region indonesia alone needs billions investment dollars to bridge its own gap meanwhile infrastructure initiatives in the region have emerged as new geopolitical tools to wield influence and snare countries in debt traps the lack of infrastructure is one convincing explanation for why indonesia and australia have low trade ties while both are close neighbors their major populations are far apart and there is little connectivity between the two the areas closest to one another eastern indonesia and northern australia remain relatively underdeveloped northern australia suffers from its own infrastructure gap as policymakers try to incentivize development there northern australia s potential role in enhancing connectivity with indonesia must not be overlooked while australia s foreign policy community has focused on the north as a strategic military asset few have attempted to frame it as a region critical to australia s international connectivity the leaders of both countries should elevate the framing of their economic cooperation to take a regional view by working together shape the region s trade and investment architecture they can diminish the smaller issues that derailed cooperation in the past kyle springer is senior analyst at the perth usasia centre at the university of western australia

the independent read our privacy notice donald trump thought he was having a good week beating impeachment and all but now the meanies at the labor department took a shot at his re election case the deep state s latest jab at the president is friday s yearly revision of estimated job growth under trump the heart of his case that he deserves a second term and the bedrock of the 56 per cent approval of his economic policies it seems that the economy actually created 514 000 fewer jobs by march 2019 than the initial statistics projected so instead of trump presiding over job growth of 7 million since he took office it s actually 6 45 million put in terms the president will understand before the revision he had created 1 1 million fewer jobs than his predecessor barack obama over the three years before trump arrived now it s 1 5 million fewer a 20 per cent drop coupled with impeachment news and trump s bizarro performances thursday at a white house victory event and the national prayer breakfast the revisions overshadow friday s news that the us economy added 225 000 jobs in january beating average forecasts of 164 000 with the unemployment rate rising to 3 6 per cent average hourly wages have risen 3 1 per cent over the last year before inflation according to the labor department inflation was 2 3 per cent in 2019 eroding most income gains put simply pundits routinely debunk trump s claim that he alone created an economic boom and the revisions add to the pundits case there s no boom just a 10 year old economic expansion with a good bit of room to continue and no obvious reason for a recession soon even though growth is slowing recently trump showed up in year eight looking for credit and hoping it will offset his other bad behavior it s not an especially robust expansion under trump or obama but it has lasted long enough to take the us to a reasonably prosperous place if you like it thank those whose policies set it in motion and the workers and entrepreneurs who built it give a special nod to the federal reserve whose loose money policies held the fort against a republican congress that was determined to slash federal spending after the global financial crisis this is different than saying trump has been an economic disaster he hasn t instead the data underscore how little difference he makes clinton vs trump acquittal speech comparison job creation was always going to slow as labor markets edged closer to full employment fewer people are looking for work and with economic growth still modest demand for new workers is moderate the impact trump has had is mostly negative especially recently and especially in the industries he has claimed to help most but it s small his trade policies have been tough on manufacturers who need to sell to export markets and often import parts or raw materials the benchmark revisions an annual adjustment that reconciles data from monthly surveys of employers about hiring with unemployment insurance data from a much larger sample that becomes available months later cut the trump era gain in manufacturing to 471 000 the first three years of obama s second term saw 379 000 new manufacturing jobs but trump has added only about 36 000 manufacturing jobs in the last year on a base of 12 8 million and none since september his tariff policies have gotten in the way of that just as china s market wobbles in 2015 and 2016 hurt us factory jobs in obama s last year look at industries trump says he unleashed the heart of his economic case is that deregulation and tax cuts triggered a boom but deregulation was focused on two industries wall street in a scaling back of the dodd frank law passed after 2008 s financial crisis and energy which benefits in theory from everything from trump s rollback of obama s climate change plans to letting oil and gas companies bid for drilling rights in bear s ears national monument an expanse of red rock southern utah that obama protected by executive order on his way out the door guess what the worst performing sector of the standard poor s 500 index has been over the last three years energy stocks of course thanks to falling energy prices the s p 500 energy index has lost 5 per cent a year even with dividends over the last three years the overall s p including energy is up 15 5 per cent a year even trump is powerless to overcome a flood of new oil supply and flat demand for banks the record is distinctly more meh the keefe bruyette woods bank index gave back nearly all of its post election gains in 2018 as protectionism fears begat recession fears it s been rising since october but financials lag the market still the post election rally was a bet on deregulation but also a bet that higher interest rates would boost profits the president has pressured the fed to cut rates instead arguing the economy is too weak for normal rates there s no trump boom there s not even a boom voters know this even trump does hence his campaigning for rate cuts in 2018 the last six polls before the election gave trump a 10 net approval rating on the economy and his party lost 40 house seats then and now polling on the direction of the country points in the other direction by 17 points voters think america s on the wrong track trump s argument to the contrary turns on the idea he reversed economic decline and news like today s underscores how hard that argument is

charles charles e owens president and chief executive officer thank you rick and good morning everyone with me on the call today are ned fleming our executive chairman and alan palmer our chief financial officer i will start today by providing an update on our first quarter and i will then turn the call over the ned for few additional comments finally alan will review our financial results before we take your questions we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter that produced double digit year over year growth in revenue gross profit and adjusted ebitda this growth was driven both by improved performance in our existing markets and by recent strategic acquisitions in florida and alabama the first half of our fiscal year historically produces approximately 40 of our annual revenue based on the seasonality of our business and these first quarter results are in line with our expectations we continue to see sustained demand across our 33 distinct markets for road repair and maintenance work we also see sustained competition in this business we are competing every day for work our team is focused on reducing costs and maximizing efficiencies throughout our organization and construction project work to achieve profitable growth it is important to point out that the flexibility of our model provides opportunities to pursue projects that will allow us to enhance the utilization of our workforce and equipment we continue to pursue projects both public and private that all possess the best opportunity to grow profitability i know the key aspect of our business is our geographic diversity operating across 33 separate markets in multiple states we have exposure to different local economic environments on the private side and on the public side we have five different state dots and a large number of other public entities that we can work with throughout these markets this diversity allows us to bid on both public and private projects to maximize our vertically integrated business model turning to our recent acquisitions we have fully integrated the acquisition we made in october which is a hot mix asphalt plant and paving company in high growth area of the florida east coast we have now successfully completed five acquisitions since our ipo in may 2018 and a total of 20 acquisitions since founding the business in 2001 we are pleased with the performance of the operations we acquired in florida and alabama we continue to see growth opportunities in those markets in florida in particular where we now have a broader footprint in the eastern side of the state we expect these markets to benefit from the close proximity and enhanced vertical integration with our diverse equipment fleet and workforce capable of forming a broad range of services we believe they are meaningful opportunities to add scale drive growth and provide value for our customers as we progress through fiscal 2020 we will continue to consistently execute the strategy of controlled profitable growth utilizing three primary levers by doing more work in our core market by making strategic acquisitions and by expanding through green field opportunities we continue to have active conversations with potential acquisition candidates we also remain patient with acquisition opportunities and evaluate prospects that best fit our strategy before turning the call over to ned i would like to thank our senior management team for their leadership and i would also like to thank our more than 2 200 employees for their dedication and hard work that enable us to execute our strategy now i ll turn the call over to ned fleming our executive chairman for a few additional comments ned ned n fleming executive chairman thank you charles and good morning to everyone the team delivered an excellent first quarter as charles and alan have expressed many times this is a seasonal business that ramps up throughout the year and expands from both a top line and a profitability standpoint during the second half of the year so as we evaluate our first quarter results and look at the opportunities to come throughout the year with a combination of projected company growth and a number of potential acquisition candidates in markets of interest to us we are truly excited about our future quite simply the positive supply and demand dynamics of our business have remained pretty much the same since we started the cpi in 2001 roads are deteriorating and local state and federal government plans are being used to prepare them in fact i might argue that those dynamics are even better today because the deteriorating road conditions across the country have not improved and in most places have worsened and more and more states are taking ownership by implementing gas taxes to help maintain and improve roadways in their states which is exactly what has happened in all the states we operate in as charles mentioned we have a flexible model enabling the team to work on private or public projects across the 33 unique mini economies in which we compete some of our markets are experiencing good economic growth right now others have less growth and others might be down or slightly flat however our broad geographic diversity brings stability and consistency to the company also we have the flexibility to move equipment and crews and the ability to do different size in all type projects which further differentiates us from many of our competitors over the last 20 years our business model has shown resilience and consistency in different economic and competitive environments the team is committed to continually improving business processes to grow revenues and margins the opportunities today to utilize technology integrate more efficient processes benefit from a more flexible organization to drive efficiency are terrific as the entire cpi teams continue to execute at a high level led by seasoned and experienced operators across the organization we plan to continue to deliver strong results consistent with our strategy for achieving controlled profitable growth throughout the year we plan to continue to tell our story to investors which we believe provides a very compelling investment thesis the team continues to work hard to enhance financial results cash generation and maximize value for our shareholders as well as all the stakeholders and with that i d like to turn the call over to our cfo alan palmer alan alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you ned and good morning everyone i want to start by quickly highlighting our key performance metrics in the first quarter from a financial standpoint as charles mentioned year over year growth in the first quarter was driven by improved performance in our existing markets and by the recent strategic acquisitions in florida and alabama revenue for the quarter increased to 175 3 million up 21 million over the same quarter last year organic revenue growth was approximately 7 9 million and acquisitive revenue growth was approximately 13 1 million attributable to acquisitions completed subsequent to the quarter ended december 31 2018 gross profit increased to 23 8 million up approximately 2 6 million over the same period last year primarily due to higher revenue and higher margin net income was 5 5 million up from 5 2 million compared to the same quarter last year earnings per share were 0 11 compared to 0 10 per share last year note that interest expense declined approximately 235 000 compared to the same quarter last year due to a decrease in the average interest rate as a result of amending our credit agreement in june 2019 our effective tax rate was 19 5 compared to 24 3 for the same period last year the lower effective tax rate was due to a discrete tax reduction of 363 000 in the quarter related to an amended state income tax return we expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year to be approximately 25 2 adjusted ebitda increased approximately 2 5 million to 17 2 million resulting in an adjusted ebitda margin of 9 8 compared to 9 5 in the first quarter last year the higher adjusted ebitda was a combination of higher gross profit and depreciation depletion and amortization partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were 17 1 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to last year of 14 4 million the 2 7 million increase was primarily the result of a 1 4 million increase in management personnel payroll and benefits of 797 000 increase attributable to acquisitions completed subsequent to december 31 2018 and then 395 000 increase in stock compensation expense turning now to the balance sheet at december 31 2019 we had 49 4 million of cash and 13 6 million of availability under our 30 million revolving credit facility after deducting outstanding letters of credit our debt to trailing 12 months ebitda ratio was less than 1 time at 0 73 we have a very strong balance sheet to support our growth opportunities cash provided by operating activities was 1 5 million for the three months ended december 31 2019 compared to 1 2 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 capex in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 23 6 million excluding approximately 11 5 million to purchase certain equipment that was previously subject to operating leases our capex was 12 1 million in the first quarter compared to 7 4 million in the same quarter last year for fiscal 2020 we expect our capital expenditures to be in the range of 44 million to 47 million excluding the 11 5 million purchase of equipment that was previously subject to operating leases project backlog at december 31 2019 was 539 1 million compared to 531 6 million at september 30 2019 and 572 million at december 31 2018 of our current 539 million in backlog approximately 75 or 403 million is expected to be completed during the remainder of our fiscal year we maintain a construction backlog composed primarily of recurring maintenance related projects of the type that we prefer and we continue to see opportunities to bid on these projects in our markets keep in mind that we focus on our backlog in 33 distinct markets meaning we want to have six to nine months of backlog in our markets as these market specific backlogs are aggregated for our companywide backlog while the overall amount can fluctuate quarter over quarter based on several large projects either being added or completed we focus on the overall health of backlog in terms of the next 12 months in each specific market we also maintain a disciplined approach to strategically focus on recurring repair and maintenance projects historically our backlog builds during our second and third quarters as more of these projects are typically let in february through may we are maintaining our full year outlook for fiscal 2020 based on our historical experience of generating approximately 40 of our revenue in the first half of the fiscal year and approximately 60 during the second half our fiscal year 2020 outlook with regard to revenue net income and adjusted ebitda are as follows revenue of 830 million to 870 million compared to 783 2 million in fiscal year 2019 net income of 39 million to 44 million compared to 43 1 million in fiscal year 2019 and adjusted ebitda of 94 million to 102 million compared to 92 3 million in fiscal year 2019 in summary we are pleased with our first quarter results and we continue to see positive market trends and project demand in fiscal 2020 with that we ll now take questions operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting the question and answer session our first question comes from the line of michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed okay and we will move on to our next question which comes from the line of adam thalhimer with thompson davis please proceed with your question adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst hey good morning guys nice quarter alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning thank you adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst so can you give us a little more color on you said you d like to have six to nine months of backlog in your specific markets can you give us a little more color on how you re how you guys view the current level of backlog alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer considering the time of the year we re pleased with it we do expect with the projects that we ve got available coming up in the next few months and what we ve already seen as far as our bid results in january for that to build like it typically would going into the second the end of the second quarter and then there will not be as much build in the third and fourth because we do so much of our revenue but we see a lot of good opportunities out in front of us in many of our markets to be able to build that backlog some more adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst and then curious on the seasonality of ebitda last couple of years ebitda has declined from december to march before it picked up in the back half is that would you expect a similar trend this year alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes as generally our volume in our second quarter which is january through march is the lowest volume of the year so a lot of the fixed cost that we incur in january especially in repairs of plants and equipment and the slowdown they impact that margin our job margins are fairly consistent throughout the year but the plants and equipment accounts are the ones where we have a lot of fixed costs that we ll incur in that quarter with a lot lower revenue so that s usually our lowest gross profit core adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst okay thank you alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question mr feniger your line is live michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah can you hear me alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes good morning mike michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah sorry yeah good morning sorry about that i think i might have i apologize i think i m sorry if i make you guys repeat your question here with maybe we could just touch on the sg a i think it was pretty high as a percent of sales i know there is a seasonal impact with the lower revenue and maybe you just touched on this with the question prior but is there anything we should be aware of with costs from new acquisitions or something that was running a little bit higher in the first quarter and how that might trend through the rest of the year alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah in the first quarter we had about 800 000 of g a that was related to acquisitions that we didn t have in the same quarter last year so quarter over quarter this year to last year that was part of that we also had some about 400 000 of non cash equity related to the directors last year chose to take their directors compensation in stock instead of cash and so that was a non cash that we did not have in the same quarter last year then the other was just primarily increase in staff that we ve added in the administrative level we also have some expenses in our first quarter that occur in that quarter for safety awards and other type of employee costs that generally are they re paid prior to in december prior to the end of our first quarter so that kind of bump up that first quarter that amount should trend down in the second third and fourth absent any additional acquisitions so the run rate in for overhead in this first quarter should be the highest for the year michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and then i m just curious like the fast act authorization i think expires in september of this year look i think you guys have been in this industry a long time you ve seen this before i m just curious if you could flag to us how we should see the markets evolving how dot budgets kind of evolve as we approach september if any changes at all charles e owens president and chief executive officer hi this is charles we really don t see any major impact at all just kind of almost become a standard for these things to expire and then they get funded through our crs until so we really don t anticipate any slowdown we still got a lot of tailwind in our back with a lot of the states that s gas tax is have kicked in and they continue to kick in and obviously we don t have anything in our model based on anything new but we re just think it s going to be business as usual alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we are the state of the union address and then the rebuttal by the democratic party and i think their first comment was about infrastructure bill so there s certainly a consensus across all the political spectrum to get something done and we are hopeful that that might get done before the fast act expires but as charles said if it doesn t continuing resolutions are a normal part of it and the dots have gotten very accustomed to that in the last 10 years michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst that makes sense and if i could just squeeze one on the private side i mean i know we re talking a lot about the public side just are you guys observing anything in your districts on the private side that suggests alarm there has been some concerns on the non resi construction side in some areas in some states i am just curious if you guys are observing any of that in your book of business charles e owens president and chief executive officer in a private side we re still seeing a lot of commercial and we re still seeing a little bit of residential that s kind of been normal but that s a business that we don t chase too hard is that once related strictly to the residential developments because a little bit of their cyclicality but in the markets that we re in we re still seeing a very strong economy we re still seeing a lot of work being let and so far the markets that we re in we are very positive that that is going to be a continuation for the next several months michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst fair enough operator thank you we ll move on to our next question which comes from andrew wittmann with robert w baird please proceed andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst great thanks good morning guys i guess my first question is probably here for alan and i just wanted to talk about the capex number you guys called out last quarter very clearly that you d have this kind of operating lease buyout alan i was hoping you could just give us just give all the investors here a little bit of a flavor of the types of things that were involved in those leases and if you could it would be very helpful for you to quantify the amount of lease expense or rent expense on those operating leases that was previously expense that s now going to turn into depreciation on a go forward basis alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer okay the amount that we bought out in october was 11 5 million this is a fair market value of those leases so and from a depreciation standpoint that would equate to approximately 2 million a year i don t have an exact lease expense amount but it probably would be 2 5 million i would say but i can get that exact number because we did our analysis of whether to buy it out but so that and that was for us that was figured into our 2020 budget because we knew we were going to do those because those leases were going to go on our books one way or the other as a capital asset and we also if you when you look at the balance sheet you will see that we booked about another 8 5 million worth of the value of operating lease assets because we became subject to the new lease standards october 1 but to the first part of the question all of that would have been equipment related that we bought out so those would have been operating leases for bulldozers rollers trucks there were a good number of dump trucks that we had leased and then some other heavy equipment so that s the type of things that we had on operating leases we still have some of that but we have a number of locations that we lease properties that our asphalt plants are sitting on whether it d be in a quarry or just outside of a quarry and so that is the majority of what is in that operating right of use asset so there are some additional yellow iron but not a lot andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst that s helpful color thank you for that and just kind of another aspect here of the cash flow here is it calculated here the dsos are up decent number of days sequentially and i was just wondering if you could kind of give some of the mechanics behind that certainly the fact that you did an acquisition in the quarter you don t get all the revenue in that quarter from that acquisition but you do book all the receivables i have to imagine that s part of it but i don t know if you could help just understand what s going on here because last quarter there was a lot of discussion about how there are some state dots that were paying you kind of slow and you saw the catch up on that and so i just thought it d be helpful for everyone to hear a little bit about the status of some of those receivables that you ve talked about last quarter and have it relate back here to the dso calculation alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and we do expect to for that to have the delays from the dot to have less impact as we go through the year unfortunately the first quarter december specifically there are a lot of holidays and while our accounts payable people weren t taking off we kept paying our bills a lot of the customers took advantage of the holidays and said they d pay us in january so from a past due standpoint which is really what we look at we are still in good shape there we have very few write offs of receivables and certainly not on the public side but the delay in collecting some of them is still it s still real but it should not increase and we do feel like we can get back a little bit more on track in the second quarter because we won t have the holidays where they take off for the last week or two which is when we often get paid from the dots andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst okay that s helpful and then i guess just my last question here it has to do with the comments from the prepared remarks you kind of mentioned that you see continued state growth but there s also sustained competition charles i was wondering if you could just expand upon that a little bit are you seeing is the competition pricing any differently or going about their business any differently are you referring to anything specifically that you saw here during the quarter or new entrants things of that i just thought maybe kind of expanding upon that commentary on the competition would be helpful charles e owens president and chief executive officer from a competitive standpoint obviously this business is a very competitive business and it s always been but as far as anything that we see any different that we normally haven t seen it s we re not seeing anything that i guess the point i brought up was that every job we get that is normally on a competitive basis and that s one reason that we have to work so hard to improve our efficiencies and really understand our markets so we can maximize our profitability andrew wittmann robert w baird analyst okay good i ll leave it there thank you very much charles e owens president and chief executive officer thank you andy operator thank you our next question is from trey grooms with stephens please proceed noah merkousko stephens analyst hi this is actually noah merkousko on for trey alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer hey good morning noah merkousko stephens analyst good morning so my first question it looks like the adjusted ebitda margin was up about 30 bps but it came in a little bit lower than we were expecting is this in line with your expectations and maybe was there anything in the quarter that pressured the margins more than you had originally thought alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer it was very much in line with our expectations as far as what we expected we our jobs performed at a very good level in the quarter we had enough volume going through the plants and the equipment that they were in line actually the plants were slightly better and the equipment just slightly more cost than we had so overall those were in line we were pleased with our external sales that contribute to that and the performance of the liquid asphalt terminal so we were actually at the gross profit line we were a little bit higher than what we anticipated on that revenue and then i ve talked a little bit about the g a that was a little bit higher than what our expectation was but again part of that is due to those costs that come in in that fourth quarter that when we re budgeting they re more equal throughout the year so and then we had about almost 700 000 800 000 i think it was of acquisition cost in the quarter so but overall the overall margin was just maybe 10 basis points above what we expected noah merkousko stephens analyst okay that s helpful and then just to follow up on that your guide implies an ebitda margin of 11 5 how should we think about that ramping up last year i think the back half saw that margin 4 to 5 higher is that would that be a good assumption to use for this year alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that should be pretty much in line the second quarter historically is going to be the lowest margin if we follow the typical and then that third and fourth quarter is when it s generally going to be 4 5 higher and then you average out to that 11 because you re going to do about 60 of your work in that quarter so it s not only going to be a higher margin but it s going to be on that higher revenue so we still feel good about our full year guidance and then of course when we finish our second quarter we generally give an update on our annual guidance at that time and we ll have real good of course at that time we ll know what that second quarter looks like noah merkousko stephens analyst all right thanks that s helpful and i will leave it there alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you noah operator thank you our next question comes from josh wilson with raymond james please proceed josh wilson raymond james analyst thanks and good morning alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning josh wilson raymond james analyst first last quarter you talked about the mix of projects letting maybe being a little biased toward mega projects i think you talked about how that s evolved and what you see that looking like going forward is that normalizing as you had previously thought alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah when we talked about it last quarter we were i think we were talking really more about as it related to the backlog and having not built that up some and as much in the third and fourth quarter so a lot of that was happening in i d say the january through august september period last year and we expected we didn t see a lot of mega projects out in the future so and that s still the case we re not seeing a lot of those large projects out there that eat up a lot of it we are seeing a return more to the more repair and maintenance type projects and there s still some time before that s going to happen real strongly in north carolina that was one where they spent a lot on the mega projects in the early part of 2019 and kind of got a little bit behind with their budgets so but we ve been able to stay busy in our markets by shifting a little bit more to cities and counties and private work those don t generally give you a big backlog boost because those are generally smaller contracts and dots but they keep you very busy but the outlook we see in the next nine to 12 months as far as projects to bid i don t think we ve seen a single mega project in the outlook of dot projects that we ve got coming up in any of our states that i recall josh wilson raymond james analyst got it and then in the december quarter of last year there were some pretty significant weather headwinds anything to note here or is this pretty representative you think of what this quarter s seasonality should look like alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this was a much closer return to normal i think the percentage of our annual revenue in the first quarter is usually somewhere between 20 5 and 21 5 of our annual revenue in this quarter it was 21 of the low end of our guidance so very typical we had a really good start with october and november december due to the christmas and new year s falling in the middle of the week that was more of a disruption than usual and then we had some unfavorable weather in the last half of december so we lost a little momentum there but overall i d say it was a bigger typical first quarter josh wilson raymond james analyst and then last one for me in terms of the gas tax benefits in alabama i think in the past you ve talked about those ramping up in the back half is that still your expectation charles e owens president and chief executive officer definitely we re seeing coming up in february march the cities and counties got projects that they re letting and that s exactly what we expected josh wilson raymond james analyst got it good luck with the next quarter charles e owens president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from bill newby with d a davidson please proceed with your question bill newby d a davidson analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions alan palmer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes bill bill newby d a davidson analyst charles i just wanted to touch on alabama quickly i guess are you guys starting to see bidding activity pick up in that market at all now that you have that transportation bill in place i guess if you haven t do you have any line of sight into when that acceleration might begin charles e owens president and chief executive officer yes yes we re seeing the gas tax money being put in place now and we re seeing more projects is related to the gas tax increase so we anticipate that to continue as we go further as you know when you first put something in place you kind of go through a short period of time you need to collect it before you spend it and that s one thing about alabama dot they do a pretty good job in making sure that they don t get too far out go disguise with the projects they let versus the money coming in bill newby d a davidson analyst i guess and then just quickly on the asphalt mix cost are you seeing anything in that market shifting since the beginning of the year i guess i m just wondering with imo 2020 in place are there s any dynamics there that are kind of moving around charles e owens president and chief executive officer no we haven t seen anything that s really made any kind of impact to us at all about it as a matter of fact i think these have fueled down that fairly well low right now and so we just don t anticipate anything that s going to from that impact it s going to have any impact on our business ned n fleming executive chairman bill the asphalt cement prices normally during the winter those will drop and that s what we ve seen this year that s one reason we have the term and we ll try to do a winter field where we store extra material when the price is lower so really any change in the asphalt cement has been more typical of what happens in the winter anyway as opposed to any kind of big reaction to imo 2020 and as charles mentioned and i think we may have talked about on the call before in the prior time if there was any area we were going to expect much impact or much price change it was in the diesel fuel because of what the ships we re going to have to burn and in fact we ve seen diesel cost after probably mid november have just kind of trended down and really had no spike and of course some of that is a lot more related to the price of oil and all that s going on in china but we really have not seen any impact that we would attribute to imo 2020 at this time bill newby d a davidson analyst all right that s great thanks very helpful guys i appreciate it ned n fleming executive chairman yes operator thank you our next question is a follow up from michael feniger with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys just a quick follow up and apologies if you already addressed this i m just curious on your pipeline with the acquisitions are you seeing an accelerating case of companies willing to discuss with you maybe family businesses looking to try to get in front of the election or election risk there or is it kind of just the same kind of pace of discussions that have played out for you guys the last few quarters thanks charles e owens president and chief executive officer all right thank you michael this is charles we re seeing about the same pace we re obviously the driver to getting these things done is the sellers because this is it s big steps and they want to make sure that they make good decisions and get to employees with good people but as far as i d just say it s kind of a normal pace right now we do having a lot of conversations with a pretty good group of people and obviously we feel very positive for this year for someone like so that s kind of where that stands michael feniger bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thanks guys operator thank you it appears there are no further questions at this time so i d like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments charles e owens president and chief executive officer okay i d like to thank

after the death of hugo chavez nicolas maduro was elected in april 2013 during his first term in power the economy worsened his socialist government was to be blamed for the country s decline mismanagement and corruption despite his efforts to promote chavez vision of venezuela to reduce inequality through implementing important measures like price controls to make basic goods more affordable to the poor he forced many venezuelan businesses to halt production because they no longer made a profit this resulted in various shortages in the country by 2019 inflation was almost 10 million food and medicine were running out and millions of venezuelans were fleeing the country today guaidรณ a 35 year old politician is recognized as the interim president of venezuela by most western countries putting maduro s government in real danger categorized by the washington post as an accidental leader who assumed his party s mantle at the moment when it suddenly mattered and when venezuela the oil rich country on the verge of collapse has been a priority for president trump president maduro didn t accept this sudden move pressing on the fact that he is still the constitutional president for the second six year term in office and despite attempts by guaidรณ to gain the military allegiance to him the armed forces have remained loyal to maduro whose socialist party has also got a firm grip on the electoral body and the supreme court with the us sanctions the maduro socialist government has become pragmatic it was obliged to loosen the economic restraints on taxation boosting in the private exports of everything from oil to chocolate elite businesses were booming especially those politically connected imports by private companies overtook those done by the state for the first time in venezuela s modern history half a dozen of venezuela banks have begun accumulating millions of dollars and euros in cash according to reuters this cash came mainly from remittances by the millions of venezuelans who have left in recent years those who have family abroad can now receive and spend their dollar on imported food also from the opec member s oil and gold sales to allied nations like russia since trump s administration issued the economic sanctions on venezuela russia jumped into the spotlight with oil deals with the south american nation worth of billions it is chartering vessels from third parties and hiding the origin of the crude as it is marketed around the world free from sanctions russia is now the second largest supplier of crude oil to american refineries dollars are used in many daily transactions in venezuela deserted shopping malls are busy again new restaurants and bars are opening weekly in the wealthier parts of town their tables are packed with foreign businessmen stocked shelves in the supermarkets has also helped ease tensions in the capital but the boom has also come at a cost in the poor cities there is still water and electricity shortages malnutrition and lacking basic services a ticket to a recent music festival in caracas did cost 70 a 14 months worth of minimum salary the new free market economy left half of venezuelans without access to dollars maduro considers the process of dollarization a good thing to happen but the special us representative to venezuela elliott abrams said recently that the steps that maduro is taking to sustain the economy under the embargo by dollarizing it is treason against chavismo the sanctions are really working
as the cityscape develops rapidly a woman and her daughter collect cowdung for fuel in their ongoing campaign against rising global inequality the international ngo oxfam has recently published a series of shocking statistics documenting the growing gap between the rich and the poor worldwide with the massive burden of unpaid care work being shouldered by women particularly from the global south the report provides a series of disturbing statistics about the rapidly increasing wealth gap between the world s wealthiest and the poorest it tells us that the world s richest 1 per cent have more than twice as much wealth as 6 9 billion people contrast this with the fact that almost half of the world s population lives on less than 5 50 a day a major reason for this is the wealthiest class s ability to exert an inordinate influence over their respective governments thus avoiding fulfilling their social responsibility to give back a part of their wealth in the form of taxes oxfam s report tells us for example that only 4 cents in every dollar revenue comes from taxes on wealth this is also because the wealthy are able to hide much of their wealth by avoiding their tax responsibilities 30 per cent of their tax liability to be precise the report also delineates that the effects of this inequality are unevenly felt even amongst the poor with women and girls suffering its consequences the most for example for every 100 boys out of primary school 121 girls suffer the same fate furthermore much of the work performed by women globally is unpaid which means women s ability to move out of the poverty trap is further hindered oxfam s report tells us that the estimated value of women s unpaid labour is 10 8 trillion a year three times the size of the tech industry for many of us reading such statistics has become so common that we are almost numb to their implications for example how does one wrap one s head around the fact that 22 of the richest men in the world own as much wealth as all of the women in africa the numbers are so staggering as to become almost impossible to grasp furthermore until we talk more concretely about how or whether these growing inequalities are being experienced in our contexts such statistics remain within the realm of distant and abstract figures is inequality a problem in pakistan there is a great deal of confusion about the nature and extent of inequality in pakistan part of this is due to a lack of comprehensive administrative data on income and wealth according to the world bank the gini coefficient which measures the rate of income inequality in a country rose by 1 per cent between 2001 and 2015 which demonstrates a slight widening of the gap between the rich and the poor in the country data shows that the top 10 per cent of the population consumes on average three times more than the bottom 10 per cent and their incomes are five times as large given the skyrocketing rate of inflation in the country as a result of the imf s latest austerity programme one can deduce that the rate of inequality would have worsened even more over the past year under the imf s austerity measures inflation has reached an all time high in pakistan with the costs being overwhelmingly shouldered by the poor as of january 2020 inflation stood at 14 6 per cent the highest it has been in nine years the cost of basic foodstuffs has been particularly high which hits the poor the hardest in the last year alone the cost of tomatoes rose 157 72 per cent onions 125 32 per cent vegetables 93 6 per cent potatoes 87 3 per cent sugar 26 29 per cent wheat flour 24 06 per cent eggs 18 05 per cent cooking oil 15 44 per cent and meat 13 43 per cent it is a wonder how the poor are able to put food on their tables given such staggering increases inequality is seen globally through a gendered lens it should also be approached as such in pakistan with only 26 per cent of pakistani women engaged in paid labour the vast majority of women are dependent on their husbands or male relatives for their material well being most often male earnings are shared unevenly within the household which means that amongst poor households the female members are doubly disadvantaged even when women are earning their own incomes they are not paid at the same rate as men for the same work the gender pay gap in pakistan is reported to be 34 per cent which is more than twice the global average and is reportedly the highest in the world furthermore the effects of cutting spending on social services such as health and education are borne inordinately by women for example one can guess that the introduction of higher fees for various medical tests in punjab s public hospitals and the termination of free diagnostic care in indoor departments will mean both that women and girls are at risk of being denied medical treatment by already struggling families and that the increased burden of care work for sick patients will be carried by women in their homes why is inequality a problem growing inequality is not only an ethical problem inequality has very real detrimental social consequences in terms of health studies have found that the higher the rate of inequality the higher the rates of various health problems including obesity and mental illness in the context of pakistan there has been a shocking increase in suicide rates in some of the most deprived parts of the country with women and youth amongst those most affected for example 1 300 cases of suicide have been recorded in sindh over the past five years in 2018 81 per cent of those committing suicide belonged to the lower income groups with most suicides blamed on poverty unemployment ignorance economic conditions lack of basic facilities of life debt forced marriages violence and drug abuse in cities too poverty has reached crippling levels a few days ago a 45 year old man committed suicide by setting himself on fire in orangi town karachi following a similar incident last month when a father of four took his own life because he was unable to provide for his family rising inequality has also been linked to decreasing social cohesion and an increase in violence of all forms numerous studies have demonstrated a link between inequality and an increase in various forms of conflict from the household to locality and even the national level this creates a vicious cycle with poverty leading to increased conflict and conflict leading to more spending on security rather than social welfare for example according to government estimates the cost of acts of terrorism to the national exchequer between 2001 and 2017 is estimated to be 123 13 billion according to the 2016 2017 pakistan economic survey last year the government gave away rs 20 billion in tax relief to the wealthiest class which was 40 per cent of the amount of tax it would collect from middle classes the largest banking cement car manufacturing textile fertilizer and food companies were the main beneficiaries of these cuts and the owners of these corporations were amongst the wealthiest individuals in the country furthermore inequalities in terms of development between different parts of the country lead to increasing tensions between ethnic groups and a sense of alienation amongst those who are most deprived while poverty is a national problem it is spread unevenly across the country a staggering 62 per cent of balochistan s rural population is living in poverty and 80 per cent of the poor overall live in rural areas leading to a rapid rate of urbanization and an increasing strain on the resources and infrastructure of our cities such spatial disparities have serious political and social impacts and pose the greatest threats to the peace and stability of the country overall regional disparities lead to an increase in resentment amongst those who are sidelined by development if we are attentive to the follies of the past it was the unequal distribution of wealth between east and west pakistan that eventually led to the bloody schism between the two in 1971 what can be done while there is no simple solution to the problem of growing inequality one of the most effective means of reducing the wealth gap is through a more progressive tax structure one in which the wealthiest citizens contribute the most to the country s exchequer a study of inequality in the united states over the last 50 years found that the periods in which taxes were most progressive corresponded with those in which income inequality was the lowest currently the tax structure in most countries is heavily skewed towards privileging the wealthy according to oxfam one of the reasons inequality is growing at such an exponential rate is because governments tend to undertax corporations and wealthy individuals under the guide of protecting business and ensuring growth in actuality this allows wealth to be concentrated in the hands of the wealthy and prevents re distribution amongst the rest of the population in our own context we have seen the pti government provide rs 20 billion in tax relief to the wealthiest class last year which was 40 per cent of the amount of tax it would collect from the middle classes the largest banking cement car manufacturing textile fertilizer and food companies were the main beneficiaries of these cuts and the owners of these corporations were amongst the wealthiest individuals in the country even the imf which is generally conservative in terms of its policy recommendations advises countries to increase social spending in order to decrease the harmful impacts of income inequality in particular they recommend reducing defence spending and reallocating those funds to social protection pakistan has one of the lowest ratios of spending on social services with less than 5 per cent being spent on health and education if one compares this to the relative size of the military budget which it is estimated absorbs roughly 20 per cent of the annual budget and keeps wealth concentrated in the hands of a privileged class within the military the imbalance in priorities becomes even starker apart from specific policy changes tackling inequality at its root would mean shifting our national approach to poverty alleviation and development more generally the dominant approach in the current and previous governments has focused on a model premised on charity in order to deal with the problem of poverty this is evidenced by the benazir bhutto income support programme which provides small cash transfers to women and by the expanded ehsaas programme of the current government which focuses on such measures as soup kitchens and scholarships for the poor while such programmes provide much needed safety nets for the poor they do not challenge the structural reasons poverty exists in the first place and arguably keep the poor in a perpetual state of dependence and marginality rather than responding to poverty with charity the state should approach poverty as an issue of social justice and as a failure of the system overall furthermore the current growth driven model of development is not only unsustainable from an environmental perspective it also does not deal with the question of distribution and equity in order to reverse the process of growing inequality at national and global levels governments including our own will have to shift their priorities away from growth and towards a model premised on social justice fairness and sustainability finally none of this can happen without a robust and functioning democratic process which as we know has come under increasing attack in recent years in our context if governments respond to the needs of the wealthiest at the expense of the vast majority the income gap and all of the problems that come along with it will continue to grow the autor is an associate professor of sociology at lums and

warren and sanders are the candidates with arguably the most aggressive plans to tax the rich it s hardly surprising that if a democrat wins the white house taxes on wealthy americans and corporations will probably go up how they ll go up is the more interesting question the 2020 democratic presidential candidates generally agree the u s economy faces a variety of challenges record high income inequality decaying infrastructure failing public schools climate change that is already leading to fires and floods and a lack of health insurance for millions of americans to name a few to remedy these problems every candidate has proposed raising government revenue by increasing taxes on the rich in one way or another whether through higher income tax rates a wealth tax or changing how investment income is treated here is a brief look at the tax plans of the top eight candidates in the polls all of whom will be in the feb 7 democratic debate except billionaire michael bloomberg and what economists like me think about them individual income taxes president donald trump s 2017 tax reform law reduced the top individual income tax rate from 39 6 to 37 every democratic candidate running to replace trump agrees that it should be raised most suggest returning it to 39 6 a few think it should go higher bloomberg proposes an additional 5 surcharge on income above us 5 million yielding a 44 6 rate while vermont sen bernie sanders wants a top rate of 52 for taxes on lower and middle income americans the candidates generally say they plan to leave the current rates in place or lower them the candidates focus on taxing the wealthy because they say the richest americans have benefited greatly from u s tax policy in the recent past and are no longer paying their fair share the question that economists ask when assessing such policies is when do high tax rates have negative economic consequences such as by discouraging productive work because uncle sam takes such a big chunk of each extra dollar they earn the standard economic argument for lower marginal tax rates is that it provides incentives for people to work hard and be productive but it s not clear at what rate that happens and 37 does not seem to be the tipping point for perspective every year from 1940 to 1980 the top marginal tax rate was at least 70 yet productivity growth and economic growth were both robust over this period investment income a related issue is should investment income such as dividends capital gains and carried interest be taxed at a lower rate than labor income currently investment income is taxed at a top rate of 20 as opposed to the 37 tax on labor income with other rate differentials at lower incomes the democratic candidates all want to end the practice of taxing investment income at a lower rate than labor income i believe there are good reasons to do so as do many other economists primarily a lower tax rate incentivizes the wealthy to find ways to convert earnings from labor into capital income to reduce their tax bill and believe it or not private equity managers who typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year have all their earnings classified as capital income cutting their tax bill in half corporate income tax the 2017 trump tax bill also cut corporate taxes from 35 to 21 with proponents arguing it would spur business investment and economic growth several studies however found little or no evidence of this impact and the 2017 tax bill reduced corporate tax revenues as a share of gdp to 1 1 from the 50 year average of 1 9 putting a larger proportion of the tax burden on individuals this is why all the democratic candidates propose raising corporate tax rates some such as former vice president joe biden and minnesota sen amy klobuchar want to raise the rate some while others such as mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren would restore the pre trump 35 rate similar to the individual tax finding the optimal corporate tax rate can be tricky generally speaking changes to corporate taxes have little impact on the u s economy so raising them shouldn t slow growth higher corporate taxes do however reduce stock prices since corporations will pay more money to the government and less to shareholders as dividends thereby reducing incentives to own stock shares this can hurt less wealthy americans with investments in retirement plans and mutual funds a wealth tax sens sanders and warren argue the super wealthy should pay even higher taxes to reduce inequality and to cover their bigger spending plans most americans agree warren wants to slap a 2 tax on net worth in excess of 50 million and a 3 tax on fortunes in excess of 1 billion sanders would go further he suggests a tax of 1 on net worth over 32 million that would get progressively higher rising to 8 on wealth over 10 billion economists are not huge wealth tax fans they think it would spark tax evasion and for this reason not likely lead to much additional revenue more than that a wealth tax may be unconstitutional even if congress were to pass such a tax it would immediately be challenged in the courts the supreme court would likely hold it unconstitutional as was the case with the individual income tax which required the 16th amendment to the u s constitution be passed before it could be implemented carbon tax carbon taxes are taxes on polluting activities such as the use of gasoline or electricity economists across the political spectrum tend to support taxing carbon because it creates incentives for consumers and businesses to spend money in ways that reduce carbon emissions and slow climate change it would however increase the cost of driving flying and heating one s home it would also increase the price of all goods transported long distances and whose production requires a good deal of energy this regressive side to the tax is why sanders doesn t support carbon taxes though most of the other candidates do as an example yang s 40 per ton tax would cost the average american family 2 000 a year besides helping the environment the entrepreneur says a carbon tax would help finance his basic income guarantee turning the page with few exceptions the democrats running for president seem to be on the same basic tax policy page they all want to raise more revenue by taxing capital income at the same rate as labor income and increasing rates on the wealthy and on corporations they differ over the extra taxes like on carbon wealth and financial transactions whatever combination of these tax changes might be enacted if a democrat wins the white house in 2020 and congress is controlled by the democrats the rich will almost certainly lose their large gains under

why we need bernie coyote culture follow 12 min read jan 16 2020 listen share the moment you ve all been waiting for coyote culture endorses sanders for president bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez the latter of whom endorsed the former last october by the cc editorial team earlier this week senator bernard sanders of vermont received some very good news recent polls put him atop the leaderboard for the key early states of iowa and new hampshire as well as the behemoth primary in california similarly encouraging was a recent poll of likely voters showing sanders with a four point lead over the sitting president while outperforming all other democratic candidates among independent and young voters groups viewed as highly important to defeating donald trump in 2020 after the polls were released major media outlets began deploying relentless attacks against the senator over complete nonstories as clear a sign as any that the political pundit class is terrified of sanders chances of winning the nomination but this article is not about the argument for his electability which nevertheless grows stronger with each passing day instead it is about why the united states and indeed the world needs bernie sanders to win though the coyote culture editorial staff does not always ascribe to the efficacy of the american political process the urgency of our problems requires us to put aside any doubts we may have about electoralism and throw our considerable weight behind the effort to make senator sanders president sanders during the most recent cnn sponsored debate the event s hosts were clearly determined to steer the conversation away from the substantive but boring policy and into the candidate s personal grievances with one another or other insignificant political dramas while this may well be a good strategy to boost viewership it gave those viewers little idea of what many of the candidates actually believe this is however an excellent strategy to make the election more about personality and appearance than about how it might affect voters despite the clear bias by the moderators asking questions so shallow that standing in a puddle of them wouldn t get your feet wet the key moment of the debate came when the topic turned to trade when asked whether or not sanders supported a new trade deal with canada and mexico he began talking about climate change as the moderator interrupted to condescendingly remind the senator that the question was over trade bernie responded by saying they re the same thing this moment illustrates how sanders is one of the rare politicians who understands the grave problems we face are not discrete issues to be tackled one at a time but the product of a much larger system of ideology that has metastasized into all areas of our lives few other politicians have the foresight or political courage to explain how as climate change accelerates populations in south and central america will be forced to migrate to survive increasing the burden on their already overburdened states sanders is the only candidate running to come out in opposition to trump s nafta revision the united states mexico canada agreement usmca he argues that it does not provide adequate protections for workers in either the united states or mexico as the us will continue to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs while mexican workers will be subject to the country s poor labor practices facing even greater exploitation by american corporations moreover the agreement does absolutely nothing to address the responsibility of the three nations to address climate change which he calls an outrage as it surely is any modest short term improvement in trade imbalance will inevitably be more than offset by the long term ramifications of a plan that does not incorporate provisions for climate change to give in to this trump led trade deal is to compromise so severely on climate one of the biggest threats to global stability in modern history that it would be a betrayal of the public trust to chalk it up as anything other than an abject failure of the democrats to protect their constituents this is not the only issue that makes bernie the climate candidate the sunrise movement the nation s preeminent activist group fighting to end the behavior that has put us in such a precarious position in regards to climate also endorsed the senator last week this is due in large part to the senator s adoption of the alexandria ocasio cortez sponsored green new deal while a robust spirit of climate denialism on the right still ravages the discourse in this country and others few political figures on the left are willing to admit how immense the scale of the problem is and how great the task is before us for this reason the green new deal does not stop at increasing environmental protections or disincentivizing bad climate related behavior many of the solutions instituted by slightly more forward thinking governments like that of france have shown the inefficacy of a climate program that does little to address the problems of the working class and even less to assure them that they will not bear most of the sacrifice required of humanity to ensure our continued survival as prices of fuel spiked in the country the workers of france took to the streets to voice their displeasure in the strongest of terms anyone familiar with revolutionary history knows that as the people of france get more and more frustrated with their leadership the word revolution is found on more and more lips and only the most ignorant of leaders would dismiss this as a bluff when taxes are raised on fossil fuels to discourage their use millionaires and billionaires will only be slightly poorer millionaires and billionaires while truck drivers and commuters will have their already meager wages garnished when governments institute cap and trade programs to encourage changes to renewable energy energy companies can use their massive reserves of money to pivot their business models while workers are left without a job and without options this is why the green new deal hearkens back to fdr s plan to get america back on track in the wake of the great depression it includes massive investments in infrastructure construction high speed rails agriculture and all sectors of the economy to support a federal jobs guarantee essentially rendering unemployment a relic of the past if we are going to live in a world where you need to work to eat why would we allow for a system that necessitates a certain level of unemployment at any given time bernie sanders says we should not and his plan to transform the economic ecological cultural and political framework of our country does not stop there however no discussion of restoring economic justice can be taken seriously without an institution of racial justice in a country that has never had it as a people we must face the fact that our nation was built on a foundation of white supremacy grew economically powerful as a function of white supremacy and maintained a tradition of white supremacy as to not upset the power structures that learned to enjoy its consequences the terrible police violence we have witnessed against unarmed black and brown citizens in recent years is not a recent development despite only recently being noticed by white populations it is also a symptom of the prison industrial complex that developed out of a desire to keep black people in chains and working for free after the end of slavery though reparations may go a long way toward healing the wounds of slavery racism and discrimination if we do not bring an end to the systematic oppression of communities of color it will ultimately do little good bernie s extensive plan to put a stop to policies that unfairly target communities of color includes ending the war on drugs expunging sentences for marijuana convictions and other nonviolent offenses abolishing private prisons who are incentivized to put and keep more people in prison ending mandatory minimum sentencing as well as cash bail and reforming police procedures and culture these comprehensive policies will set the tone for a future where all people in our country are finally equal in the eyes of the law though the changes he wants to make are often seen as radical in the political context of the united states this is not unlike a ten year old thinking it is radical to order something besides chicken fingers at a mexican restaurant when that is all they have ever tried some form of guaranteed inexpensive healthcare is a reality in every major developed nation in the world with the exception of the united states despite the fact that we are far and away the most wealthy in terms of gdp per capita medical debt is the number one contributor to bankruptcy in the united states which bernie has promised to eliminate as president everyone needs healthcare at some point and american politicians have allowed companies to profit from our pain this system has remained relatively unquestioned by the mainstream media and bulk of politicians for decades not because it is more cheap and efficient as the lie is often told but because the most powerful actors in the industry benefit from it immensely and can pay out the nose to ensure its survival incidentally four of the ten wealthiest corporations in the united states are healthcare companies in some form or fashion the story is little different when it comes to obtaining a higher education in this country because the root causes are the same growing up out children are told they simply must go to college to find wealth success and fulfillment it is no coincidence that this manufactured requirement for prosperity also requires mortgaging their future to a predatory lending ecosystem in order to attend university unless one has parents that can pay for college of course this gives an obvious advantage to students from well off families and is a major reason why the united states lags so far behind our similarly developed peers in social mobility or the ability to raise your social class from the one you were born into senator sanders initiative to make public college free for the country s students and eliminate student debt would go a long way towards racial and class which are often the same in the u s equality in college admissions and free up the nearly one trillion dollars currently burdening our nation s graduates back into the economy it seems intuitive that a healthy well educated populace makes a country stronger unfortunately a better country is often not the goal of the oligarchs who have run our country in the preceding decades you don t need any advanced degrees to see where the disconnect lies there is only one reason why you either die or go bankrupt in this country if you experience a medical emergency without health insurance there is only one reason why the best chance to improve your lot in life is to tie yourself to a boulder of debt for twenty years or more that is because of the profound greed of the country s ruling class and their desire to consolidate power it is not difficult to imagine how to pay for free at the point of use healthcare when you realize that amazon paid exactly zero dollars in federal taxes last year despite its chief executive jeff bezos owning assets in excess of 100 billion even the billionaires we have come to associate with giving their fortunes to philanthropy like bill gates have never been wealthier oftentimes these philanthropic endeavors are actually just convenient ways to excuse themselves from contributing to society s coffers while providing themselves with excellent press a less educated citizenry oftentimes means less critical and informed voters that can be more easily manipulated by the deceptions of the rich and powerful a bernie sanders presidency will finally force these modern day robber barons to not only pay their fair share but to reckon with their selfish behavior and not a moment too soon the reason bernie is often more adamant about the redistribution of wealth is because he understands that it has already been happening for generations but in the least productive way possible the top 10 and to a much greater extent the top 1 and 0 1 of wealth hoarders in this country have gradually been redistributing the wealth of the poor and middle class directly into their own pockets following the great depression fdr s new deal mandated progressive income taxes and increases in union power led to the great compression wherein the wealth gap between the richest americans and the bottom 90 of americans was at its lowest though american workers were among the most exploited in the developed world in terms of their contributions to the economy versus their share of the gains it still represented the period of productivity that made the united states the richest country in the world while creating a robust middle class as the conservative movement took power in the late 1970s and reagan rose to power this trend began to reverse rapidly it is an important distinction to note that bernie a democratic socialist as opposed a social democrat or some other vein of lesser progressive understands that so long as the levers of power are firmly in the grasp of capital we will always end up in a situation where the workers produce most of the country s wealth but see far less of it today the three richest men in america control more wealth than the bottom half of the entire country even the most staunch capitalist has to admit they could not possibly deserve as much as they have in no world do those three men provide as much value to the country as the half that does the bulk of all actual labor the ultra rich have what they do because they stole it from their employees wages cheated a system by exploiting rules designed specifically for them and extorted it from the public trust under the indifferent watch of politicians too cowardly or too self interested to stop them in the opinion of this publication as well as that of the world s left bernie is far from a radical that said his ideological underpinnings as a socialist separate him from the field in the most meaningful way democratic socialism is not about a redistribution of wealth though that is a consequence of socialist policy it is about restoring the ownership of the means of production to the workers and democratizing our lives beyond the political process one of the most undiscussed and unsung planks of the senator s platform despite its being one of the first priorities listed on his website is his initiative to increase workplace democracy this plan would double union membership by removing much of the union busting legislation passed since the reagan years that have left the workers who form the foundation of our economy without protection from the abuses of owners and bosses most importantly to the cause of worker justice though is his plan to ensure that workers own at least 20 of all publicly traded companies while electing at least 45 of all the companies board members an employee who has no agency in the workplace or no stock in the success of the company has little reason to increase their productivity or demonstrate any loyalty to the firm but if the worker owns a part of the company and has a say in how it is run they have a vested interest in seeing the business reach greater heights the below graph shows how worker productivity has far outpaced worker pay since the 1970s when the union busting of the reagan and gingrich era began in earnest the lives of workers and the health of the nation can be dramatically improved by restoring the rights taken from workers such as collective bargaining power protection from unfair firing practices and guarantees to the right to organize a robust secure workforce is as much a key to continued economic prosperity as an educated and healthy one the issues we have listed in this article represent what we consider to be the main obstacles to true economic and political freedom in the united states and so it is bernie s proposed solutions to these obstacles that we decided to focus on of course every good socialist knows the ultimate root of injustice lies in the incentive structure be it housing immigration the military industrial complex wall street reform gun control voter enfranchisement or any of the items discussed in this article their origins can be traced to the desire for profit and a capitalist system that rewards that type of behavior the reality is even sanders is not radical enough to put an end to our most pressing problems he is however aware of the profound greed of a ruling class that puts profits over people and consolidation of wealth over country his election to the presidency as much as i would like it to be is not a political revolution even if elected to install the necessary changes would require mass mobilization against corporations the media and entrenched political interests this is why his campaign slogan is not me us a victory for bernie is a victory for all of us yes but only because it puts the poor marginalized and vulnerable in the best position in over half a century to bring necessary change to this nation from there it is on all of us to do the work in the eyes of we here at coyote culture there is currently no one running for president more capable of inspiring millions

bloomberg opinion outside china thailand has the largest number of patients infected by the novel coronavirus unfortunately the export reliant 500 billion economy southeast asia s second largest was sickly even before the outbreak of the pneumonia like illness that reflects simultaneous blows from the sino u s trade war the worst drought in decades and a stubbornly strong currency add in beijing s newly imposed restrictions on chinese travelers who account for the lion s share of arrivals plus the knock on effect on other tourists and a recession begins to look imminent thailand has lagged its southeast asian neighbors for some time while political upheaval has been a major drag there are others too an aging population poor productivity flatlining consumption and hefty household debt the central bank now expects gdp growth of 2 5 for 2019 that s considerably worse than even lackluster peers like malaysia and indonesia and the country s weakest pace since 2014 the year a military junta took power exports also shrank in 2019 with shipments in the key carmaking industry declining thailand is a regional hub for vehicle manufacturers like nissan motor co which have been affected by poor demand in major markets such as china advertisement advertisement then there s the baht the thai currency outperformed last year despite policymakers efforts on the back of a yawning current account surplus weak inflation and near record foreign exchange reserves the baht s recent weakening has been one of the few positive side effects of the coronavirus epidemic in november thailand relaxed rules on capital outflows to ease upward pressure but central bank officials know that too much tinkering in the market could prompt washington to label it a currency manipulator meanwhile fiscal stimulus including an infrastructure drive was held up by wrangling around the 2020 government budget an interest rate cut this coming week to a record low of 1 looks likely so the year had already started poorly now with 19 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus most of them chinese travelers and the illness spreading fast it looks a whole lot worse in the third quarter the economy expanded only 0 1 compared to the previous three months analysts say fourth quarter numbers reported this month could show a slip into negative territory a further contraction in the first three months of 2020 would put thailand into a technical recession the first and most direct factor is tourism depending on how you measure it the industry accounts for roughly a fifth of thailand s gdp visitor numbers were already depressed by the strong baht which made other tropical destinations cheaper chinese tourists who were supposed to flock back as the impact of a 2018 boat disaster waned were trickling in only slowly that makes china s restrictions to contain the pandemic all the more painful on jan 24 travel agencies were ordered to stop selling tour packages overseas while many more chinese now venture abroad alone roughly half still go with groups thailand s finance ministry warned last wednesday that the virus and related bans could have a three month impact meaning 400 000 fewer visitors tourism authorities have forecast an even steeper chinese drop story continues for thailand that s more than a peak season blow china accounts for the largest number of visitors some 11 million traveled last year according to thai authorities they also splurge more per head than any other nationality amounting to an estimated total of almost 18 billion in 2019 that s just over a quarter of spending by overseas visitors as reported by thailand s tourism authority consider the knock on effect on other nationalities and it becomes clear why citigroup inc analysts have cut their expected increase in tourist numbers for 2020 to 0 5 from 6 5 there are also harder to measure second order impacts like the impact of slower chinese growth on the wider region on global growth and on trade consumption will suffer the experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome which brought the region to its knees in 2003 offers some consolation back then the most affected economies including hong kong bounced back quickly by august 2003 hong kong arrivals were back at pre sars levels in part thanks to rules that made it easier for mainland travelers to cross the border china appears to have moved more swiftly this time it is better equipped and this virus appears less deadly but the scale of the epidemic is still hard to measure and both china and tourism account for a far larger slice of thailand s economy than ever before add in a crippling drought and budget troubles have delayed much needed fiscal stimulus to go with lower interest rates thai stocks marked their steepest drop since 2016 last monday it s hard to argue that pessimism is overdone to contact the author of this story clara ferreira marques at cferreirama bloomberg net to contact the editor responsible for

formally acquitted the president on wednesday of charges that he abused his power and obstructed congress via afp drew angerer getty images a fter emerging intact from his impeachment and trial us president donald trump can now trumpet his economic record as he battles to win re election in november the businessman turned politician inherited an economy in the upswing from his predecessor barack obama recovering from the ravages of the 2008 global financial crisis and rather than falter or die of old age the expansion has continued through trump s first three years in office giving him a trump card in the campaign to win a second term in november but there are some chinks in his armor as well as growing fears about the economic damage done by the coronavirus outbreak in china which raise doubts about how long the good times can last jobs gains continue jobs jobs jobs the president tweeted friday following a blockbuster employment report showing the us economy created 225 000 jobs last month he used the hashtag promisesmadepromiseskept last year job growth averaged 175 000 compared to 193 000 in 2018 and 176 000 in 2017 slower than the final three years of the obama administration the unemployment rate now at 3 6 percent near its lowest point in 50 years compared to 4 7 percent in december 2016 obama s last full month in office and joblessness in the hispanic and black communities has tumbled to historic lows for african americans the unemployment rate fell to 5 9 percent in december from 7 8 percent in december 2016 for hispanics it dropped to 4 2 percent from 5 9 percent average hourly earnings increased 2 9 percent in 2019 keeping slightly ahead of inflation record growth the economy is now in its 11th year of expansion a record period of growth but has fallen short of trump s lofty promises after reaching 1 5 percent gdp growth in 2016 the last year of obama s term in 2017 it climbed to 2 3 percent and the following year to 2 9 percent thanks to stimulus from the massive tax cut aimed mostly at corporations and the wealthiest americans and increased government spending particularly on the military but growth slowed to 2 3 percent last year after trump s trade war with china intensified which discouraged business investment while the us is in better shape than most advanced economies the eurozone grew only 1 2 percent it is unlikely to see long periods of 3 0 percent or higher as trump promised treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this week the economy could have hit the target last year were it not for the problems faced by boeing the aerospace giant has been in crisis mode since its top selling 737 max aircraft was grounded in march 2019 following two fatal crashes which shut down exports of the plane the imf predicts us growth will slow even further this year to 2 0 percent as the boost from the tax cut fades away deficits climbing the tax cuts approved by congress at the end of 2017 the most significant tax reform in 30 years helped boost gdp growth but also drove government debt and the deficit higher the reform cut income taxes on the richest americans while slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent the budget deficit is projected to breach 1 trillion by the end of september according to the congressional budget office while government debt is expected to represent 81 percent of us gdp mnuchin said trump is planning to slash taxes for the middle class as well trade tensions eased trump has congratulated himself on signing a momentous initial trade deal last month to end the long battle with beijing but at what cost china pledged to buy some 200 billion in us goods but tariffs on about two thirds of the goods traded between the economic powers remain in place and the conflict slowed us and global growth and sent domestic manufacturing into a recession trump did fulfill his campaign promise to renegotiate the 1994 continental free trade deal with mexico and canada creating the usmca the new pact also signed in january replaces what trump called the worst trade deal in us history though experts say it amounts to an update rather than an overhaul booming stock market wall street has cheered the tax cuts and loosening of regulations by the trump administration gaining around 55 percent since he was elected on november 8 2016 that will be another selling point to americans whose retirement wealth depends in large part on stock prices
with his impeachment trial drawing to a close president donald trump is expected to deliver an economic message in his third state of the union address tuesday night his tone is expected to be markedly different from the foreboding chord he struck in 2017 obviously he s going to have a theme to this speech that is akin to mission accomplished in the sense of branding it as a great american comeback said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate com by many metrics the economy is healthy but economists say that much of the same data indicates slowing growth and that many of the rosy top line numbers obscure a more nuanced portrait of america s financial health labor market the u s labor market added 145 000 jobs in december for a total of 2 1 million throughout 2019 an average of 176 000 per month according to the bureau of labor statistics while unemployment is at a historic low of 3 5 percent last year s gains failed to match those of 2018 when the economy added 2 7 million jobs an average of 223 000 per month trump frequently claims that his presidency has been a boon for black workers whose unemployment rate is at an all time low but as the left leaning economic policy institute points out that doesn t tell the whole story because black workers are still twice as likely as their white counterparts to be without jobs a disparity that persists throughout all education levels stock market the benchmark s p 500 rose by 29 percent in 2019 although that came on the heels of a december 2018 rout that erased all of the gains for that year in a matter of weeks in spite of a phase one deal that called a truce to the trade war with china business investment remains anemic and higher costs from tariffs weigh on corporate profits stocks have spent the early weeks of 2020 buffeted by those challenges coupled with the unfolding coronavirus crisis the stock market has seen a re emergence of volatility hamrick said that s one of the hallmarks of the return of volatility which is that you can see big swings down as well as up economists point out that since the end of the recession the wealthiest americans have disproportionately benefited from the stock market s meteoric recovery most of the beneficiaries of the economy have been the folks at the top of the income and wealth distribution only half of americans own any stock at all said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics even among the half of the country with exposure to stocks most are invested in index or mutual funds through 401 k or similar retirement vehicles and zandi said a significant number of lower income households are still living paycheck to paycheck consumer confidence the most recent consumer confidence readings preceded the spread of and alarm over the chinese coronavirus before that however the prevailing sentiment was one of optimism according to the conference board about half of americans characterize jobs as plentiful for many the job market is a proxy of sentiment hamrick said the low unemployment rate is a tide that lifts many boats he said consumer confidence might be the biggest unsung hero of the economic momentum that has propelled the expansion in recent quarters although businesses have been keeping cash on the sidelines or using it for stock buybacks ordinary americans have been spending at a steady clip fueling what some economists have dubbed a virtuous cycle of demand and corresponding economic activity residential real estate lower interest rates have reinvigorated home sales which climbed by 3 6 percent in december on a month to month basis with mortgage rates at 3 5 percent financing a home is affordable but the home itself might not be the number of home sales for the year is roughly flat when compared with 2018 although the median price was 274 500 in december a jump of nearly 8 percent on an annualized basis while they are a boon for sellers zandi said rising prices could be keeping homeownership out of reach for many americans the other aspect of that is it makes it difficult for first time homebuyers to get in he said wage growth in spite of record low unemployment economists point out that wage growth remained slack throughout the economic recovery dipping below 3 percent in the most recent report the lack of more substantial and significant wage gains has probably been the primary complaint hamrick said wage growth may well have peaked download the nbc news app for breaking news hamrick added that state and local minimum wage hikes have helped drive income gains for low wage workers nevertheless the distribution of some of these wage gains does have a tendency to lift people at the lowest level of the income spectrum he said the persistently low rate of wage growth has been somewhat mitigated by a parallel trend of muted inflation in the post recession years but the exceptions are big ones for many americans higher costs for health care and education have canceled out the rise in pay those things are challenges that tend to undermine some of the benefits of the improvement in wages hamrick said industrial production manufacturing has been in contraction since late summer as factories struggle with the impact of the trade war higher input costs due to tariffs and reduced demand for u s made goods in china as a result of retaliatory tariffs hamrick referred to the sector s struggle as a self inflicted wound by trump the president to some degree created his own problem by deciding to embark on trade confrontations he said the brunt of the headwinds is being borne by states that were crucial to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has been losing jobs over the past year particularly in key swing states like pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin zandi said that s really an area where his policies particularly his trade policies have been very counterproductive zandi added that the coronavirus epidemic threatens to drag down the sector further as demand for oil copper and other industrial commodities slumps gdp growth economists say steady if sluggish growth in gross domestic product signals no risk of a recession in the near future but the economy has been unable to eke out the kind of growth trump has repeatedly promised even after corporate tax rates were slashed hamrick characterized the president s pledges of outsize gdp growth as unrealistic comparing the economy to a formidable but slow moving ocean liner even though it was given an injection of jet fuel to some degree with the tax cuts and jobs act it now appears that the benefits of the tax law are behind us he said there s no doubt that we ve not seen the return to the sustained 3 percent real gdp growth that president trump spoke of

banking committee where powell heads on wednesday has already sent him a list of questions about last autumn s upheaval in the repurchase agreement market where banks go to secure funding to meet their reserve requirements the episode when a cash squeeze drove overnight repo interest rates to 10 forced the fed back into the active bond buying business for the first time in some five years and it scooped up more than 300 billion of t bills since the fed has also become the lender of first resort in the repo market pumping tens of billions of dollars each day into money markets to ensure liquidity and avoid another squeeze policy makers believe the repo riot was triggered by having allowed bank reserve levels to fall too low in the roughly two years it had been letting the stash of

rate ticked higher to 63 4 the highest since 2013 led by gains in the prime age participation rate which we ll discuss in more detail below despite the historically low unemployment rate wage growth remained solid but in check in january with average hourly earnings for all employees rising 3 12 year over year slightly above estimates lower income jobs however continue to see wage growth above the broader averages nonsupervisory wage growth rose by an impressive 3 46 in january real wage growth as measured by real average hourly earnings or real disposable personal income per capita has been near cycle highs for most of the past year core pce inflation data released last week showed that core inflation rose 1 58 last month as inflationary pressures remain muted after a brief inflation scare in 2018 bringing the year over year rate of real wage growth to 1 54 initial and continuing jobless claims haven t shown any real signs of cracks either as both metrics remain near historic lows after trending slightly higher in the weeks before christmas the last four readings have been solid and brought the 4 week moving average back down to 212k near the historic lows of around 202k meanwhile continuing jobless claims continue to remain near historically low levels coming in at 1 751 million in the latest report versus the historic low of 1 642 set in november 2019 the traditional measure of unemployment the u3 unemployment rate ticked slightly higher to at 3 6 from last month s 3 5 reading which matched 50 year lows while the u6 rate ticked up to 6 9 after last month s record low the participation rate ticked higher to 63 4 setting a new post crisis high as we have discussed for the last three years we ve believed that there was significantly more labor market slack remaining in the labor market than traditional metrics would imply slack that has begun to be unleashed by continued wage growth and policy changes that reduce disincentives to employment the prime aged labor force participation rate remains well below pre 2010 levels and there are still roughly 27 million prime aged americans aged 25 54 who are either unemployed or out of the workforce residential construction spending heating up total construction spending in the united states missed economist estimates in december posting a month over month decline for the first time since june despite continued strength from the residential housing sector on a year over year basis however total spending rose by 5 0 which was the strongest rate of growth since september 2018 residential spending rose at a 5 5 annualized rate over the same month last year finishing the year on a high note after significant weakness earlier in 2019 nonresidential spending decreased at a 0 1 annualized rate finishing 2019 with spending levels exactly in line with 2018 levels last week we discussed how growth in residential fixed investment had been a drag on gdp growth for six consecutive quarters but has now recorded positive contributions to growth for two straight quarters consistent with the reacceleration in single family homebuilding that we ve covered extensively in our various reports residential fixed investment rfi contributed 0 2 to total real gdp growth in 4q19 fixed investment in non residential structures however continues to be a drag on total gdp growth subtracting 0 3 from the quarterly figure 2020 performance check up billboard net lease and manufactured housing reits have led the way through the first six weeks of 2020 while the hotel timber and mall reit sectors have lagged as discussed above the broad based commercial real estate indexes are higher by roughly 3 0 compared to the 3 2 gains from the s p 500 homebuilders have picked up where they left off in 2019 with gains of nearly 16 so far this year following gains of nearly 50 last year at 1 58 the 10 year treasury yield has retreated by 34 basis points since the start of the year and is roughly 170 basis points below peak levels of 2018 of 3 25 this week we published vnq a david vs goliath story our etf spotlight series has taken us across the fund landscape from high yield reit etfs and cefs to newer innovative funds offering a more growth oriented approach to real estate the plain vanilla core reit etfs still rule the day from an aum perspective however led by goliath vnq core reit etfs are distinguished by their market capitalization weighting system exposure across most equity reit property sectors and ultra low expense ratio which averages roughly 20 basis points a fraction of the typical actively managed mutual fund or cef we took a look at the property sector breakdown of these six funds we discussed how we ve never been fans of the market capitalization weighting system particularly in the real estate sector a weighting scheme that we view as a somewhat archaic vestigial of a bygone era of high trading costs and before the advent of the insanely efficient etf structure these etfs are heavily skewed towards the upper end of the market cap range due to the top heavy nature of the reit sector which naturally weights the portfolio towards more expensive and lower yielding reits our equally weighted hoya capital reit 150 index essentially encompassing the entire universe of equity reits has an average affox multiple of 16x and dividend yield of 4 80 compared to the core reit average of 23x and 3 0 respectively a function of the vastly different distribution of market capitalizations between the market cap weighted and equal weighted design earlier this week we also published real estate cefs satisfying a high yield fix we examined the most popular cefs with an average dividend yield of 7 0 while we believe etfs are the more suitable option for the vast majority of investors cefs can make sense for certain investors seeking access to leverage active management and are willing to pay a steep expense premium for it for investors who absolutely need the 6 7 yield from their real estate allocation we like the cohen steers suite of levered cefs rqi and rnp and believe that these may indeed be slightly better options for sophisticated investors than the high yield reit etfs covered in the last report especially for tax advantaged accounts that wouldn t benefit quite as much from the substantially superior tax efficiencies of etfs next week s economic calendar it ll be another fairly busy week of economic data in the week ahead highlighted by cpi inflation data on thursday and retail sales data on friday economists are expecting a 2 2 year over year in the core cpi index a deceleration from the 2 3 rate last month retail sales meanwhile are projected to rise by 0 3 from last month after december s

harare the zimbabwe stock exchange zse recorded a significant spike in january notching fresh post dollarisation all time highs shrugging off the deteriorating economy which continues to suppress the prospects of real earnings growth the rally several investment analysts told business times is likely to continue because the continuous devaluation of the zimbabwe dollar will culminate in rampant inflation they believe this will provide sufficient fuel for both the smaller to larger cap firms to follow suit as their top line and bottom line start to jump further this means there will be buying pressure as local investors rush to buy shares which have remained the preferred asset class and provide a safe haven in times of hyperinflation market capitalisation for the local bourse spiked by a whopping 46 in january to close at zwl 43 4bn from zwl 29 8bn recorded december 31 2019 the recovery by the zse which has 63 listed counters was in line with analysts estimates for the bourse s rise a possible decisive factor behind the bullish trend in the stock market was the zimbabwe dollar which further depreciated in january government eliminated the multicurrency regime last year in favour of the zimbabwe dollar which continues to plunge against major currencies zimbabwe is experiencing hyperinflation meaning several stocks on the zse platform do not enjoy high profitability outlook for investors in real terms despite their dramatic spike recently released financial results of companies indicate no real growth in output as foreign currency shortages local currency devaluation power outages fuel shortages low disposable income and increasing costs of operations all continue to weigh down a possible recovery and growth the biggest driver was inflation given that the larger portion of growth in corporate earnings which sent stock figures higher in january for the small and medium sized firms were facilitated on a larger scale by adjustments for inflation all of the financials recently published are inflation adjusted as such prices of stocks will most likely continue their rallies in the equities market in the short to medium term however market analysts believe that one point that should not be overlooked is that the market capitalisation value in united states dollar terms in january was just about us 2 5bn using an interbank rate of zwl 17 us 1 this means that the local bourse remains fragile with total equity exposure clearly in an underweight position in us dollar terms the zse has 63 counters out of these 58 are active stocks while four border timbers cfi cottco hippo and hwange are suspended according to official data obtained from the zse blue chip counters were behind market movement the biggest were retailer ok zimbabwe which hiked 105 delta corporation which controls the beer market in zimbabwe and has the vast majority of the soft drinks share is able to generate lots of free cash flow 49 so was econet wireless zimbabwe the country s biggest mobile phone operator 57 the two companies have free cash flows and do not need huge amounts of re investment the whole time to maintain production the zimbabwe newspapers group notched 139 the increase analysts said was accelerated partly because of the rise in inflation estimated to have reached 520 in january asset managers and other investors see stocks as a safe haven in a time of uncertainty turnover also hit a record high in january it grew 309 to zwl 36 4m from zwl 8 9m recorded at the end of december 2019 what explains the surge is that investors are trying to hedge against inflation so stocks remain the darling of many local investors given the not so pleasing returns on the money market addmore chakurira an investment analyst with one of the leading securities firm in zimbabwe imara edwards securities told business times this week another investment analyst with a top asset management firm in zimbabwe who preferred anonymity suggested the zimbabwe stock market is undervalued and beginning to look cheap he added that blue chip counters moved the bourse but returns lagged behind inflation the bull run the analyst said was more of a correction the blue chips the likes of old mutual econet delta moved up very strongly the analyst said the mid caps still followed but the market was trailing or failed to recover lost ground to inflation annual inflation was around 520 in january but the stock market only moved less than 40 so there is still buying pressure we might see this continuing in the coming months so the bull run was more of a correction than the market charting a new path the analyst said market corrections are likely to be short lived and not last long during the year tafara mtutu an investment analyst with morgan co said a hefty government transaction is believed to have lifted the stock market in january there was quite a significant amount of money in the month of january following a government transaction onto the stock market this drove the market mtutu said also investors were rebuilding their portfolios to fund their next holidays other investment analysts said there were governmentbacked treasury bills that matured in january and the injection of such funds onto the local bourse caused the spike in stocks foreign investor bought a paltry zwl 5242 50 worth of shares during the month from zwl 20 3242 05 at the end of december 2019 they however accelerated their exit from the local bourse selling shares worth zwl 21 1m during the month of january compared to zwl 6m at the end of december to a larger extent recent controls by the reserve bank of zimbabwe which imposed a 90 day moratorium on trading of fungible shares as well as the difficulties faced by foreign investors in repatriation proceeds from their liquidated investments reduced the attractiveness of the local bourse these are taking a bigger bite of the stocks than expected this justified the selling of shares by foreign investors according to analysts analysts said the foreign exodus for zimbabwe stocks has increased setting up january to have the highest outflows in recent years the economy is trapped in a downward cycle consequently this drains the appeal of equities for foreign investors this is why they have been selling their zse traded shares taking outflows to zwl 20m in january this is a record rate in a single month it s a negative signal that such a huge amount was pulled out of the stock market by foreign investors the zse should be attracting foreign investors instead of them continuing to pull out large sums of cash an investment analyst with one of the country s largest asset management firm told business times this week other investment analysts concurred saying in zimbabwe dollar terms january was a good month for stocks but in us dollar terms the stock market was not progressing last month the zse introduced the global industry classification standard in classifying listed counters as part of efforts to offer an efficient investment tool the reclassification under the new framework saw new sector indices introduced which comprises of financials consumer discretionary index consumer staples materials industrials information communications and technology and real estate other indices including all share index zse top 10 top 15 small cap and medium cap among many were also introduced all shares index value closed the month of january at 332 90 points which was an increase of 12 60 the benchmark top 10 index closed the month on a higher note gaining 15 89 to close at 313 10 points which was 15 89 increase while the top 15 could not be outshone climbing 14 80 to close at 308 10 points zimbabwe s small caps dropped 0 875 to close at 831 8 points while the medium cap increased 5 51 to close at 355 88 points out of the seven sector indices five indices traded in the positive and gained value there was however a dramatic drop in some counters top losers during january were tsl limited willdale mashonaland holdings riozim and dairibord zimbabwe limited diversified group tsl limited took a heavy blow shedding 20 of its value to close the month at zwl 0 8000 while willdale limited a brick making company lost 15 to close at zwl 0 0432 property investment and development firm mashonaland holdings lost 14 89 to close at zwl 0 1149 other counters to lose were resources concern riozim and dairibord zimbabwe a milk and dairy products producer which lost 5 31 and 4 15 to close at zwl 2 3200 and zwl 0 5842 respectively business times

adopted ifrs 16 leases which introduces a single lessee accounting model and eliminates the classification of leases as either operating or finance leases the main impact of ifrs 16 to cae is the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability for substantially all leases this change results in a decrease of our operating lease expense and an increase of our finance and depreciation expenses the financial results reported in the press release for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 do not reflect the accounting changes required by ifrs 16 as the company adopted the standard using

are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward looking statements we caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results non gaap and other financial measures this press release includes non gaap and other financial measures non gaap measures are useful supplemental information but may not have a standardized meaning according to gaap these measures should not be confused with or used as an alternative for performance measures calculated according to gaap they should also not be used to compare with similar measures from other companies management believes that providing certain non gaap measures provides users with a better understanding of our results and trends and provides additional information on our financial and operating performance 1 segment operating income soi is a non gaap measure and is the sum of our key indicators of each segment s financial performance segment operating income gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment s performance we calculate total segment operating income by taking the operating profit and excluding restructuring costs of major programs that do not arise from significant strategic transactions 2 segment operating income before specific items further excludes restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions we track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and makes it easier to compare across reporting periods 3 free cash flow is a non gaap measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations we use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity we calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities subtracting maintenance capital expenditures investment in other assets not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds net of payments from equity accounted investees 4 order intake and backlog order intake is a non gaap measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received for the civil aviation training solutions segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract additionally expected future revenues from customers under short term and long term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated for the defence and security segment we consider an item part of our order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party s obligations to form the basis for a contract defence and security contracts are usually executed over a long term period but some of them must be renewed each year for this segment we only include a contract item in order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it for the healthcare segment order intake is typically converted into revenue within one year therefore we assume that order intake is equal to revenue the book to sales ratio is the total orders divided by total revenue in a given period total backlog is a non gaap measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options obligated backlog represents the value of our order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments if the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified the backlog is revised through adjustments joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above unfunded backlog represents firm defence and security orders we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained options are included in backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised but indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts are excluded when an option is exercised it is considered order intake in that period and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options 5 net income before specific items is a non gaap measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results we calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the company from continuing operations and excluding restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions as well as significant one time tax items we track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance and makes it easier to compare across reporting periods 6 earnings per share eps before specific items is a non gaap measure calculated by excluding restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions as well as significant one time tax items from the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the company the effect per share is obtained by dividing these restructuring costs integration costs acquisition costs and other gains net of tax as well as one time tax items by the average number of diluted shares we track it because we believe it provides a better indication of our operating performance on a per share basis and makes it easier to compare across reporting periods 7 a full flight simulator ffs is a full size replica of a specific make model and series of an aircraft cockpit including a motion system in our count of ffss deployed in the network we generally only include ffss that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices or other lower level devices as these are typically used in addition to ffss in the same approved training programs 8 utilization rate is one of the operating measures we use to assess the performance of our civil simulator training network while utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized we track it together with other measures because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance we calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period 9 simulator equivalent unit seu is an operating measure we use to show the total average number of ffss available to generate earnings during the period 10 maintenance capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity growth capital expenditure is a non gaap measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity 11 net debt is a non gaap measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents we use it as an indicator of our overall financial position and calculate it by taking our total long term debt including the current portion of long term debt and subtracting cash and cash equivalents 12 net debt to capital is calculated as net debt divided by the sum of total equity plus net debt 13 return on capital employed roce is a non gaap measure we use to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital we calculate this ratio over a rolling four quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the company excluding net finance expense after tax divided by the average capital employed for non gaap and other financial measures monitored by cae please refer to cae s md a filed with the canadian securities

bloomberg carlos viloria came home to venezuela last month a 35 year old lawyer he d had enough of 15 hour days and abusive bosses as a restaurant worker in argentina for a year and a half one of more than 5 million venezuelans who ve left over the past five years hoping to escape one of the world s worst humanitarian catastrophes his return is also emblematic i m going to find a job that pays in dollars he said after leading his country s economy over a cliff president nicolas maduro has brought it a certain measure of stability by allowing dollars to flow freely and private enterprise to flourish in recent months he seems to have breathed new life into his regime he remains widely despised but emigration has begun to slow people are returning and the government is enacting laws to tax dollar transactions and allow companies to issue debt in foreign currencies all are signs that despite a triumphant world tour including a white house meeting with president donald trump opposition leader juan guaido is further away from ousting maduro than he was a year ago when he announced that plan and won wide international support help from allies at the time many wrote off maduro he had after all taken one of the region s richest countries and run it into the ground through corruption and colossal mismanagement then a year ago the u s smacked maduro with sanctions on oil his country took a big hit and many believed he couldn t survive but the doubters didn t realize how much help he d get from key allies to evade sanctions or how he d adopt a version of chinese style state capitalism the economies of the countries that have helped us are capitalist china turkey and india said david paravisini a lawmaker in venezuela s national constituent assembly associated with maduro to get their aid you need conditions of economic liberalism that s what china did to move forward it s what we have to do the new approach includes secret talks maduro has had with holders of some 60 billion in bonds some of them american offering to pair them up with a foreign drilling company that would be granted the rights to oil fields as a means of their recouping debt venezuela has the world s largest known oil reserves and if this deal came to fruition many investors could reap enormous profits several who ve met with maduro recently say he s more confident than they ve seen him in a long time they spoke on the condition of anonymity elliott abrams the u s special envoy for venezuela disagrees why is this happening he asked reporters on thursday referring to the dollarization and privatization because their backs are against the wall worthless bolivar over the past year the u s dollar has become venezuela s unofficial currency appearing in cafeteria menus and mom and pop shop windows blocks from the presidential palace across the capital bodegas filled with french champagne vacuum sealed salmon and grana padano italian cheese appeared where bankrupt shops had once been the bolivar the official currency has become worthless through years of hyperinflation what we saw wasn t a liberalization but a permissiveness and in some cases a legal framework that existed but wasn t enforced said tamara herrera chief economist at caracas based consultancy sintesis financiera the need arose because of progressively intensifying u s sanctions the new decrees show the government s fiscal hunger and punitive nature oil production after plunging for nearly a decade is finally stabilizing at 800 000 barrels a day stemming some of the economic hemorrhaging this year s projected contraction while still stunning at 10 is a far cry from the 35 a year ago and 65 in the past five years the country s constituent assembly approved a value added tax last month to reap benefit from the estimated 70 of all transactions this year set to occur in dollars until now the government hadn t collected vat on the dollar sales a lost opportunity to make up for a dramatic drop in revenue we are doing this now because there are signs that point to a recovery of the economy said jesus faria a socialist party lawmaker at the national constituent assembly but we have a highly speculative economy in which price fixers especially merchants take every opportunity to set and obtain extraordinary profits and incentives for national production must be created through more efficient policies price police this has meant an abrupt return to some statist socialism venezuela s price control agency said it inspected more than 1 900 stores in january commerce minister eneida laya recently said 135 agents had been dispatched across the country to end the speculative economy scrutiny had declined in recent months the government is watching closely again they came last week to tell us to cut our profits to 30 which we had to do but it hurt our business said maria luisa pereira who sells flour rice and condiments at quinta crespo market in western caracas how can we survive on so little with hyperinflation they hadn t been here in months and now they threatened us to come two more times in february we re afraid meanwhile fewer venezuelans are leaving according to two polling firms datanalisis and delphos in a december report from datanalisis those expressing a desire to leave the country fell to 38 down 5 points from a year before of those who ve emigrated in the past five years 17 or about 1 million have returned over the same period the data show maduro s government says it s overseen the return of more than 17 000 since 2018 through the come back to the fatherland plan the united nations still projects that this year the number of emigrating venezuelans will surpass the 6 million syrians who ve been driven from their homeland there s been an irony about the venezuelan emigration that the government knows but doesn t mention those who leave send remittances in dollars and also reduce the numbers needing to be fed and housed ecoanalitica a research firm says remittances have risen from 2 7 billion in 2018 to what it estimates will be 4 billion this year xenophobia luis vicente leon head of datanalisis said that the emigration of venezuelans has slowed recently not only because of new opportunities at home but because of new restrictions and xenophobic backlash abroad the barriers in those countries are increasing dramatically and make exit more difficult especially for those without visas or resources leon said also with the dollarization staying home seems to be less traumatic than emigrating viloria the lawyer who s just back from buenos aires said he found life there hard at the beginning they required me to work too many hours 15 hours a day sometimes and they paid me much less than the minimum wage he said i couldn t complain or i d get fired they made me stand for 10 hours straight i only had 15 minutes to eat and many times i had to eat standing he rented a small room in an apartment he shared with two others he also felt unwelcome often some of the argentine managers were xenophobic he said once they told a venezuelan partner that he had come from venezuela like a cockroach in venezuela we have water and electricity failures but at least i live in my house in argentina it s true that i could walk around safely at night and there are a lot of cultural events but i spent all my time working often being mistreated and the money wasn t enough i m putting my hopes in dollarization with assistance from fabiola zerpa ben bartenstein nicolle yapur and nick wadhams to contact the reporters on this story

decrypt s art fashion and entertainment hub discover scene last week the white house announced a new immigration ban on nigerians entering the us it s a move that seems to have poured cold water on nigeria s dreams of becoming a major tech hub and africa s premier bitcoin hotspot the ban will prevent thousands of people from being able to move to the united states but the knock on effect is much greater on recipients of the billions of dollars in remittances sent home by nigerians in the us each year the new rules will impact nearly a quarter of the people on the african continent and are likely to exert a heavy toll on african economies as well as impacting america s image in the region but could this cloud have a silver lining for nigeria s bitcoin enthusiasts nigeria accused of terrorist risk the new ban prevents nigerians as well as citizens of eritrea kyrgyzstan myanmar sudan and tanzania from applying for immigration to the us under the latter s green card lottery which offers permanent resident status to applicants from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the us ad ad the white house alleges that nigeria along with other banned states does not

really afford to ignore them fortunately others are not so shortsighted
by geoff smith barani krishnan and yasin ebrahim investing com although closing friday on a down note stocks rallied sharply this week as the coronavirus earnings and employment data took most of investors attention along with the wild swings in tesla but among things that may have gone overlooked two u k companies that could be surfing the sustainability wave came into view the trump administration kept coal as a talking point and the fed indicated that while the sidelines is still where it feels most comfortable the impact of the coronavirus isn t being ignored here are three things that flew under the radar this week 1 will the plastic purge create a cardboard boon with environmental and sustainability considerations playing an ever greater role in the decisions of big institutional investors it s worth taking a moment to think how all those big passive bucks could move a stock that checks the right boxes boxes being the operative word cardboard boxes to be precise two london listed stocks offer interesting exposure to one of the great megatrends of the coming years the shift away from plastic packaging irish based smurfit kappa lon and u k based ds smith lon which is also europe s largest recycler of paper both stand to benefit smurfit stock rose more than 8 this week on the back of results that showed margins widening and debt a perennial concern given the cyclicality of the business falling to the middle of its target range while the breadth of its operations throws up a fair amount of problems in the last two years it was expropriated in venezuela and was fined 136 million for anti competitive behavior in italy its core operations in europe the u s and emerging markets are solid ds smith is arguably the more stable business by virtue of its concentration on fast moving consumer goods less prone to downturns than discretionary packages delivered by amazon nasdaq it s also less exposed to exotic places like venezuela it stands to be a big beneficiary of initiatives like that announced by u k supermarket chain sainsbury s which promised last week to throw 1 billion pounds at getting plastic out of its supply chain initiatives that are likely to become ever more common as the revolt against plastic spreads 2 u s sends 64 million canary into coal mines it sounded just like the kind of thing that would have gotten green groups all up in arms a coal first energy policy that conjures images of more carbon emissions in a world that needs exactly less yet the u s coal first yes in caps initiative floated by energy secretary dan brouillette was clever enough in language that it got the attention it wanted without the bad press what brouillette really announced was a 64 million flexible innovative resilient small transformative initiative to develop the coal plant of the future needed to provide secure and reliable power to the u s grid coal is a critical resource for grid stability that will be used in developing countries around the world well into the future as they build their economies brouillette said in a statement issued by the department of energy while from the text we could see where the energy secretary was going those hearing the policy the first time an announcement brouillette chose to make during a speech at the atlantic council in washington friday morning would be forgiven for thinking that president donald trump was trying to throw coal miners yet another lifeline ahead of his november reelection bid as keith johnson at foreignpolicy com observed in an october post trump came into the white house vowing to end the obama administration s so called war on coal and make anthracite great again instead trump is overseeing a cascading collapse of america s coal industry a trend that could have political consequences for him in the 2020 u s presidential election johnson wrote noting that there were eight bankruptcies filed by coal mining companies last year alone to be sure his words weren t taken out of context brouillette said soon after announcing his coal first policy that the efforts we re undertaking is not to subsidize the industry and preserve their status if you will as a large electricity generator it is simply to make the product cleaner and to look for alternative uses for this product or this commodity he said no one is going to deny the fact or argue with the point that coal as a percentage of u s electricity generation is declining and will probably continue to decline the evolving u s energy mix requires cleaner more reliable and highly efficient plants steven winberg the doe assistant secretary for fossil added in the statement technologies developed for the coal first initiative will lead to just that reliable highly efficient plants with zero or near zero emissions 3 fed factoring in coronavirus for months traders have been eager to find out what additional factors apart from the pace of inflation will drive a material risk to the federal reserve s outlook and force it off the sidelines but fed chairman jerome powell has given little away that all changed early this week when the fed chief identified a new risk to the central bank s outlook on the economy the coronavirus more recently possible spillovers from the effects of the coronavirus in china have presented a new risk to the outlook powell said in the latest monetary policy report submitted to congress on friday the recent emergence of the coronavirus however could lead to disruptions in china that spill over to the rest of the global economy amid weak economic activity and dormant inflation pressures foreign central banks generally adopted a more accommodative policy stance the fed chairman added the fed s worries about the risk to its outlook are not without merit with analysts predicting that the virus will do most of its damage in the first quarter of this year goldman sachs said the impact of the disease would lower global gdp by up to 2 in the first quarter 1 directly from china and about 1 from spillover effects whether the impact of the virus will represent a material risk to the u s central bank s outlook remains a hot topic of debate the near term impact is quite large goldman sachs said what happens to 2020 as a whole really depends on how quickly the episode is brought under control the federal reserve fingerprints are all over the more than decade long bull run in stocks its efforts to steady the repo market which began in october have coincided with a sharp upswing in stocks but those hoping for the fed to act sooner rather than later could be left disappointed the new coronavirus outbreak abroad has created some new risks to the near term external growth backdrop but there is little apparent reason for monetary policymakers to consider rate cuts at the moment and we continue to expect the fed to sit on the sidelines through 2020 rbc said in a note
some of my peers in the city already own a condominium unit or are paying mortgage for it in the best case scenario they pay while they reside in their units most of the others are saving up to pay a deposit almost all of them look forward to having a single detached dwelling as a permanent residence once they have families i have always felt insecure about this as i have not begun investing on a home over the past decade since i moved to the city for work and school i have been moving from one lease to another on a government salary with rent and residence expenses taking up almost half of my monthly budget there really is not much left after bills and recreation i did not grow up in a home where fiscal responsibility was a premium value so i did not have much in the way of savings either but one thing i am certain of is that i am not alone in my insecurity advertisement my generation has been raised mostly by the boomer generation ur parents or teachers were born after world war ii they were probably brought up by their own parents who suffered economic difficulties so they became pretty obsessed with property ownership add to this the american dream promoted by a mostly western media and the vestiges of a colonial education so it was that governments encouraged home ownership and gave tax incentives and subsidies for mortgages only for those governments to suffer recession in the late 2000s due to mortgages not being paid is property ownership still the way to go for us illennials my friends are competing against each other an article in the economist compared the housing economies of britain and switzerland and showed that in britain where 60 70 percent of people own houses the prices of houses have increased by almost 350 percent since 1970 in switzerland where only 38 percent own houses prices have increased only by 70 percent in the same period this is simple supply and demand at work as more of my peers buy or get mortgages for condominiums and houses they make it harder for the others to get on the property ladder and millennials are on average poorer than our boomer counterparts just 60 percent of us are considered middle class compared to 70 percent of the boomer generation when they were in their 20s this is according to an organization for economic cooperation and development oecd report published last year yes the oecd is mostly based on data from developed countries but i think it is representative enough of the global trend so if we are poorer why are we still spending like the last generation we millennials and our younger siblings from gen z are faced with larger problems and with fewer resources to address them advertisement consider climate change the boomers did not have it looming before them or were not aware of it so their drive for economic development was not conscious of the environmental effects we already know this so any development will always be under the shadow of our collective conscience buying a home or worse building one has a significant output in carbon emissions that we seem to forget in our quest to get on the property ladder each lot in a subdivision would have been space for trees to sequester carbon from the atmosphere each condominium unit registered in one s name is equivalent to tons of carbon emissions also in their name every brick of a building was made and transported using fossil fuels we have always looked down on renting as throwing away money but paying millions on a condominium unit built to last only for 40 years is that much different paying a landowner for the temporary use of their property only for the period when it is needed is not throwing away money one merely pays the cost of depriving the owner of the use of their property for a certain period minus the overhead cost of interest payments and maintenance as one would in a mortgage arrangement what is the difference then inheritance yes with ownership one has a legacy to turn over to their progeny when i die if i had lived in rented spaces all my life i would have no property to will to my child but is that so sad if instead of paying for interest under a mortgage i put that money toward better education for them when they have grown with a good education under their belt that would maybe afford them a career far from where they were raised and they would have nothing burdening them no need to wait for a good deal to dispose of property that has depreciated anyway moreover it is the height of hypocrisy to worry about leaving a good home for one s child if in the process of securing that home we leave behind a dying planet and dwindling resources money paying for interest in a mortgage or for maintaining a depreciating house could go toward investing in solar panels in a rented home or contributing toward a fund for reforestation or research on renewable energy perhaps a better inheritance is a solid education a sustainable economy and a living planet our true home is a cool earth and not one single detached dwelling no man is an island the economist article i mentioned above also looked at home ownership in the most developed countries based on the united nations human development index hdi romania has 96 percent home ownership and ranks 52nd on the hdi switzerland has 38 percent home ownership and ranks second as i dwell on my insecurity of not having begun paying for a home i cannot help but wonder what my generation s home ownership would be like and its implications on human development in the philippines your subscription could not be saved please

characteristics of a top as we are experiencing today photo by bloomberg article content it is clear that it would have been a very hard sell a year ago that every single risk on asset class from equities to corporate bonds to commodities would end up rallying as much as they did in 2019 and so perhaps the message for 2020 is to fade all the optimism since fading the pessimism a year ago paid off very well the sharp slide in treasury yields this past year does not exactly comport with the risk on view that has morphed into the consensus forecast we apologize but this video has failed to

moment in time article content we have to choose which asset class has the story right and history sides with the treasury market so that indeed is how we are tilted for 2020 defensively positioned again in addition from a total return perspective a near 20 per cent gain in the long bond not only didn t hurt you but meaningfully outperformed the s p 500 on a risk adjusted basis and by not having to take on any inherent equity capital risk another year of double digit returns on the highest quality long duration bonds is our expectation right now it is critically important to get as close to the truth of clients risk tolerance there have probably never been as many characteristics of a top as we are experiencing today at some point as unpopular as contrarianism can be we all need to ponder deeply about bob farrell s rule 4 exponentially rapidly rising or falling markets usually go further than you think but they do not correct by going sideways no one really knows how far up the top is but what happens after the top does not fit into very many people s risk tolerance in the meantime another year of double digit returns on the highest quality long duration bonds is our

continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content while i cannot pick the date i can tell you that this turbocharged debt cycle will end miserably not unlike 2008 and 2001 don t try to time the inevitable mean reversion trade just heed this first bob farrell rule of investing on mean reversion and know that it s out there in nearly 11 years the s p 500 has soared nearly fivefold to multiples on earnings sales and book value take your pick we have only seen twice in recent history there really is no reason to wait for the herd to head for the exits corporate bond spreads off treasuries are squeezed to levels that fall well short of compensating for imminent default risks and there really is no reason to wait for the herd to head for the exits that time will come sooner rather than later because mother nature will not tolerate leverage and multiple expansion supplanting corporate earnings and productivity growth indefinitely we recall all too well the euphoria that followed the early 2001 and late 2007 fed rate cuts and curve steepening shifts that then switched to malaise as the recession nobody saw coming took hold in the next few months the lags between monetary policy and the real economy are both long and variable we are still feeling the effects of the tightening in fed policy from 2015 2018 as we were feeling the 2004 06 effects by the time the 2008 recession kicked in advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content remember it cannot be denied that during the summer months the normalized new york fed recession probability model did breach the 80 per cent threshold and it cannot be taken back even if it has receded in response to the fed s recent liquidity infusions the fed has employed both actual rate cuts and an aggressive qe4 which in the past two months has more than fully funded the u s fiscal deficit but with a typical year long lag a recession has ensued after the 80 per cent mark has been crossed in the normalized new york fed model every single time in the past five decades and of course there are ongoing uncertainties around the global trade picture not to mention the u s fiscal outlook as it pertains to the november 2020 election i see little reason for a capex cycle to emerge in 2020 given the wide divide that has opened up on tax policy between the democrats and republicans to the point where even a centrist like joe biden is now campaigning on rolling back the trump tax cuts of 2018 what business is going to embark on a major multi year spending project not knowing what the after tax rate of return on the capital invested is going to look like advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content lately the equity market no longer seems to trade off the economic fundamentals never before has there been such a loose relationship to economic growth while the gdp recession never did materialize the median economic sector stopped expanding mid year and the portion of the economy that is not the consumer has posted no growth at all in the past three quarters that may well be a bit of data mining but it is to show how narrowly concentrated the economy has become not just that but corporate profits are set to be in a four quarter recession and investors have barely blinked more like shrugged at the start of 2019 the consensus was for a v shaped earnings recovery to take hold by year end but instead of double digit growth that the consensus had once penned in q4 2019 is now seen as coming in at 0 3 per cent on a yoy basis if corporate earnings had gone up four quarters in a row and the stock market plunged 30 per cent such a mismatch would make the temptation to turn bullish irresistible please stand by but what happened in 2019 was the exact opposite that was not in the consensus forecast at the turn of the year and the stock market soared by more than 30 per cent advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content so the market has rallied completely on the back of multiple expansion to the point where the price to earnings price to cash flow and price to book ratios are all near one standard deviations above their historical norms the price to sales multiple for the s p 500 actually is back to where it was at the 2000 dotcom bubble peak leveraged credits are in an eerily similar situation to what was surfacing out of the subprime mortgage market back in 2007 the ratio of corporate debt to gdp is at all time highs in addition to the unprecedented fiscal stimulus at this late stage of the economic cycle and accompanying trillion dollar deficits we also have corporate leverage ratios at record levels an enormous volume of corporate debt has been issued exclusively for the purpose of buying and retiring shares this includes both buybacks and acquisitions of other companies and in classic mature cycle fashion we are seeing some cracks emerge in the junkiest parts of the u s credit market this is an area to be focused on as leveraged credits are in an eerily similar situation to what was surfacing out of the subprime mortgage market back in 2007 in any event we are light years away from a stable equilibrium leverage financial engineering and the restructuring of the capital structure that followed the recent m a wave have become the defining features of this bull market in risk assets namely equities and corporate credit the proverbial canary in the coal mine usually resides somewhere in the credit market think of lbos in 1989 and subprime mortgages in 2007 advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the bottom line is that this is a stock market that is being driven by flows rather than by economic fundamentals the ongoing wave of stock buybacks has taken the s p 500 share count to two decade lows so to some extent the equity market now behaves more like a commodity this was achieved primarily by the issuance of low rated corporate debt in addition the baby boomer generation has done its best in a decade long effort to build retirement savings primarily in index fund purchases in their retirement plans this is the chinese year of the rat last year was the year of the pig and there was a whole cosmetics bag of lipstick that was applied primarily by central bankers there is just too much air underneath equity valuations and there is no room for credit spreads to tighten any further the world s economic and financial problems have been papered over by even more debt and we now have hit leverage ratios that look to be highly unstable and unsustainable in 2020 i smell a rat in 2020 i smell a rat the central bank liquidity taps are likely to be turned on even more but the impact at current valuation levels across the various risk asset classes will be far more muted now than was the case a year ago and there is always the prospect that the monetary authorities will stay on the sidelines and await a budgetary tax cut or government spending response which itself is futile given that fiscal policy in most countries is just as tapped out as monetary policy there are no easy solutions and it is doubtful that we will have another year where central banks can transform the weakest period for global economic growth in a decade and pull another rabbit out of the hat

gold price forecast bullish gold prices held up by low yields underlying unease about market outlook fed outlook in focus as powell testifies in congress cpi data is published baseline price support seen holding with surprise risk tilted to the upside gold prices have held up in a narrow 1536 1612 oz range since the beginning of the year even as other benchmark assets gyrated with swings in underlying sentiment this probably speaks to two sources of baseline support first interest rates around the world are ultra low relative to historical averages and there is seemingly little scope for them to rise in the near term that means the opportunity cost of owning a non interest bearing asset like the yellow metal is comparatively low second while the initial frenzy triggered discrete risks like military escalation between the us and iran or the wuhan coronavirus outbreak has ebbed an underlying sense of unease and uncertainty remains economic growth is recovering but has a long way to go before 2018 peaks are in sight meanwhile assorted risks like the us presidential election and the lingering possibility of a no deal brexit continue to stew in the background even as central banks fret about their depleted firepower the ecb tellingly launched a comprehensive review of its mandate for example powell testimony us cpi data to shape fed policy outlook the outlook for us monetary policy is likely to command the spotlight in the week ahead a steady stream of scheduled commentary from fomc officials will be headlined by fed chair jerome powell he is due on capitol hill for his semiannual testimony before committees of the house and senate mr powell seems likely to reassert the fed s preferred no change posture for the remainder of the year a word will no doubt be spared for as yet undefined risks like any drag from the wuhan virus on global growth but data dependence will probably be invoked against near term countervailing action recommended by ilya spivak get your free gold forecast get my guide on the data front january s cpi report is expected to show that headline inflation picked up to 2 4 percent on year however the core measure of underlying price growth excluding volatile food and energy costs is seen falling to a six month low at 2 2 percent on year benchmark food prices like those for wheat and rice rose alongside stocks in the fourth quarter as ebbing recession fears buoyed the demand outlook hitting multiyear highs by january at the same time crude oil price volatility surged as washington and tehran clashed the fed might be expected to look through such influences seeing them as relatively transitory in the context of its medium term target for price stability still a core cpi reading north of 2 percent seems comfortable enough for the central bank to remain in wait and see mode gold prices seen steady but upside surprise risk elevated on balance scheduled news flow seems to promise little that has scope to dislodge the underlying fundamental backdrop this probably limits scope for weakness meaningful progress to the upside will likely require one of the many potential risks in play to jump into the foreground for example if the coronavirus outbreak worsens or the outcome of the us presidential primary in new hampshire spooks the markets enough to bring down yields gold prices may rise in earnest perhaps most critically a surprise of this kind seems more likely than a similarly potent price negative alternative written by ilya spivak sr currency strategist for dailyfx com to contact ilya use the comments section below or ilyaspivak on twitter gold trading resources
dan hannan our constitutional practice needs to be updated french president emmanuel macron has told the european commission it must tie britain to eu rules forever during post brexit trade negotiations between the uk and brussels the telegraph reported yesterday france reportedly wants to toughen the bloc s negotiating stance for the trade talks and force britain to agree to dynamic alignment with eu rules for tax state aid the environment and social standards dynamic alignment means the uk would have to change its laws to mirror those in europe as they evolve over time despite the uk having no say in the drafting of those standards however on monday boris johnson made clear that britain will rule out making any level playing field guarantees and raised the prospect of the uk reverting to world trade organisation wto terms if eu chiefs refuse to sign off on a canada style free trade agreement many regard this as a nightmare scenario that could shrink the economy but former conservative mep daniel hannan painted a positive picture of leaving europe without a trade agreement in place in an interview with express co uk the brexiteer argued that the economic benefits that pushed britain to apply for membership in the first place were a myth he said the whole of europe did very well in the post war era more 1 of 1 663 print all in new window eu myth debunked why uk really joined eec prime minister boris johnson and there were lots of reasons for that there was migration from the countryside to the cities there was migration into europe there was free trade and of course there was a bounce back from the artificial low of world war 2 lots of infrastructure had been destroyed and factories had been bombed there was bound to be fast growth as people came back from that so the 30 years in continental europe that followed 1945 were a time of immense prosperity at least for the non communist countries less so for britain because frankly we had such a huge debt during world war 2 we had to spend the next 30 years inflating away by the seventies mr hannan added a lot of people in britain were hoping to swap the country s slow economic performance for the sustained and rapid growth enjoyed by most of the eec members and former prime minister edward heath sought belated entry just in peter shore s brilliant prophetic speech on brexit revealed subscribe invalid email we use your sign up to provide content in ways you ve consented to and to improve our understanding of you this may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding you can unsubscribe at any time more info ex conservative mep daniel hannan edward heath signing the accession treaty in 1972 however the conservative politician noted we couldn t have got our timing more spectacularly wrong after those amazing three decades of growth the continental european economies slowed down severely and after the oil shock never really recovered and at just that moment the commonwealth began to take off the uk switched forces just as the commonwealth was beginning to grow mr hannan s comments were echoed by alan sked emeritus professor of international history at london school of economics and founder of ukip who also claimed that the eec was in no position to aid anyone s economies in the sixties and seventies he wrote in a 2016 report the eec spent most of its meagre resources on agriculture and fisheries and had no policies at all for furthering economic growth if europe grew after 1945 growth was kick started by ludwig erhard s currency and supply side reforms in west germany from 1948 which in turn revitalised the economies of the low countries don t miss real reason labour went from being most eurosceptic party to pro eu how spain crushed snp s hopes for smooth eu membership lord owen blames mcdonnell not corbyn for labour s embarrassing defeat professor alan sked trending
washington ap u s hiring jumped last month and many more people were encouraged to look for work showing that the economy remains robust despite threats from china s viral outbreak an ongoing trade war and struggles at boeing the strong job growth gives president donald trump more evidence for his assertion that the economy is flourishing under his watch it may also complicate the argument his democratic presidential rivals are making that the economy isn t benefiting everyday americans the labor department said friday that employers added a robust 225 000 jobs in january at the same time a half million americans feeling better about their job prospects streamed into the job market most found jobs but those that didn t were newly counted as unemployed and their numbers raised the jobless rate to 3 6 from december s half century low of 3 5 seven democratic presidential candidates were to debate later friday in new hampshire leading contenders notably sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built campaigns around the argument that the middle class has been mostly left out of an economic expansion that has disproportionately served the wealthy the outcome of the presidential race could hinge in part on whether enough voters agree that inequality and rising costs for services such as health care housing and college education outweigh the benefits from nearly 11 years of economic growth democratic primary voters are very open to messages about the economy doing badly said jason furman a top economic adviser to former president barack obama said furman added though i don t know that that would be consistent for the electorate as a whole as the election intensifies views of the economy remain broadly polarized according to a pew research center survey released friday 81 of republicans and republican leaning independents say the economy is excellent or good only 39 of democrats and those leaning democratic say so the public overall pew notes holds a more positive view of the economy than at any point in the past 20 years fifty seven percent say they think it is excellent or good up from 32 in 2016 trump and his team can point to several positive trends in friday s jobs report though his democratic opponents can cite some evidence for their contrasting views too robust hiring has picked up from earlier this year when the trade war with china raged and is helping remedy one of the economy s key weaknesses even as the unemployment rate fell from a peak of 10 in 2009 millions of americans were discouraged about finding a job and stopped looking for one some returned to school or stayed home to care for relatives yet that trend has nearly reversed itself since 2016 the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who either have a job or are looking for one has reached its highest point since september 2008 just before the recession intensified economists typically focus on the prime age population because it filters out the effects of retirement among the vast baby boomer generation trump officials are also stressing that the job market is now benefiting a wider range of demographic groups we have seen hispanics african americans asians young people women all are either at their all time employment lows or very nearly so larry kudlow the white house s top economic adviser said friday trump has also been touting a blue collar boom though the evidence for that is mixed manufacturers lost jobs in january for the third time in four months the employment report shows that if there is such a boom it is among construction and transportation and warehouse workers who accounted for nearly one third of last month s hiring these jobs often pay less than factory jobs of the past wages are also a mixed bag hourly pay rose 3 1 in january from a year earlier a decent pace but below a peak of 3 5 reached last summer the last time the unemployment rate fell below 4 in the late 1990s wages were rising much faster about 4 5 annually still pay is picking up for many low income workers a trend that trump has repeatedly pointed to for the poorest one quarter of workers wages rose 4 6 year over year in december the most recent month for which data is available compared with 3 for the richest quarter according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta those outsize gains began in 2015 and have been fueled in part by higher minimum wages in many states yet there are many soft spots in the economy that democrats can work with furman said for example a congressional budget office report in december concluded that trump s 2017 tax cuts disproportionately benefited wealthy americans the cbo a nonpartisan institution forecasts that the richest 1 of americans will enjoy roughly triple the gains in after tax income compared with the bottom fifth nor has the economy s growth reversed long running wealth disparities federal reserve data shows the top 1 owned more than 32 of the nation s housing and financial wealth up slightly from when trump was inaugurated despite the economic strength evident in friday s job report analysts warn that hiring could slow in the coming months january

washington dc feb 7 2020 u s job growth accelerated in january with unseasonably mild temperatures boosting hiring in weather sensitive sectors indicating the economy will probably continue to grow moderately despite a deepening slump in business investment the labor department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday however showed the economy created 514 000 fewer jobs between april 2018 and march 2019 than originally estimated the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12 month period since 2009 took some of the shine from the employment report which also showed a pickup in wage gains strong job creation and firming wage growth in january provided reassurance that the record long economic expansion still has room to run said lydia boussour a senior u s economist at oxford economics in new york but this latest health report also points to a maturing labor market benchmark revisions indicate this labor market isn t as youthful as it has pretended to be over the last two years nonfarm payrolls increased by 225 000 jobs last month with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder than normal temperatures the government s survey of establishments showed there were also strong gains in hiring in the transportation and warehousing industry economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 160 000 jobs in january data for november and december was revised to show 7 000 more jobs created than previously reported job growth in january exceeded the monthly average of 175 000 in 2019 employment gains averaged 193 000 in 2018 payrolls growth is expected to slow in february as the coronavirus which has killed hundreds in china and infected thousands globally disrupts supply chains especially for technology companies such as apple the annual benchmark revisions to payrolls could attract attention amid concerns the labor department s bureau of labor statistics which compiles the employment data may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of president donald trump s 19 month trade war with china which has contributed to the longest downturn in business investment since 2009 the downward revision in the level of employment suggests the government s birth death model which it uses to calculate the net number of jobs from new business and closings is faulty economists say payrolls have tended to be overstated when the trend in growth is weakening they say the downward revisions could impact financial markets assessments of the labor market job gains in february 2019 were slashed down to 1 000 from the originally estimated 56 000 the slowdown in job growth is blamed on worker shortages and ebbing demand for labor even though employment growth has slowed the pace remains well above the 100 000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population u s stock indexes were trading lower while prices of u s treasuries were higher the dollar dxy was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies wages edge up the government also introduced updated population estimates to its smaller household survey data including employment and labor force participation the unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey the jobless rate rose one tenth of a percentage point to 3 6 in january a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment increased to 6 9 from 6 7 in december which was the lowest since the series started in 1994 the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one rose two tenths of a percentage point to 63 4 last month the highest since june 2013 the tightening labor market is steadily driving up wages average hourly earnings increased seven cents or 0 2 last month after gaining 0 1 in december that lifted the annual increase in wages to 3 1 in january from 3 0 in december the average workweek was 34 3 hours for a third straight month in january federal reserve chair jerome powell said last month the united states low labor force participation relative to those of other advanced economies represents more labor supply and it may be holding down wages this report will embolden the fed to let the labor market run hot on the assumption that there is more hidden slack and the assessment that wage gains are only moderate said conrad dequadros senior economic advisor at brean capital in new york still wage growth is probably enough to support a decent pace of consumer spending and keep the economy chugging along the economy grew 2 3 in 2019 the slowest performance in three years after logging 2 9 growth in 2018 growth this year is seen around 2 just above the 1 8 that economists say is the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation the construction industry added 44 000 jobs in january the largest since january 2019 after payrolls increased by 11 000 in december employment in the transportation and warehousing industry accelerated by 28 000 driven by gains in the hiring of couriers and messengers payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 36 000 jobs healthcare and social assistance employment rose by 47 200 jobs there were also increases in hiring in the professional and business services and wholesale trade industries but manufacturing employment declined by 12 000 jobs after falling by 5 000 in december the industry has been the hardest hit by the u s china trade war though washington and beijing signed a phase 1 trade deal last month u s tariffs on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total remained in place manufacturing is also being squeezed by boeing s suspension last month of production of its troubled 737 max jetliner boeing s biggest supplier spirit aerosystems holdings inc said last month it planned to lay off more than 20 of the workforce at its facility in wichita kansas because of the 737 max production suspension the mining and logging industry added no jobs last month while retail payrolls dropped 8 300 further job losses are likely as macy s announced layoffs and closures this week government payrolls rose by 19 000 jobs in january with some hiring for the 2020 decennial

expand ken jones liberal democracy is in crisis not because the masses have suddenly become illiberal as some claim but because economic elites have abandoned any pretense of concern for the common good after the fall of the berlin wall thirty years ago liberal democracy reigned triumphant understood as one person one vote exercised in periodic elections constitutional rights and a market economy democracy spread around the world today the liberal democratic compact appears to be breaking down democracy we often hear is in crisis recent research reveals that democracy defined by the preceding attributes has weakened worldwide over the last decade or so according to one well respected annual report seventy one countries suffered net declines in political rights and civil liberties in 2017 leading to an overall decrease in global freedom democracy continues its disturbing retreat the economist warned in early 2018 not long after the magazine s yearly democracy index officially downgraded the united states from a full democracy to a flawed one democracy however doesn t retreat either of its own accord or by some organic or immutable process it is undermined attacked or allowed to wither it falls into disrepair and disrepute thanks to the action or inaction of human beings who have lost touch with or in some cases sabotaged the tenets responsibilities and possibilities that a system of self government entails in order to determine what a progressive agenda to repair and revitalize democracy should be we need to understand what has gone awry unfortunately conventional narratives too often get things wrong consider for example the common refrain that populism is to blame for our current predicament we live in a populist moment pundits including yascha mounk tell us and brexit the rise of ethno nationalist parties in europe india and brazil and the election of donald trump all lend credence to this view under this view the crisis of democracy is caused in effect by an excess of democracy such was the premise of a piece published in new york magazine in 2016 by andrew sullivan who argued that hyperdemocratic society was eroding vital barriers between the popular will and the exercise of power regular people we are told can t be trusted to appreciate and protect democratic principles and procedures progressives need to push back against this explanatory framework in contrast to what alexis de tocqueville long ago dubbed the tyranny of the majority the threat today comes from a tyrannical minority hard won democratic reforms are being eroded by an entitled affluent elite who are doing their utmost to stymie progressive reforms and suppress broadly shared democratic sentiments in 2016 the majority of american voters preferred a democratic president but they were blocked by the outdated electoral college today six in ten u s adults believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases but the u s supreme court may soon decide otherwise and overturn roe vs wade research by data for progress and others shows that liberal positions on everything from labor unions to gun control to public health care to the climate catastrophe and the green new deal are held by the majority of americans with positions generally pushing further left the younger the demographic polled and yet time and again the american people s progressive policy preferences are ignored the will of the progressive majority subverted the national agenda studies show is set by oligarchs and well organized special interests the rest of us have virtually no impact on public policy hard won democratic reforms are being eroded by an entitled affluent elite who are doing their utmost to stymie progressive reforms and suppress broadly shared democratic sentiments liberal democracy is in crisis not because the masses have suddenly become illiberal as some claim but because economic elites have abandoned any pretense of concern for the common good this is the true crisis of democracy and it is a problem with deep roots the inequalities that plague us today are not an aberration or the result of whichever party happens to be in power but a logical consequence of our political system s initial constitutional design which aimed to benefit a privileged minority namely propertied white men if democracy is to survive and thrive this country s foundational inequities must finally be redressed to do that we must be clear the primary threat facing democracy today is not one of populism but rather plutocracy the solution involves putting equality political and economic equality at the center of the democratic project over the course of human history democracy sprung up in all sorts of places and times taking a variety of forms citizen assemblies in the ancient middle eastern city of nippur the mesoamerican collective republic of tlaxcalla african village councils the icelandic althing swiss cantons and so on the ancient greeks in other words did not invent the practice of democracy but they did give us the word we use today one made up of two component parts demos and kratos the people hold power in the fifth century b c the celebrated athenian statesman pericles famously praised the political structure of athens it is true that we are called a democracy for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few given the existence of slavery and the exclusion of women athens failed to meet the bar by modern standards yet as plato and aristotle noted the overwhelming majority of people who made up the athenian demos were not wealthy rule of the people they observed by definition means rule of the poor since citizens of modest means are bound to vastly outnumber the rich this basic insight has been negated in our time as neoliberal capitalism and the massive financial inequities it creates dismantle hard won democratic gains as historian quinn slobodian has shown one of the primary goals of neoliberalism is to insulate economic matters and financial decision makers from democratic accountability to cleave economics from politics the result has been a system where markets not people rule and where a lucky few amass almost unfathomable affluence today three billionaires bill gates jeff bezos and warren buffett possess as much wealth as more than half of all other americans combined year upon year the vast majority of the income generated globally flows into the pockets of the top 1 percent of the world s population while the incomes of ordinary citizens have remained stagnant if the last fifty years have demonstrated anything it is that formal political equality exemplified by the right to vote is not enough to ensure democracy as the wealthy have many avenues to exert disproportionate power within an ostensibly democratic system under a legal order where money qualifies as speech in the context of campaign spending and lobbying the richest are able to purchase influence while everyone else struggles to be heard in a system where the affluent can pass their assets to their offspring virtually untaxed inherited wealth ensures the creation of an aristocratic class the single most urgent and overarching priority of any progressive democratic agenda must be to address this conundrum while earlier generations focused on expanding suffrage today we face an arguably more formidable task saving democracy from capitalism extending democracy from the political to the economic sphere is the great challenge of our age and also the only way to protect our current system of representative government from the concentrated financial power that is proving to be its undoing political equality buttressed by economic equality must be the basis of any truly democratic system the greeks for all their shortcomings understood this basic fact and they employed a variety of ingenious strategies to prevent wealthy individuals from dominating their poorer counterparts for example it was illegal to profit from politics in athens going further still poor citizens were actually paid to participate in public affairs receiving a day s wage for attendance at the assembly so farmers and artisans could afford to leave their fields and workshops and deliberate alongside the well to do even more creatively athenians employed sortition the random selection of citizens through lottery for key roles in the city s administration because they observed rightfully that the rich and well born tended to win elections elections are aristocratic aristotle famously observed lottery democratic for the greeks democracy meant to govern and be governed in turn thus working citizens had to have meaningful opportunities to get involved in civic life and that meant accounting for and addressing underlying material inequalities while earlier generations focused on expanding suffrage today we face an arguably more formidable task saving democracy from capitalism if athenians somehow landed in contemporary washington d c they would be aghast that the average congressperson is a millionaire while their constituents largely struggle to make ends meet they would be appalled that it is legal for private interests to make financial contributions to politicians and that those very public officials are allowed to leave office to work for the same companies that donated to their campaigns finally they would scoff at the idea that elections are widely regarded as democracy s apex with such a limited conception of democracy guiding us they would be dismayed but not surprised we have a self proclaimed billionaire serving in the white house and a couple others vying for their chance to run the show as any regular reader of the progressive likely knows this is an age of intersecting emergencies racism and xenophobia precarity and poverty workplace discrimination unaffordable housing unaccountable corporate power mass incarceration mounting student debt mass extinction and rising sea levels the list goes on in one way or another all these issues relate back to the fact that we do not live in a system where democratic popular will can be translated into policy change that is efficiently and effectively implemented to have any hope of addressing this disconnect we need an agenda that connects the political and economic spheres and a strategy for building popular power we must seek to democratize our electoral system and economy and by doing so loosen the grip of monied elites and corporate interests on our lives and futures on the electoral front we can take inspiration from the past like the ancient athenians we must work to protect our democratic processes from the corrosive impact of wealth this should include getting money out of politics publicly financing elections and eliminating all barriers to voting which disproportionately impact poor voters especially people of color instead of one person one vote our motto must be one person one equally meaningful vote our current arrangement which weights votes based on geography is deeply undemocratic giving older whiter more conservative voters a substantial advantage and entrenching minority rule a problem exacerbated when republicans control the redistricting process we need to restructure our democracy and move away from our winner take all system to a more proportional model on the economic front reducing inequality must be a priority we should do this by lifting the wage floor but also imposing a maximum wage in 1942 president franklin d roosevelt proposed precisely this asking congress to approve a 100 percent top tax rate that would have capped people s after tax income at what amounted to just under 400 000 in today s dollars congress compromised raising the tax rate to 94 percent on all income in excess of 200 000 abolish billionaires has become a political slogan among young lefties it would also be smart policy closing the obscene gulf between the rich and the poor however is only the first step we must also address issues of ownership and investment working people not just the wealthy should have a stake in the companies that employ them and everyone should have a voice in determining investment indeed that is the only way to rationally allocate capital right now corporate ceos and shareholders are determined to prioritize the extraction of ecosystem destroying fossil fuels or the creation of advertising driven privacy violating digital platforms even if they have devastating implications for the environment and for public discourse democratizing the economy giving workers and the public as a whole more of a say would mean we could invest in the things we all need like solar energy and investigative journalism not just the things that make a handful of people rich the task ahead is urgent we need to roll back half a century of neoliberal austerity and restore the democratic rights that have been undermined but we must also reimagine democracy itself setting our sights on a more robust inclusive and egalitarian system than has ever existed a growing number of people are doing just that galvanized by social movements occupy wall street black lives matter and nodapl to name a few and the rise of figures such as senator bernie sanders and congresswomen alexandria ocasio cortez and rashida tlaib the phrase democratic socialism is emerging as the name for this new political horizon remarkably a majority of young americans report preferring socialism to capitalism this in the country that brought the world coca cola walmart and facebook putting their ideas into action they are getting involved in electoral campaigns across the country democratic socialists have contested and won seats at the state and municipal level from california to georgia running on bold policies such as universal health care and a green new deal democratic socialists understand that we have to engage the system as it is while also working to transform it they also know that the question of political equality cannot be separated from the question of economic equality this emerging insurgency is democracy s best hope only by building on these vital campaigns nationally and locally will we have any hope of advancing a democratic agenda that lives up to its name that is to say a society in which the people not the plutocrats rule this piece was supported by a puffin foundation economic hardship reporting project fellowship
detroit free press mi feb 8 washington since her daughter gabbie was born 16 years ago sarah may has had to balance work against caring for a daughter with disorders that cause seizures and force her to use a wheelchair it hasn t been easy but may a 37 year old bartender in white lake sees the two of them as lucky they have medicaid which has covered what she estimates would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and could have meant financial ruin i ve never once had to sit and just be oh my god this is the fourth doctor s appointment in two weeks how am i going to afford this she said others may not be as fortunate which is why may a democrat in what traditionally has been a mostly republican part of michigan is supporting what is known as single payer a government run health care plan paid for by taxes covering all americans linking your entire family s health and well being to a job where a boss can do anything to you because you re afraid to lose your health care that s wrong said may referring to the 157 million americans who have coverage through their jobs while many if not most democrats agree with may s sentiment support for the remedy is far from universal however among the democratic candidates running for president there is a split between those like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren who want a government plan for everyone and others including joe biden pete buttigieg and mike bloomberg who aren t ready to embrace proposals to take private plans and employer provided coverage away from people who want to keep them ahead of the state s march 10 primary it s a question splitting michiganders as well a recent survey of 600 michigan voters done by the glengariff group of lansing for the detroit regional chamber of commerce found just one in five supported single payer which has also come to be known as medicare for all though it has nothing to do with medicare the popular government plan covering 44 million older americans that s compared with 36 who prefer a more widely available medicare like option that would leave private insurance and other plans available under the federal affordable care act otherwise known as obamacare in place biden buttigieg and others are promoting that type of plan there are major differences between the two a single payer plan would totally revamp the whole health care system and how it s paid for guaranteeing coverage but upending long standing practices and shifting costs in ways that might seem beneficial to some and not to others a public option seems more modest but it represents a major shift as well with government tax resources and the power of the law behind it becoming a direct competitor with commercial insurers for customers some see it as a backdoor to a single payer plan over time and both could cost plenty more than 30 of the michiganders polled for the survey believe nothing should be done or only modest tweaks be made to the aca but it s the debate between medicare for all and medicare for those who want it that is central to the democratic primary fight and the area where candidates have the sharpest differences on a topic that voters routinely say is one of their top concerns among those polled who identified as leaning democratic support for the medicare like option beat that for a single payer plan 46 27 among those michiganders who consider themselves staunch democrats meanwhile 51 said they favor the option compared with 23 who favor the one government plan once voters understand that going to a medicare for all system means they would lose the plans they have now that they are by and large happy with their support goes away pretty quickly said brad williams vice president of governmental affairs for the detroit regional chamber but that hasn t stopped many self described democrats like may from supporting a single government plan believing that maybe if everyone had the same comprehensive coverage she wouldn t have to worry that every time an official looking letter comes that someone is going to make her justify her daughter s coverage and make her recite again her list of disabilities sometimes i m so nervous to open an envelope from the state of michigan i let it sit for weeks before i do she said becoming emotional you have to say everything that is wrong with your kid you spend so much time fighting for them to be recognized for the good things about them you try to teach people she can t help her disabilities that it s not her fault but then the paperwork comes and you have to write down every single thing that s wrong with her voices like hers are among the loudest in the democratic primary fight there has been sniping among the democratic candidates on the issue for months especially between the front runners particularly sanders and biden with the former complaining a public option isn t a drastic enough change to substantially improve access to coverage and stop profit gouging and the latter saying a single payer plan is a political pipe dream going too far for people who are happy with their coverage and costing too much money the truth is both may be right the 5 questions to ask about any health care proposal no one who has dealt with health insurance needs to be told that it s complicated depending on your circumstances your age your job the medical conditions you have or might develop there are a universe of options all potentially costing different amounts with different premiums and deductibles medicare is the primary backstop for older americans medicaid for lower income citizens or people with disabilities employer sponsored coverage is widespread but far from ubiquitous and still comes with questions about how much it costs and what it covers and which doctors you can go to coverage on the individual market meaning for those without government or employer sponsored coverage is available through exchanges set up by the aca which also requires insurance to cover all pre existing conditions and sets caps on spending but also has been targeted for repeal by republicans and has its own issues with the cost of coverage subsidies to help lower income recipients pay their costs and availability there are also legal challenges intent on having it overturned if you consider health care costs or access a problem to be solved begin with this it s a tough nut to crack no matter how you want to do it the aca for instance significantly reduced the number of uninsured people in the u s from about 44 million in 2013 the year before it took effect to about 27 million in 2017 but health care costs are still accelerating with total costs expected to grow by more than 5 5 a year over the next decade premiums and deductibles are climbing for people covered under aca and employer sponsored plans a lot of that is because of government spending on medicaid and medicare especially as baby boomers continue to move into retirement but prescription drug prices hospital costs and other factors are expected to drive increases as well so how to solve it linda blumberg a health care expert who has written extensively about the various democratic proposals for the urban institute a washington d c research group proposes that anyone setting out to understand them should start with five questions 1 is it available at the same price to everyone regardless of their health condition 2 how generous are government subsidies to help pay premiums and other costs 3 should payments to doctors hospitals drugmakers and others be regulated 4 how important is it that everyone including undocumented immigrants be covered 5 how do you pay for it those factors are incredibly tricky to balance so in the october 2019 report blumberg and others at the urban institute helped write they made several assumptions and came up with figures that made headlines working through eight different options ranging from providing more financial help to families on the aca to various forms of public options all the way to a generous single payer plan they found the most modest changes are the most affordable costing government perhaps 26 billion more a year but leaving tens of millions without coverage depending how it s structured a public option could result in just about universal coverage but could cost as much as 162 billion a year or more if undocumented immigrants are included it could be less however if it wasn t made available to those who have employer sponsored plans a generous comprehensive single payer plan could cost as much as 2 9 trillion a year though like the others it could result in savings for many households while costing others more the democratic candidates are looking at various ways of paying for their plans but they all come down to either shifting costs through payroll and other corporate taxes to be paid by employers and adding taxes designed to mostly hit wealthy people such as instituting capital gains taxes and increasing income brackets on the highest earners biden for instance would increase to 39 6 the top income tax bracket for people making more than 500 000 annually warren has proposed a tax equal to 2 on any assets worth more than 50 million and 6 on assets worth above 1 billion there are also questions whether those various programs will raise all the money the candidates say they will and the urban institute s report is not the only one out there about possible effects though it is one of the most cited by experts but before anyone gets to ultimately deciding how much money is needed you have to answer blumberg s questions and it s hard to do so say you think all americans should be covered regardless of age or condition but you also want health care overall to be no more costly than the current system and you want to keep out of pocket costs down maybe decrease them for poor and middle class people that means you have to try to increase taxes on wealthy people or spread them out broadly implement some other sort of cost sharing for a larger section of the population limit benefits or sharply limit payments to health care providers or some mix of those three but each is extremely difficult politically and is likely to remain so add other questions such as whether undocumented immigrants should be covered or receive subsidies and whether abortion services should be covered it gets even tougher unsurprisingly insurers warn against such plans one group last year said even the somewhat more modest public option could lead to higher taxes and premiums while destabilizing the insurance markets millions of americans depend on for their coverage but other countries have such systems after all despitedisadvantages such as long waiting times for procedures the sheer cost placed on taxpayers and the availability of care there s a consensus though that the u s overall pays more per capita for health care than most other industrialized countries that have nationalized health plans blumberg said there is no reason a satisfactory health care system can t be designed but it s a matter of how it is developed whether there is widespread support for what it does and how to finance it and if the political will exists to make changes when they become necessary to improve it all of these are trade offs she said there is no heaven on earth with health care it s all a series of trade offs just how modest is the middle of the road option the public option is touted as the less disruptive choice the politically possible choice the idea itself is pretty simple you create a medicare like insurance option that s available to everyone to compete with private insurance plans by using the government s ability to force health care providers drugmakers and others to accept certain rates for payment consumers would be given a choice that in theory would push other commercial plans to renegotiate their own payment schedules give up some profits and lower premiums and deductibles to remain competitive that in turn could help slow overall health care costs there are lots of questions though people taking the public option would still have to pay for it and no one s sure exactly what those premiums and deductibles would look like since that would depend on who signed up their health care status and financial condition and how government underwrote it but there would be government subsidies available for lower income individuals and families just like on obamacare typically the proposals for a public option also call for changes to be made to the aca that would increase the number of families in the u s eligible for government subsidies and lowering their out of pocket costs in some ways said tom buchmueller a health economist at the university of michigan ross school of business those proposals could have even more immediate impact than the public option by strengthening a system that already covers nearly 275 000 michiganders with another 674 000 state residents on healthy michigan the medicaid expansion plan created under the aca as well as a practical matter it would be much easier to tweak the parameters of the obamacare system to expand coverage there are real advantages to building on that system he said but in a go big or go home kind of primary year it seems as if the starting point for all the major democratic candidates is at the very least the public option arguing it will help support the aca increasing coverage options and lowering costs while allowing americans to keep the insurance they already have if they want it they also argue it won t require the wholesale change a single payer system would a point some voters have picked up on susan anzicek 62 of brighton thinks back to the surgeries she underwent when she was suffering from breast cancer remembering one that cost some 70 000 and all the bills covered by her insurance she thinks that while it might be ideal to have one health care system for everyone it may not be realistic to ask the majority of americans to embrace such a drastic change the psyche of the world we live is wanting choices and not being dictated to do only one thing she said i just think it s too big of a pill to swallow she s supporting a public option lots and lots of people favor the public option last november the kaiser family foundation a health care research group in washington ran a nationwide poll that found 65 of the 1 205 adults surveyed supported such a plan compared with about 50 support for a medicare for all single payer plan but it also has its critics insurance companies and many republicans argue the public option sets up a phony competition since government in theory has the legal tools and financial resources they don t have they say that over time it will result in the public option becoming a de facto single payer program as people migrate their coverage to it that in turn would put insurance companies out of business that s a possible scenario one some democrats have even applauded warren would put in place public options first to transition to a single payer plan recognizing that such a plan could serve as an interim step toward a unified government health insurance plan but even the most thought out public option plans leave many questions about coverage and costs unanswered and that s if it could somehow be approved in a still divided congress which is unlikely as it stands now if however it were set up in such a way where it had a more limited coverage package say as a way perhaps to keep costs down it could potentially leave room for private insurers to compete against it for some critics the problem with the public option is that it doesn t go far enough in the urban institute report a public option albeit one that isn t available to people with employer sponsored insurance would bring the number of uninsured down to about 21 million people which is still a far cry from universal coverage making enrollment automatic and opening it up to people with employer sponsored plans brings that down significantly further but may not cover everyone it would still cost government meaning taxpayers between 50 billion and about 160 billion a year depending on how it s structured but then it would also potentially save households between 18 billion and 57 billion a year and employers between 14 billion and 97 billion total at the same time according to the urban institute s figures some of those savings would presumably go to pay for the program though again who paid what would have to be determined the urban institute did not look at the funding proposals put forward by the candidates but critics including sanders say plans like these maintain the status quo and while that s a difficult position to defend since almost everyone sees a widely available public option as a huge change in the way insurance coverage is delivered sanders argues it doesn t do enough to take profits out of the health care business the day has got to come sanders said during a december 2019 debate in los angeles when we finally say to the drug companies and the insurance companies the function of health care is to provide it for all of our people in a cost effective way not to make massive profits biden and other supporters of a public option however don t believe supporters of single payer are being honest about the cost and what that change would mean the dubious simplicity of a single payer system single payer medicare for all whatever you want to call a system where the federal government effectively runs one massive insurance plan that covers every american has many things going for it for one it s simple to understand everybody s covered for another if conceived as a plan where commercial insurance no longer exists and it s presumably fair everyone regardless of income age or any other demographic gets the same insurance there s no buying extra plans to cover what isn t covered because the plans being promoted are largely comprehensive sanders plan for instance would be more generous than most of those offered by other nations with national health care and more generous than most employer sponsored plans with no premiums and no deductibles the only out of pocket cost would be on prescription drugs but behind such a proposal and any proposal for single payer care are a couple of major issues the first would be the cost the second would be how to pay for that cost on the issue of cost buchmueller is among those who speculate whether a health care system that doesn t have more cost sharing might encourage people to use more health care services than they need and it s long been believed that letting people use as much health care as they want stretches resources and pushes overall costs and spending up having some cost sharing is probably a good thing to remind people this isn t free he said and while a comprehensive benefits package is desirable it comes with a steep price for instance blumberg and her colleagues estimated in a report last october that a comprehensive single payer plan without cost sharing could cost the federal government an additional 32 trillion over a decade currently the congressional budget office expects all federal spending under current law to be about 60 trillion over the next 10 years it s a lot of money but the argument is that households and employers would save money they spend now on coverage still the cost would have to be covered somehow sanders has proposed a system of payroll taxes on employers higher taxes on wealthy people and other measures warren would have businesses effectively pay most of what they are already paying to the government to cover the plan and increase other taxes on wealthy people to make up the difference but there are also questions as to what it means long term blumberg for example has estimated that national health care spending overall would go up by some 8 trillion over 10 years compared to current spending under a comprehensive single payer plan and getting from the system we have now to single payer would be enormously disruptive with payments to hospitals and doctors being revamped tax structures changing to move money from one place to another and systems being put in place to make sure that no one fell

many medical issues but still has developmental issues both are covered by medicaid like sarah may staggs speaking for herself and not little lobbyists wants everyone to get the care they need and not have to worry about it and is concerned that a public option leaves in place commercial interests and profit motives that to her mind hurt families but she warned this is a huge rock to move it has to be deliberate it has to be well tested we have to ensure that not one single person is adversely affected when we make this change the political reality is it s unlikely to occur anytime soon critics of sanders and warren s plans like biden buttigieg and others have questioned whether sanders warren and others backing a single payer plan are being straight with the american people suggesting that any generous and comprehensive plan is probably going to cost middle class taxpayers more than they are letting on supporters of single payer have said the middle class won t pay any more than they do now the critics could be right certainly other countries have at times had to deal with finding money to make up shortfalls in their health care systems a more generous program might require more in taxes in order to be funded or need to be scaled back raising taxes on wealthy people sounds to many like a solution but the political reality is that may be tough to sustain and when it comes to campaign promises they often bend to other realities president donald trump not only said he d build a wall across the southern border he d get mexico to pay for it and that hasn t happened president barack obama when he was a candidate for president argued against mandating that every american have insurance or pay a penalty only to embrace it as part of the eventual coverage policy that many use his name to describe i don t think that was necessarily negative said buchmueller speaking of obama s comments things change but it s fair to wonder whether the political reality of the democrats health care proposals is more along the lines of insisting mexico would pay for the wall along the u s border or arguing over an important though realistic policy matter it s likely more the former than the latter the affordable care act passed by the slimmest of margins during the fallout of the great recession with obama in the white house democrats in charge of the u s house and having briefly a filibuster proof majority in the senate still compromises had to be made and still it set off a political fight that is being fought a decade later at present democrats look like they may retain control of the house in this year s elections but republicans hold 53 seats in the 100 member senate and while it s possible they could take back the majority to do so they will have to beat several incumbents in colorado arizona maine or elsewhere while holding on to their own seats in states like michigan even then getting to a 60 vote margin needed to overcome a filibuster is all but impossible in 2020 some argue the debate is the wrong one to be having at all doug holtz eakin a former director of the congressional budget office who now heads the american action forum which does economic policy research from the center right political perspective believes it should be simpler to figure out ways to get the 15 million or so people who are currently eligible for coverage through the aca medicaid expansion or their employers but don t have it to get it without upending the existing health care system and while single payer is dramatic he said it doesn t solve the problem of lowering health care costs to get at costs you have to do something that s really unpopular holtz eakin said hospitals have to make less and doctors have to make less democrats may have an edge on republicans on the question of health care he acknowledged but they could also squander it the things you re hearing from the democrats are either fantasyland or they are politically attractive empty promises holtz eakin said and none of them solves the real problem contact todd spangler follow him on twitter tsspangler read more on michigan politics and sign up for our elections newsletter ___ c

contenders notably sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built campaigns around the argument that the middle class has been mostly left out of an economic expansion that has disproportionately served the wealthy the outcome of the presidential race could hinge in part on whether enough voters agree that inequality and rising costs for services such as health care housing and college education outweigh the benefits from nearly 11 years of economic growth democratic primary voters are very open to messages about the economy doing badly said jason furman a top economic adviser to former president barack obama said furman added though i don t know that that would be consistent for the electorate as a whole as the election intensifies views of the economy remain broadly polarized according to a pew research center survey released friday 81 of republicans and republican leaning independents say the economy is excellent or good only 39 of democrats and those leaning

their contrasting views too robust hiring has picked up from earlier this year when the trade war with china raged and is helping remedy one of the economy s key weaknesses even as the unemployment rate fell from a peak of 10 in 2009 millions of americans were discouraged about finding a job and stopped looking for one some returned to school or stayed home to care for relatives yet that trend has nearly reversed itself since 2016 the proportion of americans in their prime working years ages 25 through 54 who either have a job or are looking for one has reached its highest point since

americans asians young people women all are either at their all time employment lows or very nearly so larry kudlow the white house s top economic adviser said friday trump has also been touting a blue collar boom though the evidence for that is mixed manufacturers lost jobs in january for the third time in four months the employment report shows that if there is such a boom it is among construction and transportation and warehouse workers who accounted for nearly one third of last month s hiring these jobs often pay less than factory jobs of the past wages are also a mixed bag hourly pay rose 3 1 in january from a year earlier a decent pace but below a peak of 3 5 reached last summer the last time the unemployment rate fell below 4 in the late 1990s wages were rising much faster about 4 5 annually still pay is picking up for many low income workers a trend that trump has repeatedly pointed to for the poorest one quarter of workers wages rose 4 6 year over year in december the most recent month for which data is available compared with 3 for the richest quarter according to the federal reserve bank of atlanta those outsize gains began in 2015 and have been fueled in part by higher minimum wages in many states yet there are many soft spots in the economy that democrats can work with furman said for example a congressional budget office report in december

investment income a related issue is should investment income such as dividends capital gains and carried interest be taxed at a lower rate than labor income currently investment income is taxed at a top rate of 20 as opposed to the 37 tax on labor income with other rate differentials at lower incomes the democratic candidates all want to end the practice of taxing investment income at a lower rate than labor income i believe there are good reasons to do so as do many other economists primarily a lower tax rate incentivizes the wealthy to find ways to convert earnings from labor into capital income to reduce their tax bill and believe it or not private equity managers who typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year have all their earnings classified as capital income cutting their tax bill in half ap photo patrick semansky corporate income tax the 2017 trump tax bill also cut corporate taxes from 35 to 21 with proponents arguing it would spur business investment and economic growth several studies however found little or no evidence of this impact and the 2017 tax bill reduced corporate tax revenues as a share of gdp to 1 1 from the 50 year average of 1 9 putting a larger proportion of the tax burden on individuals this is why all the democratic candidates propose raising corporate tax rates some such as former vice president joe biden and minnesota sen amy klobuchar want to raise the rate some while others such as mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren would restore the pre trump 35 rate similar to the individual tax finding the optimal corporate tax rate can be tricky generally speaking changes to corporate taxes have little impact on the u s economy so raising them shouldn t slow growth higher corporate taxes do however reduce stock prices since corporations will pay more money to the government and less to shareholders as dividends thereby reducing incentives to own stock shares this can hurt less wealthy americans with investments in retirement plans and mutual funds a wealth tax sens sanders and warren argue the super wealthy should pay even higher taxes to reduce inequality and to cover their bigger spending plans most americans agree warren wants to slap a 2 tax on net worth in excess of 50 million and a 3 tax on fortunes in excess of 1 billion sanders would go further he suggests a tax of 1 on net worth over 32 million that would get progressively higher rising to 8 on wealth over 10 billion economists are not huge wealth tax fans they think it would spark tax evasion and for this reason not likely lead to much additional revenue more than that a wealth tax may be unconstitutional even if congress were to pass such a tax it would immediately be challenged in the courts the supreme court would likely hold it unconstitutional as was the case with the individual income tax which required the 16th amendment to the u s constitution be passed before it could be implemented carbon tax carbon taxes are taxes on polluting activities such as the use of gasoline or electricity economists across the political spectrum tend to support taxing carbon because it creates incentives for consumers and businesses to spend money in ways that reduce carbon emissions and slow climate change it would however increase the cost of driving flying and heating one s home it would also increase the price of all goods transported long distances and whose production requires a good deal of energy this regressive side to the tax is why sanders doesn t support carbon taxes though most of the other candidates do as an example yang s 40 per ton tax would cost the average american family 2 000 a year besides helping the environment the entrepreneur says a carbon tax would help finance his basic income guarantee ap photo mary altaffer turning the page with few exceptions the democrats running for president seem to be on the same basic tax policy page they all want to raise more revenue by taxing capital income at the same rate as labor income and increasing rates on the wealthy and on corporations they differ over the extra taxes like on carbon wealth and financial transactions whatever combination of these tax changes might be enacted if a democrat wins the white house in 2020 and congress is controlled by the democrats the rich will almost certainly lose their large gains under trump this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article
entrepreneurship is a spectrum so why did we forget to support its social side franck nouyrigat follow 12 min read feb 8 2020 1 listen share athe end of 2019 i had the chance to participate to unleash as a mentor unleash is an amazing program gathering hundreds of social entrepreneurs building social startups in a week to address the sustainable development goals at this event something became clear the tools used to support for profit or even mixed non for profit startups makes absolutely no sense when dealing with real impact for example one day health is building hospital in rural uganda they treated 20 000 people and are significantly reducing the cost needed to build hospital and train its staff once hospitals are launched they become self sustainable now who would invest in them venture capital won t social venture capital will argue it is not a sustainable model and foundation will find them too small at the end of the day it is always possible to find support but where is the needed bridges and clear paths that we so oftenly find when building for profit startups how come then do we see more and more impact venture funds in this post we will dive into the founders motivations and deduct the needs for new vehicle to effectively support social innovation and impact the sdgs that unleash is looking to tackle when working on startup weekend i rejected the idea of social entrepreneurs from my point of view any business has a social impact i could not see how someone building a coffee shop in tanzania and feeding people would have less of an impact than someone building an organic and eco friendly farm in california the only difference boils down to the founder s motivations one is greedy the other is virtuous steve blank proposed 4 types of entrepreneurs i would like to go further this archetype and explain why we can also think of entrepreneurship as a spectrum and how one founder can navigate through it during its carreer where would you fit on this spectrum what would be your entrepreneurship journey on this spectrum as often in entrepreneurship things are studied at the level of the company it s time to go down to the founder level defining social and capital entrepreneurs we should start by defining what we are talking when talking about social entrepreneurs this is a delicate exercise as entrepreneurship itself is poorly defined as academic amar bidhe put it entrepreneurs who start and build new businesses are more celebrated than studied as noam wasserman explains in his book founder s dillemas most economists assume that entrepreneurs are out to make a lot of money according to one researcher that the entrepreneur aims at maximizing his profits is one of the most fundamental assumptions of economic theory in the same book pr wasserman quotes a kauffman foundation study showing that 75 of founders of tech startups said that building wealth was a very important motivation so how can we explain social entrepreneurs in that context social entrepreneurs were introduced by the founder of ashoka himself inspired by gandhi and the ability of one individual to bring social change later on dr dr alex nicholls and others like pr yunus helped advance and theorized what a social entreprerise does but they rarely studied the founders if we want to study social entrepreneurs we are therefore left with the need to separate entrepreneurs in two groups those motivated by personal wealth formally known as entrepreneurs and those motivated by social impact and change we will call the first ones capitalist entrepreneurs and the second ones social entrepreneurs although i think it would be more exact to call them socialists entrepreneurs but the negative political connotation might explain why their advocates have chosen the word social instead a capitalist entrepreneur definition a capitalist entrepreneur is an agent of change looking to allocate resources toward a perceived economic opportunity to maximize personal wealth via equity a social entrepreneur definition a social entrepreneur is an agent of change looking to allocate resources toward a perceived social opportunity to maximize social impact we should of course notice that hell is paved of good intention and vice versa greed could have very positive side effect as described by adam scmith in both the wealth of the nation and its theory of moral sentiments wealth and external honours are their proper recompense and the recompense which they can seldom fail of acquiring what reward is most proper for promoting the practice of truth justice and humanity the confidence the esteem and love of those we live with humanity does not desire to be great but to be beloved it is not in being rich that truth and justice would rejoice but in being trusted and believed recompenses which those virtues must almost al ways acquire adam smith theory of moral sentiments the extreme archetypes of the entrepreneurial spectrum evil entrepreneurs and saint entrepreneurs evil entrepreneur an evil entrepreneur is a capitalist entrepreneur looking to maximize wealth at the cost of society to be fair i should have named it hostile entrepreneur instead of evil as the latin root of social is ally friendly but evil seemed more straightforward and naturally implies the existence of saint entrepreneurs this was way too much fun to resist an evil entrepreneur is nothing else than an entrepreneur who is getting rich without caring for anything or anyone else a good example would be any drug lord or dictators pablo escobar when capitalist entrepreneurs become evil saint entrepreneur an saint entrepreneur is a social entrepreneur looking to maximize social impact at the cost of its own wealth health ghandi when social entrepreneur become saints beyond good and evil do we need to moralize capitalism since god is dead as pr christensen noted in this video capitalism worked well in the usa because american entrepreneurs believed in a higher moral judge god and these moral values kind of self regulated the system as people are losing faith cf graph bellow it would therefore be natural to assume a rise of evil entrepreneurs as capitalist entrepreneurs can now go wild per se the entrepreneurial spectrum for many years i rejected the idea of evil entrepreneurs considering any entrepreneurial activity useful economically and therefore good for society my mistake had been to think of entrepreneurship as a binary or discrete system where the outcome would be steve blank 6 types of startups similar to the discovery of the visible light spectrum a rainbow where we started to see 7 colors instead of an infinite number here is a fun story about why newton advocated for that magic number i now see an infinite number of entrepreneurial types moving through the entrepreneurial spectrum the entrepreneurial spectrum is driven by a moral arbitrage between personal wealth and positive social impact the social entrepreneurs chose to maximize social impact while the capitalistic entrepreneurs follow the classical economic idea that one is motivated by personal gain with these 2 dimensions in place we can plot entrepreneurs on this entrepreneurial spectrum this spectrum shows something important society tends to celebrate the right side of the spectrum a lot more than its left side who knows the guy on the upper left we can therefore plot the trajectory of founders some might start high on social impact and end up low and vice versa an example bill gates from evil to saint entrepreneur bill gates entrepreneurial journey on the entrepreneur s spectrum i grew up hating bill gates as a young developer supporting open source and fighting microsoft seeing them as the enemy now i would not only like microsoft who now supports open source but also support bill gates with his amazing work thanks to its foundation this is a reminder that entrepreneurs can move on the entrepreneurial spectrum through time is capitalism more good than bad capitalism is the main reason poverty is dropping world wide back to an old economist debate since adam smith we know that capitalism can be good or bad it just somehow chose to be good it has certainly done an amazing job at reducing poverty worldwide but it also has done an amazing job at concentrating wealth to very few marxist theorists would say a revolution is on the horizon 26 people own as much as 3 8 billion people oxfam capitalism is also the main reason why only 26 people own as much as 3 8 billion people source oxfam capitalistic redemption the importance of philanthropy and the new gospel of wealth worth 1 5 trillion andrew carnagie wrote in the later 19th century in what would become his gospel of wealth that the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced for capitalism to still be a positive force we need to rebalance the force pund intended by increasing philantropic support to social entrepreneurs especially when the market is going up the other possible solution is the one advocated by piketty and bernie sanders or even some billionaires who are suggesting to increase governmental taxes to force redistribution but this assumes that government are good at building social innovation i disagree with this as i think social innovation will benefit from some kind of social competition from thousands of brains instead of a very top down approach but i also believe good policies could support social innovation my point of view is that we need to displace taxes towards social innovation instead of feeding slow and already very inefficient centralized governments according to ubs in its global philanthropy report the assets of philanthropic foundations in 23 countries is close to usd 1 5 trillion how could foundations do more when we are talking of 1 5 trillion of assets of philanthropic foundations it does not mean all that money went to support non profits and other projects actually most of it went on the stock exchange to support classic capitalism for example the gates foundation had 47 8b of total liabilities and net assets in 2018 versus 51 85b in 2017 around 7 of the fund went into grants the same year mr gates s wealth increased by 4b this explains why you can both have a foundation that is tax deductible and getting richer more evil every year many foundations are endowment funds meaning they are only required to follow the 5 rule in the usa it is also important to observe that foundations only represent a small fraction of the gdp on average kudos to the netherlands and switzerland though policymakers could test the idea of a dynamic rate instead of a static one of 5 this way when capitalism is working well foundations give back more this prevents the foundation to be a form of tax evasion tool to understand furthermore how the foundation works you can read about endowment funds here another point that i will develop in other blog posts is the introduction of new capital and impact risk vehicles as we explained at the beginning of this article the gap is too big between launching an innovative non profit and getting big enough to access foundation grants this is why i will introduce bridge capital non profit to foundation gap step capital to support step ups to go from few 100k to 20m ish and philanthropic angels to support social entrepreneurs from day 0 a lot to write so be sure to subscribe if you made it here we need the equivalent of a nobel prize for social entrepreneurs so now we know that both good and evil entrepreneurs exist we also know that entrepreneurs can move freely on the entrepreneurial spectrum based on their choices as our society perceives the richest people as the most successful we will also need to celebrate social entrepreneurs a lot more as a model to follow if we want to end up with a more balanced society for example when attempting to measure wikipedia s economic value it would be around 30b with trillions of indirect impact difficult to measure while its founders are only worth 1m jimmy wales and larry sanger frederick banting discovered the insulin nearly 100 years ago having watched countless people dying from type 1 diabetes before its discovery banting said insulin does not belong to me it belongs to the world and sold the insulin patent to the university for 1 today the insulin market is a 20 8b one and frederick descendant could have own a big chunk of that at even a higher valuation if he had taken a pure capitalistic approach who knows of him today finally even if it is hard to measure there is little doubt that the controversial website used by thousands of researchers has a huge academic and therefore economic impact too while its founder risked years of jail to launch it if thousands of people can give trillions of dollars of values to the world without expecting to capture wealth the least we can do is celebrating them to inspire the next generation and unleash amazing impact in conclusion lessons learned accepting social entrepreneurs implies to accept entrepreneurship as a spectrum with the existence of capital ists entrepreneurs and social ists entrepreneurs each having different motivations but at the end of the day with positive impact one short term the other long terms we need to celebrate entrepreneurs who built great impact we need to increase the number of philanthropic activities in a time when capitalism is functioning well and when the wealth gap keeps increasing we could suggest a dynamic ratio for endowment funds versus a static one of 5 in the usa this ratio could be re evaluated every year based on the market performance to redistribute more when capitalism is working well we need to introduce new financial vehicle to support social entrepreneurs these tools will be symetrical to what existis for capitalist entrepreneurs leading to a clear path more adapted for social impact such ideas are philantropic angels step capital venture debt introducing the concept of stepups in my next post etc we tend to celebrate those who made a lot of money for one main reason in a capitalist world money is the equivalent of food we need it to live therefore we seek it it fascinates most of us in this abstraction we built as mankind c f sapiens social entrepreneurs are perceived as having higher moral values but they offer a less attractive model that is made of sacrifices and austerity less food they can t give us well paid jobs or investment while those who have so much money have power and fascinates us with their success but at end of the day both types of succesful entrepreneurs only care about the impact they are building money is just a side effect of that passion what we perceive as good or evil is just an illusion due to our current economic model we need to compensate that entrepreneurial distortion by supporting and celebrating entrepreneurs who succeeded on the other side of the entrepreneurial spectrum bibliography special thanks for challenging questions feedbacks to wayne lifshitz mike ducker and tanner taddeo i would also like to thank professor clayton christensen who passed away during the redaction of this blog post professor christensen gladly met me and my co founder at hbs campus a couple of years ago when researching corporate innovation he greatly influenced me to study entrepreneurship through models instead of annectods this post is no exception the few great people i had the chance to meet all taught me to consider each individual as important as the next one professor christensen and his family was no exception may he rest in peace

in this monday jan 27 2020 photo a student at lake elementary school in san pablo calif walks through a hallway where bunches of electrical wires hang from the ceiling there s just one measure on california s march primary ballot a 15 billion school construction bond with a familiar but confusing name it s called proposition 13 but no it s not connected to the historic property tax measure from the 1970s often referred to as prop 13 the number 13 has simply cycled through leading to some bewilderment about what s on the ballot the howard jarvis taxpayers association has even asked the legislature to retire the number 13 to avoid confusion with the past measure but has been unsuccessful we ve had to answer a lot of phone calls on that very question said howard jarvis president jon coupal supporters of this new prop 13 as it s been called say it s needed to repair and modernize the state s k 12 schools community colleges and public universities meanwhile a prominent taxpayer s group has opposed the measure saying the state should use its multibillion dollar budget surplus and hold off on more borrowing state superintendent of public instruction tony thurmond who supports the bond said it would help make aging schools earthquake safe and remove mold asbestos and lead pipes it would also modernize school vocational centers he added noting 10 percent of california s schools are at least 70 years old most school districts struggle just to keep up with basic basic maintenance and repairs thurmond said they need help from our state to be able to handle some of these larger needs that will be able to keep our kids safe and help schools deal with lead and mold and seismic needs the proposed bond is the result of assembly bill 48 which the legislature passed last year and gov gavin newsom signed into law authorizing the measure to appear on the ballot it gained strong bipartisan support passing 78 to 1 in the assembly and 35 to 4 in the senate the yes on 13 campaign is led by a coalition of teachers unions and the state s building industry the main opposition comes from the howard jarvis taxpayers association whose mission includes preserving the historic proposition 13 approved in 1978 and its property tax protections for homeowners and businesses extremely costly debt service coupal with howard jarvis said he believes the goals of the new prop 13 bond are worthy but he said the state should use its 5 6 billion budget surplus for school repairs rather than going further into debt this is going to be an extremely costly debt service coupal noted it s 15 billion worth of school construction but it s going to nearly double in terms of cost when you add in the interest costs the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office estimates it will cost 26 billion over 35 years including 11 billion in interest that equates to a debt payment of 740 million each year coupal said the state s total debt payments have jumped from about 3 billion per year two decades ago to about 8 billion per year currently california voters have favored similar bonds for school facilities in recent years between 1998 and 2019 voters approved five such measures proposition 1a 1998 proposition 47 2002 proposition 55 2004 proposition 1d 2006 and proposition 51 2016 according to ballotpedia org incredible opportunity when asked if newsom considered using the state s surplus on school repairs a spokesperson pointed to his statements at a january budget press conference his comments did not directly address the question it s an incredible opportunity and it s also an equity based bond that focuses on high needs areas of our state newsom said in january david lang a sacramento state professor who studies the economics of education said it s not always the right call to rely on a surplus when paying for capital improvements it depends lang said is there a fear of a financial crash on the horizon are interest rates historically low you may want to ensure money is around for a rainy day thurmond the state schools superintendent agreed there are downsides to using existing state funds one thing that you have to consider when you are using surplus dollars is that from year to year the economy changes he said we have been putting money away in the rainy day fund because we know that at some point there will be an economic downturn one of the benefits of a bond funded program is it becomes a stable resource available for school districts to apply to implications for property taxes to seek that money coupal said local districts would need to provide matching funds through their own local bond proposals he said one of his biggest concerns about the measure is that it raises the maximum amount local school districts can borrow for elementary and high school districts for example the limit would be raised from 1 25 percent to 2 percent of assessed property value in this respect the new prop 13 intersects with and chips away at the old property tax measure of the same name it is inevitable that we will see a host of new local bond proposals all coming with property tax increases for homeowners coupal said the property tax implications are definitely there follow us for more stories like this

the us economy saw an explosion of new hiring in january possibly helped by mild weather but nonetheless getting the year off to an impressive start according to key government data released friday the surprising gain will be a boon to president donald trump who has emerged intact from his impeachment and trial and can now trumpet his economic record as he battles to win re election in november jobs jobs jobs the president tweeted following the report using the hashtag promisesmadepromiseskept so jobs continue to be great our country continues to do great trump told reporters later at the white house still after more than a decade of steady growth and job gains and with steep tariffs on many products from china still in place it is questionable whether the hiring pace can continue especially since the economy is projected to slow this year us employers added 225 000 new non farm jobs last month far surpassing expectations thanks to big gains in construction and leisure and hospitality but also health care and transportation the labor department reported the blockbuster number was a rebound from a tepid december report but the latest gains mean the economy added an average of 211 000 jobs in the last three months afp the us economy added far more jobs than expected in january but the unemployment rate increased slightly as more people entered the workforces afp that is a healthy improvement on the 175 000 average of 2019 when the economy cooled amid trump s multifront trade wars that led to tariffs on huge amounts of imports and american goods sold abroad even with the big job gains in january the unemployment rate ticked up by a tenth of a point to 3 6 percent but that can be attributed to an increase in the labor force as more people returned to the job market and the jobless rate still remains near a 50 year low amid virus induced fears of a sharp economic slump strong job creation and firming wage growth in january provided reassurance that the record long economic expansion still has room to run oxford economics analysts said however they said employers continue to face a volatile and uncertain global environment which along with a cooling domestic backdrop will lead them to be more cautious hiring mild weather boosts building the construction sector which is highly weather dependent added a stunning 44 000 positions last month nearly four times the monthly average of 2019 but the housing sector a key driver of the us economy continues to face a shortage of workers making it hard to keep up with demand for new homes with buyers

file bill pugliano america is currently short by around 5 to 6 million housing units and much more construction is needed said lawrence yun chief economist at the national association of realtors meanwhile jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped 21 000 bringing the total over the past six months alone to 288 000 according to the report the manufacturing sector which slumped into recession last year under the weight of punitive tariffs imposed in the trade confrontations both on inputs and on exports lost 12 000 positions in january almost entirely due to a decline in the auto sector trump has justified his confrontational trade policy with promises to help us manufacturing but industries have not seen the big boost manufacturing accounts for only 8 4 of payrolls but it punches above its weight in the eyes of the markets media and politicians said ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics and despite a trade truce signed with china last month which left most tariffs in place as well as the continental free trade deal with mexico and canada known as usmca industry leaders remain concerned what blue collar boom factory job growth simply hasn t been noticeable for a

market source the market ear the next two charts show the 10 year and two year gold price in aussie dollars not bad while financial markets go haywire all this is precisely how things are supposed to play out if you re a jim rickards strategic intelligence subscriber just when markets take a hit the gold price spikes and the aussie dollar adds gains oopsy but what exactly has changed one argument is all about the big gold buyers basic supply and demand in the gold market itself the actions of governments and central banks first a bit of context back in 1990 a bunch of european governments signed the central bank gold agreement it s better known as the washington agreement on gold even though the us government didn t sign up the idea of the agreement was for central banks to coordinate their gold sales to avoid price instability in the gold market it s a bit like opec but in a much smaller market gordon brown s decision to sell about half of the uk s gold in 17 auctions between 1999 and 2002 for an average price of us 275 per ounce took place under the agreement the 3 5 billion in sales would now be worth almost 19 billion oopsy the swiss and the imf were major sellers under the agreement as well it was renewed in 2004 2009 and 2014 but it is about to lapse and there s no interest in renewing it why because the big sellers have stopped selling gold as much or at all and their colleagues at governments and central banks around the world have turned into big buyers so the gold market s ability to absorb sales has improved central banks in emerging markets are buying in large quantities and taking physical delivery too the financial times has the data data released by the world gold council last week showed central banks led by poland china and russia bought 374 tonnes of gold the largest acquisition of the precious metal on record by public institutions in the first half of a year central banks accounted for nearly one sixth of total gold demand in the period the pattern advances on last year s activity in which central banks hoovered up more gold than at any time since the end of the gold standard where a country could link the value of its currency to the precious metal in 1971 the shift in attitude towards gold since the financial crisis was highlighted by a european central bank decision last week to cease an agreement to limit sales of gold as the region s institutions are no longer selling it in large volumes and are instead now net purchasers so there might be a radical change in the supply and demand for gold underway with a sustained seller turning into a major buyer melt up or meltdown another argument is anticipation of central bank stimulus lower interest rates and more qe are good for gold gold may not pay any interest but neither does much else these days in fact other safe havens cost you interest thanks to negative rates shae russell has previously pondered whether this ll happen in australia too qe means more money sloshing around the system and devaluing money suggests gold will go up in price in other words thanks to central bank action gold melts up when everything else melts down is that what s happening now perhaps markets certainly took a tumble last week then there s the de financialisation idea financial markets and institutions are so interconnected they re bound to get into trouble at the same time the wealthy who don t want to risk being in financial markets can no longer just keep their money in the banking system rules on bank bail ins apply in australia too under the plans bank deposits can be used to rescue a bank so simply selling your investments to wait out a crash doesn t work anymore gold will embarrass monetary policy makers you have to own something outside the financial system gold is an opt out opportunity that allows a clean break from financial assets not much else is liquid enough to offer the same sort of protection the big weakness in the argument for investing in gold remains you might ve noticed the common factor in the discussion above all the explanations for gold s rise hinge on governments and central banks gold is a politically sensitive asset giving it political risk not only that but the amount of financial gold being traded vastly outweighs the actual physical metal so prices are set by futures instead of gold supply and demand how much can gold go up before it becomes too much of an embarrassment for the monetary and political authorities before gold fever strikes in a way that hampers the war on cash before the authorities use the paper gold market to crush the price of physical gold it looks like we re going to find out the hard way the time to take physical possession of your gold is drawing near
andrew scheer said the liberals deficit spending has run the domestic economy aground compared to other six countries in the g7 group of advanced economies ottawa we look at our partners around the world and growth is higher in over half the g7 countries than it is here at home in canada conservative leader andrew scheer in the house of commons feb 3 andrew scheer and prime minister justin trudeau tangled in feb 3 s question period over the liberals economic management scheer said the liberals deficit spending has run the domestic economy aground compared to other six countries in the g7 group of advanced economies trudeau said all that spending is helping the economy grow advertisement mr speaker the facts are exactly the opposite scheer said mr speaker the conservatives consistently try to twist the truth trudeau retorted time for the baloney meter to count dollars and make sense this claim earns a rating of some baloney here s why the facts the most common measure of economic growth is percentage increases in gross domestic product which is a measure of the overall value of nation s economy scheer didn t put a timeline on his charge of economic woe but his office did in response to a question from the canadian press the conservatives pointed to quarterly gdp growth figures for the third quarter of 2019 that put canada behind the united states the u k and japan the 0 3 economic expansion recorded in that quarter was tied with france and ahead of the 0 1 for italy and germany some countries have reported their economic growth rates for the last three months of 2019 but canada hasn t yet that s expected at the end of february but last month the bank of canada said it expected to register a slowdown at the end of last year it estimated annual growth to be 1 6 in 2019 and 2020 and then two per cent in 2021 the international monetary fund tracks annual percentage increases in gdp based on those figures canada s growth in 2016 the first full year of the trudeau liberals government was 1 1 according to the imf which was the same figure recorded in italy and france and half a percentage point above japan which finished last in the g7 that year but since canada has either led g7 countries once in 2017 or been second in annual growth behind the united states the experts quarterly numbers generally are more volatile than annual figures and can be subject to temporary changes in demand energy prices exchange rates or situations in other countries among others says minjoon lee an assistant professor in carleton university s economics department the third quarter numbers scheer used as the foundation for his comment do put canada below three other nations in the g7 but one quarter earlier canada s growth was tops in the g7 the measure is very volatile as it only captures what happened in the last quarter this can be very sensitive to any external and temporary shocks that happened to the canadian economy lee says in an email comparing quarterly numbers among countries can introduce bias because key national industries can operate on different cycles says troy joseph an instructor in carleton s economics department for instance auto sales decline in the fall and winter in canada it isn t uncommon to look at gdp quarterly measure but to use that as an annual growth rate is a little misleading because we can see there is a big difference joseph says the verdict scheer s use of the oecd numbers are accurate on the surface but a digging deeper into the figures reveals that his comment was a tad simple for a more complex scenario for those reasons his statement has some baloney because important details are missing

the story behind the airbus deal the news came many months after a criminal investigation department cid probe into the procurement of airbus a 350 aircraft by srilankan airlines and its findings remained in limbo all of a sudden the attorney generalรข s department directed the police this week to obtain a warrant from the magistrateรข s court and arrest kapila chandrasena a onetime chief executive officer of srilankan airlines and his wife niyomali wijenayaka for alleged bribery the cid could not locate them and a government minister said they were not in the country the couple surrendered to their office on wednesday their statements were recorded and they were produced before chief magistrate ranga dissanayake and remanded till february 19 this unexpected development came after it transpired in a british court that the wife of srilankan airlines รข slaรข executive through a straw companyรข registered in brunei was offered up to us 16 84 million by airbus to รข influence slaรข s purchase of ten airbus aircraft and the lease of an additional four aircraft the court heard that the special frauds office sfo in london had discovered that only two million dollars of the us 16 84 million had so far been paid of the ten aircraft to be procured four were related to the purchase of the new a 350 900 and sparked the cid investigation the cidรข s findings had remained pigeonholed until matters surfaced in a british court at least one director of srilankan airlines knew five years ago that all was not well he raised issue but did not succeed here is an abridged account of how it played out srilankan airlines entered into a purchase agreement on june 28 2013 with airbus s a s in france for the manufacture and delivery of four a 350 900 aircraft the delivery dates were from the second quarter of 2020 with the last aircraft being delivered in the first quarter of 2021 the total cost of the four aircraft was us 222 356 600 85 that is over 2 2 billion us dollars or more than rs 28 2 billion according to then prevailing exchange rates financial information provided to the cabinet at that time 2012 2013 showed that srilankan recorded a revenue of only just us 948 million for ferrying 4 140 305 passengers its overall performance for 2015 2016 was us 1251 million for ferrying 4 789 902 passengers thus the order with airbus even exceeded srilankan operating costs srilankan paid pre delivery payments since november 2016 totalling us 19 214 638 45 this is besides a further us 7 5 million made as รข pre delivery payment รข however in that month november the board of directors of srilankan decided to stop any further payments by then the upfa government under whom the deals took place was out of office the yahapalana or รข good governance coalitionรข had come to power there were more payments made for different reasons as time went by it is during 2016 when the yahapalana coalition was taking stock of the previous regimeรข s financial commitments that details began to emerge kabir hashim minister of public enterprises and development under whom srilankan airlines was a subject told cabinet that there was an approximate cost of us 1 45 million per month per aircraft it was to be spread over a 12 year period he said in a memorandum dated april 19 2017 he said the รข total cost of this arrangement was to be us 835 2 million รข the leasing deal was with aercap an aircraft leasing company since 2014 this company had acquired international lease finance corporation ilfc the previous payments had in fact been made to aercap it is important to note that the purchase agreement with airbus deals only with the procurement of the รข airframeรข and รข propulsion system รข agreements have been entered into for other essential components of the aircraft with several other concerns including engines examples product agreement and total care service agreement with rolls royce plc zodiac seat france รข an agreement to purchase new seats thales avionics inc supply of flight entertainment lukedesign of france for cabin design three different agreements with airbus relating to a 350 900 aircraft payments for these had to be made separately cabinet memoranda srilankan board papers other documents and agreements seen by the sunday times lay bare a sordid tale of how the airbus deal had been handled there was no recourse to the cabinet of ministers or the agreement being subjected to scrutiny by the attorney general the argument brought out was that srilankan airlines was a corporate entity and not a part of the government yet it needed the taxpayersรข money to function and the treasury was dumping money into a veritable bottomless pit a re structuring plan รข to transform srilankan into a profitable public enterprise รข was decided by the cabinet of ministers on june 24 2015 two consultant firms nyras and skyworks consulted by the government had advised that operation of the a 350รข 900 aircraft would cost an additional us 30 million per year and they were not recommending them the government decided to cancel the contract but airbus declared according to kabir hashim minister of public enterprise development that รข cancellation is not an option neither can the order be changed completely to a narrow body four wide body would be given with perhaps an additional narrow body รข airbus also insisted that failure to pay the pre delivery payments would amount to a รข breach of the purchase agreement between srilankan and airbus in the event of a breach airbus will have an opportunity to make claims against sla รข the agreement was heavily loaded in airbusรข favour this is when the government decided to terminate the airbus deal the cid was first called to investigate airbus in the meanwhile refused to continue further discussions on the purchase agreement until the findings of the cid investigations were made known to it that led to a deadlock whilst the government was seeking various avenues to find out details the sunday times has seen the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors of srilankan held on october 27 2015 presided over by then chairman ajit dias this is what it says รข 7 3 airbus being investigated by european union on bribery charges รข mr joseph m s brito director informed the board that the eu european union was carrying out an investigation on airbus on bribery charges on aircrafts delivered to uk and switzerland he added that he would appreciate if a letter is written to airbus stating that the acquisitions of the aircrafts were not done in the best interest of the company and not carried out purely on commercial terms but also on various other monetary considerations and for airbus to confirm if there were any facilitators in securing the deal mr brito director pointed out that whilst the aircraft leases for a 350s were obtained at usd 1 4 million the market price was usd 1 2 million at the time the agreement was signed รข mr brito director tabled draft of the letters to be written to 1 airbus on the purchase of the aircrafts 2 rolls royce on the purchase of engines and 3 aercap on the lease of aircraft ceo present on invitation agreed to forward these letters to the relevant parties mr n de silva deva aditya director volunteered to forward the address of the president of the european commission to whom these letters were copied to the draft letters form part of these minutes รข there was no action taken on britoรข s request he raised issue at a meeting of the board of directors on november 24 2015 this is what the minutes of that meeting said รข mr brito reminded the board that a request was made by him to write letters to both airbus and rolls royce chairman stated that presently the company was in negotiation with both airbus and rolls royce regarding the engine for a 350s which the company had committed to take and the other was regarding the a 330 due in 2020 chairman informed that the chief officers namely the ceo cto and manique gunasekera ccao were of the view that by writing the said letters would sour the relationship with both rolls royce and airbus with whom the company had binding contracts mayuka ranasinghe hglaรข s views were also obtained in this connection รข ms gunasekera explained that because of the fact that presently negotiations are under way with rolls royce and airbus 2020 aircraft it was not advisable now to write the said letters this was agreed by the board รข chairman stated that the investigations have taken a serious turn at the fcid and cid on the re fleeting รข britoรข s draft letter incorporated in the board meeting minutes but not sent out is revealing it said รข dear sirs รข we refer to the purchase of eight a 350 900 due to be delivered to sri lankan airlines from october 2016 to 2020 รข two internationally renowned independent airline consultants have advised us that it is not in the best interest of the airline to act as the aircrafts sic as vital decisions appear to have been made not only on purely commercial grounds but also on various other monetary considerations we have also been advised that the prices paid for these aircraft have been well above the market prices at that time รข in connection with the above we wish to know whether you dealt transacted with any third party agent and or consultants who have facilitated your company to sell any of these aircraft to srilankan airlines if so could we please have the full details of their names and addresses and what fees commission remuneration were paid or repayable to them as a result of srilankan airlines committing to purchase any of these aircraft in case these facilitators agents have transacted in the name of a corporate or limited company the specific names of all individuals representing the corporate whom you dealt with for the sale of any of these aircraft purchases รข as we are not at all satisfied at the manner these purchases were carried out and as we have been informed that the european commission has commenced an international probe on allegedly corrupt deals on airbusรข aircraft sales we are copying this to the president of the european commission to follow up on this matter รข we thank you for your assistance and look forward to your co operation รข yours faithfully รข chairmanรข minister kabir hashim said in a memorandum to the cabinet on april 19 2017 that the termination agreement in line with the terms agreed by the ministry of finance was as follows termination fee for airbus a 350รข 900 aircraft us 154 00 m reduced termination fee for three airbus a 350 900 us 98 00 m forfeit security deposit already paid us 7 5 m cash payment from srilankan airlinesรข us 90 5 m the arrangement was subject to srilankan airlines taking over the leases of two narrow bodied aircraft owned by aercap and leased to mihin lanka according to an extract of the minutes of the cabinet committee on economic development which gave approval dated september 9 2016 รข after a detailed discussion srilankan airlines was authorised to negotiate a termination cost for the three aircraft within the range of usd 75 85 million in order to close the issue รข however a copy of the agreement between srilankan airlines with international finance lease corporation titled รข termination and amendment agreementรข dated october 4 2016 seen by the sunday times tells a different story that agreement says รข รข lessee hereby agrees to pay lessor an amount of us 146 500 payable in eight months รข signing on behalf of srilankn airlines was suren ratwatte then chief executive officer sean sullivan ceo of international lease finance corporation signed for his company how much exactly was paid as termination fee therefore remains a mystery like so many other issues that have clouded the airbus deal all the money spent on the four airbus a 350 900 vanished into thin air and neither sri lanka nor srilankan airlines received any benefit it is deeply in contrast with a hospital watcher who is arrested for taking five rupees as a bribe to allow a visitor to see a patient outside visiting hours he is first remanded for two weeks the paradise service from srilankan had been enjoyed only by a handful the question is whether all of them will be known

many more people were encouraged to look for work showing that the economy remains robust despite threats from china s viral outbreak an ongoing trade war and struggles at boeing the strong job growth gives president donald trump more evidence for his assertion that the economy is flourishing under his watch it may also complicate the argument his democratic presidential rivals are making that the economy isn t benefiting everyday americans the labor department said friday that employers added a robust 225 000 jobs in january at the same time a half million americans feeling better about their job prospects streamed into the job market most found jobs but those that didn t were newly counted as unemployed and their numbers raised the jobless rate to 3 6 from december s half century low of 3 5 seven democratic presidential candidates were to debate later friday in new hampshire leading contenders notably sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have built campaigns around the argument that the middle class has been mostly left out of an economic expansion that has disproportionately served the wealthy the outcome of the presidential race could hinge in part on whether enough voters agree that inequality and rising costs for services such as health care housing and college education outweigh the benefits from nearly 11 years of economic growth democratic primary voters are very open to messages about the economy doing badly said jason furman a top economic adviser to former president barack obama said furman added though i don t know that that would be consistent for the electorate as a whole as the election intensifies views of the economy remain broadly polarized according to a pew research center survey released friday 81 of republicans and republican leaning

what happens when sudan is removed from the u s terror list delisting is just one of many steps needed to improve the economy and advance sudan s democratic transition hilary mossberg and john prendergast its been nearly a year since sudan s longtime dictator omar al bashir was ousted from power as the country moves to transition to democracy its civilian government and sudanese civil society have called on the u s government to remove khartoum from the state sponsors of terrorism sst list the sentry s hilary mossberg and john prendergast recently argued that although delisting is an important for sudan s transition it is just one of multiple steps needed from both the u s and sudan in order for pro democracy forces to achieve their goals mossberg and prendergast explain what the actual impact of delisting would be and what sudan s government can do to get there does the state sponsor of terrorism designation prevent international banking and private investment in sudan simply put no the sst designation does not directly prevent international banking or private investment in sudan there is a common misconception that sanctions imposed by the united states are inhibiting economic growth in sudan in fact almost all of the sanctions imposed on sudan were removed in 2017 all that remain are u n mandated sanctions related to darfur which haven t been updated in years and only prohibit arms transfers into darfur as well as financial transactions and international travel of a small number of people although the sst listing may lead to some initial pause on the part of banks with respect to doing business in sudan it does not prevent them from undertaking any such efforts for example oracle recently announced that it would be working with a sudanese bank on a mobile banking project what does cause most banks and companies to hold back private investment is the opacity of sudan s entire economic system this opacity makes it difficult for banks and companies to conduct customer due diligence on sudanese clients and to fully understand possible risks in an effort to increase foreign investment and lure international banks and companies back to sudan the government and banking sectors should demonstrate greater transparency enforce and comply with sudan s existing anti money laundering laws and policies and improve banking supervision policies and practices these steps will allow international banks and private investors to adequately assess risks and possibly increase investment in sudan what would be the actual impact if sudan were delisted and would sudan then be eligible for debt relief and financing from the world bank and the imf when sudan is delisted one immediate impact will be the ability of the u s government to vote in favor of imf and world bank debt relief packages and other multilateral loans and financing it s important to note however that the sst designation does not prohibit any other country or group of countries from providing debt relief or aid to sudan additionally when the terrorism designation is lifted and imf and world bank loans can move forward imf and world bank policies on arrears may still prevent lending to sudan in mid december 2019 an imf team visited sudan to discuss the 2019 article iv consultation with the government of sudan the team issued a statement at the conclusion of the visit indicating that while sudan is eligible for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative both the terrorism designation and the large external debt and arrears impede access to external financing and development the imf team encouraged sudan s government to obtain comprehensive debt relief and to increase cooperation with the imf s policies and payments in addition to possible debt relief delisting will likely improve the perception of sudan as a place for investment particularly for american companies however even with the delisting sudan needs to focus on reforming the banking sector and rooting out corrupt actors entrenched in the system until those reforms take place real risks remain and the uncertain investment climate will continue what has the transitional government done and what still needs to be done to signal to the united states that sudan is prepared to be taken off the state sponsors of terrorism list sudan has taken several important steps to signal to the united states that they are prepared to be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism list sudan has increased counterterrorism cooperation with the u s government for several years and terrorist activity including fundraising within sudan has decreased substantially the crucial next step is the negotiated settlement with the families of victims of terrorist attacks conducted with alleged material support from the former sudanese government those attacks include the 1998 bombings of the u s embassies in kenya and tanzania and the 2000 attack on the uss cole sudan has made some effort to reach a settlement there is a u s supreme court hearing scheduled for late february 2020 related to the case specifically the question of whether the uss cole victims can collect punitive damages the linkage of the settlement to the sst delisting is a policy decision not a statutory provision of the sst designation the government has also taken important steps to improve their anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regime although there is still more to be done a strong anti money laundering regime will make it much more difficult to finance terrorism using sudan s banks it will also show the u s and the rest of the international community that the new government is prioritizing counterterrorism and wants to protect its financial sector from potential abuse beyond delisting what are other necessary reforms that sudan must undergo to improve the climate for private investment and would the u s consider other means of economic sanctions sudan must prioritize reforming the banking sector to encourage private investment banking supervision remains weak and the central bank s capacity to crack down on corrupt banks is largely untested the central bank governor is aware of the weaknesses though and has committed to redoubling anti money laundering efforts in order to improve the integrity of sudan s banking system sudan has laws in place to combat illicit finance but the implementation of these laws is uneven at best and generally ineffectual all parts of the system need to work together to improve effectiveness the central bank should encourage sudan s banking sector to file suspicious activity reports particularly related to corruption and terrorism finance and those reports should be used by sudan s financial intelligence unit to open investigations and bring cases to the judiciary for prosecution on sanctions it is our view that the united states the african union the european union and other concerned governments should consider imposing targeted network sanctions on the spoilers of democratic and economic reforms elements remain within the government of sudan that seek to maintain corruption for their own personal gain and those elements likely have the ability to use private banks to launder proceeds of corruption networks that continue to facilitate state capture should be sanctioned in order to help the new government cut them out of the system and improve sudan s investment climate our organization the sentry will release its first investigative report related to sudan in february and continues to provide information to governments and banks to assist in their efforts to take action the united states could also consider implementing a form of responsible investment reporting requirements that would ensure that banks and others in the private sector who are beginning new business in sudan are required to conduct and publish the results of key elements of due diligence such a system could help ensure broader transparency overall from both the public and private sectors this article represents the views of the authors and not those of usip the

the spread of the coronavirus in china has continued to alarm markets abroad although north american equity markets have largely bounced back after earlier jitters pushed investors to the side lines in part that s because aside from the go forward risks of global supply chain disruptions from the illness and the obvious human cost the current economic backdrop abroad continues to look a little better the uk s official exit from the european union last week seems to have at least reduced near term economic uncertainty in europe with early signs of business sentiment stabilizing in the uk and the euro area the us industrial sector has also looked a little better with the us china phase 1 deal at the least trimming the odds of another significant deterioration in the trading relationship between the two world powers until at least beyond the 2020 us elections january industrial production numbers in the week ahead still could look soft with earlier announced aircraft production shutdowns kicking in but the ism manufacturing index unexpectedly jumped out of contractionary territory for the first time in 6 months in january us fed chair powell is likely to reiterate the broadly positive tone from the last fed policy announcement in his semi annual testimony to congress next week from the bank of canada s perspective there is still uncertainty about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth but at this point we think that spill overs to the canadian economy will be relatively modest the central bank will nonetheless be concerned about slower underlying growth in the economy late in 2019 our forecast that the economy will continue to grow slowly in the first half of this year supports our view that the central bank will cut the overnight rate by 25 basis points in april still the canadian job market looks solid with the unemployment rate ticking lower to start 2020 and wage growth still running strong the contradicting signals being sent by soft gdp growth and solid labour market numbers brings back memories of a year ago when economic growth was also slowing worryingly over the winter despite ostensibly strong employment growth it s still too soon to say which trend will dominate this year but stronger labour markets and what looks like a less worrying external growth backdrop argue that underlying economic growth trends are probably not as bad as the latest gdp tracking numbers imply our forecast is for just a 0 3 increase in real gdp in q4 2019 the week ahead will unfortunately provide little added clarity on those underlying growth trends in canada with january housing starts and home resales the only significant economic reports on tap those are certainly important in their own right but housing markets have also not been a source of growth concerns indeed quite the opposite the bank of canada has been more concerned that low interest rates are spurring a rapid increase in housing demand along with another acceleration in debt growth in the already highly leveraged household sector early reports from local real estate markets suggest that housing markets continued to broadly tighten in early 2020
there is something exciting about adesuwa okunbo rhodes that the world needs to see and learn from despite being just 30 years old she has been named an agent of impact changing the narrative within finance and impact investing for women and making an impact on society one investment at a time kingsley jeremiah met with the chief executive officer of aruwa capital management and she told him how it all started and how she got here with her passion for women to succeed in business enjoy kindly tell us about yourself i was born in nigeria and started primary school in chrisland and did one year of secondary school in atlantic hall lagos but i was sent to a boarding school st lawrence college ramsgate in england at age 11 for me it was a good foundation to be away from home at a young age and a step towards being independent afterwards i proceeded to bristol university united kingdom where i studied economics i have always known that i wanted to be in the world of finance and i found economics interesting and it gave me a good foundation for the investment banking world that followed university my interest has been in the financial markets from a young age particularly its impact on daily life during my first year in university i got an investment banking job at lehman brothers which was very rare at the time and it was a unique privilege to be selected in my first year when i just turned 18 i did my second internship at j p morgan also in investment banking and following that was offered a full time position at j p morgan after graduation at j p morgan i worked in the acquisition and leveraged finance teams covering a range of sectors and countries i executed 3 6 billion of structured credit transactions across emerging markets including nigeria during my time in investment banking mergers and acquisitions department of the company i executed 2 0 billion of m a transactions in the united kingdom and united states i believe the long hours and deadlines laid the foundations for being the entrepreneur i am today before j p morgan i worked with tlg capital as an investment analyst i was involved in a number of private equity transactions in anglophone africa including a very successful principal investment i made in uganda the investment in uganda was a company that manufactured generic pharmaceutical products such as anti malaria and anti retroviral drugs i took the decision to personally invest because of the impact it would have on people s lives in africa we have a lot of fake medicine but our efforts reduced that challenge significantly in the country as the company was the first who pre qualified factory at the time the business helped uganda become self sufficient in manufacturing those drugs and was also a very strong financial return for all shareholders the balance between impact and profit really sparked by interest in impact investing i became a co founding partner at syntaxis capital africa in 2014 where i spent five years as the managing partner the company was a provider of growth capital to smes in nigeria and sub saharan africa syntaxis capital africa was part of syntaxis capital limited a private equity fund operating in other emerging markets with 300 million in assets under management from global institutional investors there i led and worked on transactions worth more than 200 million across sub saharan africa at what point did you decide to establish your company in 2019 i took a decision to start my own firm aruwa capital management which is a continuation of syntaxis capital africa i decided that for the long term of the business we had to take ownership and control our own destiny most of the businesses we take on are currently undervalued and underserved by larger financial institutions based in lagos aruwa capital focuses on providing growth capital to untapped indigenous businesses with an operating history and track record of profitability of at least three years the company focuses on high growth sectors such as fmcg manufacturing tech enabled non banking financial services education healthcare and b2b services why do you support women more in your firm africa has the highest percentage of female entrepreneurs in the world one of the reasons i wanted to set up an investment firm was to have more successful women in business and empower women at all levels of society institutional investors should not think twice before funding women but unfortunately we do not yet have enough success stories to change that status quo the fact that only 2 per cent of women entrepreneurs in africa have access to capital is worrisome if women are funded and empowered we can take strategic roles in our industries and the success stories will help other women to have easy access to capital also there is a huge multiplier effect when a woman is empowered 90 per cent of a woman s wealth is invested back into her family and community because the woman controls the household when women have access to capital and financial dependency they impact the economy and society because of the significant roles they play especially in africa our latest investment manufactures hygiene products like baby diapers sanitary pads net maternity pads among others eighty per cent of their products are bought and used by women there are still many parts of nigeria where women are not using the right products during birth or their menstrual circle whilst this business drives industrialisation in nigeria our investment also helps to increase capacity whilst improving health outcomes and creating further employment opportunities for women for businesses we work with we emphasise on the importance of gender balance in their operations we strongly believe that when we have a gender balanced team we will have stronger returns profitability and there will be multiplier effect on society what can be done to address the challenges facing smes in nigeria the challenges cannot go in a day but access to capital remains a critical challenge many commercial banks in the country are not ready to provide the capital that meets the specific needs of smes when they do the interest rate is high and tenors are too short the capital has to be tailored to peoples needs and their cash flow and has to be patient we also need the right capacity building to be able to institutionalise businesses to become sustainable considering that a lot of the businesses are family owned there is need for the right operational support to ensure the right processes and systems are in place these will make the business effective while there are the necessary checks and balances the economic outlook of the country has been worrisome to some experts especially looking at the current debt profile tax and budget deficit what is your take on this we need to diversify our economy and i think the current administration is doing it in the agricultural sector we need to support businesses that are driving industrialisation e g local manufacturing probably with tax holidays the development on border closure is a good move as it has encouraged local manufacturing we also need to reform the pensions industry nigeria has more than 25billion in pension assets and i don t think we re utilizing them for investment to match the long term nature of the assets we need to match those assets with longer term investment private equity and infrastructure specifically right now those assets are idle in short term investments and it is high time we addressed the mismatch in my view government must work with the private sector to encourage the economy private equity is a big part of providing patient capital to businesses that will have a significant effect on the economy in terms of employment opportunities we should diversify the economy from oil and provide incentives to back local manufacturers and industrialisation we can raise capital from pension fund to back industries and invest in infrastructure what were the challenges finding your path in life i come from a good family but i have always been interested in making an impact and a name for myself through hard work and being focused i was not a spoilt child who relied on her parents i have always made sure that i did everything by myself because i wanted to make a name for myself and chart my own path the only thing your parents owe you is a quality education but it is left to you to make good use of it i am a believer in writing your own story and success but as a young woman it was challenging raising funds and convincing investors that i was committed and could do a good job just as a man at 30 everything is going well for you what has been your secret to success i am highly focused and i grew up fast in school and university i was a year ahead of myself in my career i am always surrounded by older people being focused and persistent has been a driver of any success i may have had how do you ensure career doesn t affect your role as a wife and mother i am married and have a son there is a saying that you cannot have it all and that is the truth for me it is all about prioritising things i also think the man you get married to as a career woman matters a lot my family and husband have been very supportive of my dreams most importantly one has to look up to god for strength and wisdom because it is not easy to be a good mother a good wife and a good ceo it is challenging but with a supportive family god and determination everything is possible how do you take time off your busy schedule i enjoy travelling cooking and playing tennis to relax who are your role models i look up to a lot of strong women in finance and industry i admire daisy danjuma and i look up to her as a role model i also look up to bola adesola ibukun awosika osaretin demuren adeola azeez and a host of other amazing women apart from being at the pinnacle of finance and industry these amazing women walk the talk and pave ways for other women to rise when women support other women the sky is the limit what advice do you have for women women should remain focused and determined they need to know what they want to achieve and have a dogged determination to achieve it no matter what one of my favourite quotes is that a river does not cut through rock because of its power it cuts through because of its persistence once i set my mind on something and i am certain it is god s will for my life i will do everything to ensure that i meet the objective and fulfil that purpose that s how i have made my achievements under 30 i had a successful career in investment banking private equity and now i have been able to start my own investment fund to impact the economy and improve the lives of people by investing in small and medium size businesses we have been able to generate attractive returns for investors with added socio economic development benefits apart from making strong financial return we have been able to make an impact on the economy by generating jobs for the youth and women as well as generating tax for the government the passion is to be able to build my own firm while also making long lasting impact on the lives of people and the financial ecosystem in nigeria and across africa that is actually the legacy i want to be remembered for

transcribed and translated by eliana loveluck it has been edited and condensed for length and clarity the october 25 expression of people power was largely peaceful but since the protest movement exploded on october 18 triggered by an increase in subway fares and led by chilean students vandalism looting rioting and the burning of metro stations and other buildings and businesses have become an almost daily occurrence in chilean cities along with many other forms of opposition to the status quo the security forces have responded with great violence in the first month of protests 22 people were killed and more than 2 000 injured many by police brutality over 200 chileans have been blinded by rubber bullets fired by police at point blank range and more than 6 000 have been arrested as the protests continue the united nations commission on human rights the organization of american states and amnesty international are all investigating evidence of human rights abuses committed by the government of conservative president sebastiรกn piรฑera the chilean congress is now weighing a motion to remove him from office during a visit to santiago on november 22 nation contributor peter kornbluh sat down with award winning chilean journalist mรณnica gonzรกlez mujica to obtain her unique perspective on these dramatic events gonzรกlez has had a long prolific career as a writer editor and investigative reporter in chile exposing the human rights crimes of the pinochet regime and documenting political and economic corruption in the post pinochet era in 2002 she founded and directed a weekly magazine siete 7 in 2005 she founded and became executive editor of the daily newspaper diario siete in 2007 she cofounded with us journalist john dinges the center for investigative journalism ciper where she was executive editor until earlier this year gonzรกlez just received chile s highest media honor the national journalism award in recognition of her 40 year career that according to the award committee has honored the profession and supported the return of freedom of expression and democracy in chile peter kornbluh more on chile and the united states 40 years ago

connection between the quality of their lives and the systematic corruption of chilean businesses and the multinational corporations and the systematic fraud in congress that involves all politicians which is why there are no political party flags waving in the demonstrations the eyes of the chilean people have opened they are acting accordingly some are protesting others are involved in permanent town hall meetings this last week i have been invited to attend 25 cabildos in concepciรณn antofagasta and valparaรญso and others in santiago the people are mobilized they have found each other again and they don t want to go back to their homes alone that is beautiful chileans have found their identity with people they didn t even know some families of course have had conflicts and have broken apart but this fracture is much less ideological than in 1973 now it is the people against the elite current issue view our current issue pk how do you think president sebastiรกn piรฑera has handled this crisis mg piรฑera is completely paralyzed overwhelmed and outnumbered he does not have the capacity to deal with this but i don t know if there is anyone who would have that capacity let s be clear this popular rebellion whose dimensions we still do not understand caught us all by surprise this caught us completely unprepared some more than others pk so the fact that all hell broke loose in chile in mid october was completely unexpected mg yes and no first i ll tell you why it wasn t a surprise i have been working intensely over the past 12 years since we founded ciper on corruption i knew that it was a problem but i had not realized how systematic the problem was and how profoundly chile s institutions were corrupted across the board the corruption of the system is the mother of what is happening to us now the relationship between politics and private money has corrupted the republic and our democracy and finally the very soul of this country people believe in nothing and they believe in no one that s where we are pk and the depth of anger among chilean citizens did that surprise you mg the level of discontent does not surprise me since 2011 there have been a series of huge multimillion dollar financial scandals involving the major economic actors in this country these scandals have resulted in no jail time for anyone so you have this series of scandals that shook people and the impunity provoked great indignation the cumulative effect of that indignation resulted in this current social explosion what i didn t realize was that people had reached such a level of clarity about the putrefaction of chile s economic system i underestimated the indignation and frustration of the people of chile santiago in some areas looks as if it has been bombed and getting from one sector of the city to another is incredibly difficult there is a tremendous level of violence rioting looting which provokes great fear but that fear is much less than the anger and the rage that people feel much less than the desire to say enough pk share with us some of the specific grievances of the chilean public that have fueled the protest movement mg i ll give you a list the list has to do with the system which is not a free market system but a system of accumulation and monopolies where multinational economic groups play a huge role for example one focus of discontent is the system of retirement pensions chile doesn t have a social security system like the majority of europe we had a social security system before the coup but the dictatorship eliminated it and in subsequent decades of democracy we have not been able to recover that social security system the majority of the accumulation of capital is held by seven private afps the creation of the military dictatorship which tout as one of its greatest economic successes that s a total lie this privatized retirement system is one of obligatory savings it is not voluntary it was created in the 1980s and was implemented by force the system currently has over 10 million participants all workers must participate it was sold to the chilean public on the claim that people would retire with 75 percent of their most recent salaries a lie in fact the pensions that people receive are truly miserable an average pension for a man is 492 per month for women on average 295 per month it s lunacy education is another problem in 2011 there was a huge uprising to protest the poor quality of education and the profits being made off of university students eight years have passed and there is still no legislation addressing those issues at ciper we exposed how each university was taking money from profiteers how their educational systems were substandard how the universities purchased their accreditation and how students were becoming deeply indebted to pay for tuition in order to obtain a degree that is worth absolutely nothing but the prosecutors who undertook that investigation were not able to punish anyone because in the end it is legal fraud a third widespread grievance is the crime of collusion price fixing there has been price fixing in the supermarkets on the cost of chicken and collusion in fixing inter urban bus fares there was the major scandal of the matte group which controls paper production in brazil and in chile where they colluded with a swedish company for years to artificially raise the price of diapers and toilet paper in the middle of the matte group scandal in 2016 the chilean congress passed a law to increase the punishment for those who engaged in price fixing but of course no one from the matte group was sent to prison indeed since that law was passed not a single criminal case has been brought forth to the national economic prosecutor zero not one but the most egregious criminal price fixing cases involve the pharmaceutical industry three multinational companies dominate the chilean market and they have colluded to keep the prices of medicine extremely high this scandal provoked a high level of public indignation just in the past 48 hours the fiscalรญa nacional econรณmica released a new report stating that the cartel of pharmaceutical corporations that control the chilean market allocates 200 million per year to bribe doctors to prescribe their products because of the lack of penalties and regulations you have medications that go from 100 percent more than their value up to 400 percent more only now in the middle of this uprising has the chilean congress focused on approving a law enabling the government to regulate the prices of medications pk one concrete result of the demonstrations has been an agreement between the government and the political parties to replace chile s pinochet era constitution which safeguards the privatization of the economy and impedes socioeconomic change the accord calls for a referendum in april for the chilean people to vote on how to proceed in drafting a new constitution how do you see this process and the success of accomplishing it mg i see it as very dangerous and uncertain and also as hopeful everything related to the chastity belt they the military regime put around this democracy is spelled out in the constitution for example the afps are tied to the constitution all labor union activities were destroyed during the dictatorship and the constitution prohibits them from reorganizing collective bargaining is prohibited for the first time the chilean people are making that connection but they also see the long process of arriving at a new constitution as distant from their needs and demands they want action now they want to see the electric bills go down they want to see water bills go down they want to see pensions increased but i also see the rich as very fearful i see the economic groups as very fearful and so i imagine there is forceful pressure on the government to restore order in the streets pk let s talk about the government s attempts to restore order in the face of daily rioting and looting the shadow of pinochet s human rights atrocities hangs over piรฑera s efforts to confront the social upheaval at the same time the chilean police known as the carabineros have engaged in egregious human rights violations including shooting young protesters in the face with rubber bullets deliberately blinding or partially blinding hundreds of them these abuses have become a worldwide symbol of chile s new repression mg it is a very powerful symbol of the repression but of course it is much more than a symbol when you see young people who have lost an eye in some cases both eyes it s a brutal thing so we are talking about 60 000 carabineros stationed throughout chile and they are very dangerous because they feel free to kill what is clear is that the police knew that they weren t supposed to shoot the pellets at a range of less than 20 meters but they have violated that policy over and over again not only do we have 220 people who have lost an eye we also have over 1 000 people who have been severely injured and hospitalized as a result of the pellets on top of that there are an additional 400 people injured by bullets if you add all this together this is huge catastrophe these abuses must be punished pk what will the impact of this protest movement be on chile is this a turning point in chilean history mg chile will not for better or for worse be the same as it was before we are used to earthquakes and they usually last a maximum of five minutes we say ok it s over and we begin to rebuild this situation however is like a hurricane chile will never be the same because this hurricane is not ending anytime soon and i don t know where it will take us i believe that this explosion of protests which reminds us of the dictatorship because of the violence involved has shown us a face of chile that we didn t recognize i never witnessed anything like this during the popular unity government or even under president eduardo frei in the 1960s as we are speaking today the hurricane has become harsher it has developed more powerful winds we are in a very delicate period because the social violence has become even harsher and much of it is orchestrated by organized crime in order to rob gun factories the looters used weapons typically used by organized crime they set off fireworks in plaza italia and these are typically used by narco traffickers to announce that a shipment is arriving or leaving the narcos are one of the main winners of this month s protests because not every burned out and looted supermarket pharmacy and bank will be rebuilt in those peripheral poblaciones where poor people reside that vacuum will be filled by the narcos i am sure that they are there and they are present in all those lootings it s become a territorial and very unequal struggle because we are fighting for more democracy not for destruction so we don t know where this will lead us this is the first time we are confronting a power that is different from what we have confronted in the past today there is an elite that represents the real power of the multinationals which are complicit with those who hold local economic power piรฑera is one of 11 billionaires in chile essentially we have multinational corporations and the 1 percent of the richest against the majority of the people i have watched the rich put on their war paint because they are terrified they re not buying anything they re taking their dollars out of the country because they also do not know where this will end we are in uncharted territory where everyone is trying to measure their strength but no one knows what they will ultimately confront pk historically chile has been a pioneering nation are chileans capable of creating a new model for change that addresses the problem plaguing so many nations economic inequality what is your hope for a model that chile could create for the rest of the world mg you know yesterday i heard the song of the chilean music group prisioneros called el baile de los que sobran the dance of the leftover people being sung during protests in another latin american nation colombia i shuddered it reminded me that after the coup i started hearing el pueblo unido jamรกs serรก vencido being sung in so many other countries and that i don t want but i like el baile de los que sobran because of that phrase no one really wanted to help us in truth that s how it is now these young people sing these lyrics no one really wanted to help us join the dance of the leftover people take my hand look at me touch me we are together we will see if we are capable of constructing and engaging in dialogue of finding each other and to have the patience to engage in dialogue to achieve a new constitution and to strongly press for a new social agenda so that people do see actual change i see three scenarios 1 the rich will say ok it s over the narcos and thugs are in control of the streets this is no longer feasible we will declare a state of emergency and bring the military back into the streets in order to ensure order for as long as necessary so i see the possibility of a military coup but one where nobody could say yes there was a military coup that is the worst case scenario 2 things calm down with continued isolated incidents young people become tired and older people have to go back to work because people have to eat everything gets postponed until march when we have a new explosion because of capital flight and the dire poverty that results from the collapse of the economy amid this ongoing upheaval that is a very possible scenario 3 we start to rebuild despite the fact that we will continue to see isolated incidents because young people have lost their fear we start to advance in preparations to vote in april to change the constitution with a constituent assembly an independent elected body voted for with 100 percent of the citizenry participating and progress in setting a new social agenda in other words a democracy with all its ups and downs but constructing a true democracy in chile today you find many young people participating in the protests who say i am doing this for me and my parents or for me and my grandparents because they don t make enough to eat or to cover their medication and that is the truth i have never heard of anything like this in my entire life even when i was a young girl the daughter of a worker we have actually seen cases of grandparents committing suicide they don t make enough to survive and that is why i have a seen a rebirth of a word that my father who was an important labor leader in railroads used that is the word dignity that is a word we lost in 1973 when the military coup took place and we have not been able to recuperate that term again but now dignity reemerges in its glory and majesty in other words we will continue to struggle until that word becomes the norm and the reality
finance minister mthuli ncube seems to like quoting economic principles found in textbooks editorial comment finance minister mthuli ncube seems to like quoting economic principles found in textbooks but for some reason the treasury boss forgets the most basic economic principle economic growth is driven by consumer spending no consumer spending means no economic growth according to american financial literacy website investopedia consumer spending is the total money spent on final goods and services by individuals and households for personal use and enjoyment in an economy many economists especially those in the tradition of john maynard keynes a renowned 20th century economist whose ideas shaped economics believe consumer spending is the most important short run determinant of economic performance and is a primary component of aggregate demand as such consumer spending is the largest component of gross domestic product in any economy and the target of keynesian fiscal and monetary policies in macroeconomics keynesian economics is an economic theory premised on total spending in the economy and its effect on output and inflation the reason we digress is to show that consumer spending essentially drives economic growth however in zimbabwe consumer spending is falling and is falling fast ncube seems to have forgotten the five components of consumer spending namely disposable income income per capita income inequality household debt and consumer expectations and where zimbabwe is involved these five components are all down disposable income is shrinking because of a devaluing zwl that is eroding wages income per capita is being determined by hyperinflation against shrinking salaries and income inequality is growing as the gap between the rich and poor is widening the learned professor should also note that household debt is rising as families or individuals are getting into more debt to meet rising costs lastly consumer expectations are down because simply put there is no confidence in this government despite stopping the publication of annual inflation reports the truth is the devaluing zwl has forced businesses to change their prices almost on a daily basis to protect the value of their goods or services as a result most consumers are unable to afford a lot of goods in the hyperinflationary environment with individuals and families living way below the poverty datum line the devaluing zwl is also eroding the wages to a point where a person s salary has lost a significant amount of its value by month end from the start of the month so zero consumer spending means zero growth and the sooner ncube realises this the sooner the economy can grow or maybe just maybe the time has now come for ncube to resign and retire to his theories
americans are one of the most overworked populations in the world with the average worker clocking 47 hours a week americans work more hours per year than almost any other industrialized country 423 more than german workers 248 more than workers in the united kingdom and 266 more hours a year than french workers according to the latest organisation for economic co operation and development statistics the united states is also the only industrialized country without national parental leave benefits or legally mandated paid vacation most european countries require at least 20 days of paid holiday and vacation time the french actually get an entire month of annual vacation can you imagine as with a wide variety of different workers rights the united states lies well behind the rest of the industrialized world but it wasn t always this way in fact workers in the united states were once on the front lines of the struggle for a shortened workweek back in the early days of industrial capitalism it was not uncommon for workers to work anywhere between 10 16 hours a day but a bloody centuries long battle fought by socialists unionists and other similar groups in the united states won us the 40 hour workweek in 1938 as labor s power grew through the early 20th century and as technological innovations completely altered the nature of the workplace people began to fantasize about working even less than 40 hours prominent economists like john maynard keynes were even making utopian prophecies that we d all be working 15 hour weeks in the 21st century keynes s prediction wasn t based so much on the continued victories for labor as it was on a belief in increased productivity perhaps due to automation or perhaps in combination with other amazing human achievements steady increases in worker productivity would make it so that workers could simply work less and less until the weekday weekend ratio was flipped two days of work five days off keynes was one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and his ideas were taken very seriously but it s painfully clear that his prediction was dead wrong not only are we not working 15 hour weeks but we re also working more hours than we have any time since the post war era and it s not just here in the united states no country has a 15 hour workweek nowhere even comes close despite many technological advances and a steady increase in productivity we re working longer and longer hours what happened it was such a struggle for the early organized working class to originally shorten the workweek economic analyst doug henwood explained to truthout but since then it s just completely fallen off the radar as a demand of the labor movement and of course organized labor is so desperate at this point anyway that they re not really making many demands but even just that imagination of what we can do with a shorter workweek it s just largely disappeared from the conversation worker productivity has continued to climb higher and higher over the last century and although this trend was matched with an increase in wages at least up until the 1970s it never translated into a reduction in work hours we don t see payoff from increased productivity in the form of more leisure it s just more and more work henwood explained the tendency of capitalism especially in the american system is just to work more and harder we don t see payoff from increased productivity in the form of more leisure it s just more and more work the disconnect between productivity and a reduction of work hours can perhaps best be understood by examining the material conditions of american capitalism both how they manifest economically as well as how they translate into social values most importantly perhaps is to understand that as an employer it doesn t actually make sense to reduce your workers hours because in general the more you work the more money the boss makes henwood explained and i think that s the fundamental driving force of it they want to get as much out of workers as possible the class conflict between employers and employees is a core component of capitalism and helps to explain why any reduction in work hours generally had to be fought for inch by inch but there are some unique features of american capitalism which help to explain why the united states is so far behind any of the other industrialized nations in terms of work hours employers have lots of reasons why they want to keep workers working longer hours and in the u s there are a couple of structural features that really exacerbate that one of which is health care juliet schor professor of sociology at boston college told truthout in the united states health care is paid at the level of the business and on a per person basis so it makes sense for businesses to want fewer employees because they then have to pay those benefits to fewer people it s no surprise that the benefits of worker productivity and technological advances have been captured and hoarded at the top but it s not just health care another important part of it is that the u s developed a big salaried labor force last century schor explained salaried workers are paid a fixed amount so if they work longer hours the firm doesn t have to pay them more there really are just many different inbuilt biases toward long hours of work in the united states with the incentives for longer hours baked into the system itself it s not hard to understand why increased productivity and technological advances have not translated into shorter hours capitalism is not democratic those at the top have free reign to decide how to run their firms and it s no surprise that the benefits of worker productivity and technological advances have been captured and hoarded at the top surveys actually show that workers have wanted to use productivity growth and technological change to give themselves more free time but firms just don t give them that option schor told truthout there were lots of predictions from keynes all the way on even into the 1970s where people were predicting that work was going to disappear and of course we have another round of that today work is going to disappear with artificial intelligence and it really fails to recognize the extent to which firms set hours of work another significant factor contributing to longer hours in the united states is the way that americans view work itself hyperproductivity and overwork are celebrated in american culture and often seen as marks of greatness this emphasis on prioritizing work over all other aspects of life is a value that has been carefully manufactured by those whose interests lie in maximizing worker productivity and it s worked with great success there are way easier places to work but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week elon musk elonmusk november 26 2018 it feels like nose to the grindstone until you have no nose left henwood told truthout we ve become such creatures of the capitalist mindscape that we can t imagine anything beyond it there s an exhaustion of people s mental and spiritual life as a result of this focus on work and the way people define themselves in their work and career it s just had such a bankrupt way of looking at the world when you look at the data it s clear that working longer hours has all kinds of negative effects on individuals and on society as a whole studies have shown that the amount of work expected from the u s workforce contributes to sleep issues obesity and a weakened immune system working longer hours has also been linked to depression and heart related illness we are as it turns out literally working ourselves to death the benefits of shorter hours stretch beyond just the health and well being of individual workers there s a social multiplier effect that could result in many benefits to society as a whole imagine all of the time that could be devoted to strengthening community ties to civic engagement and political participation to the arts and a whole myriad of other activities that make life rich and meaningful shorter hours could also be a powerful policy tool when it comes to climate change current levels of economic growth and consumption are unsustainable if we want a habitable earth and one of the best ways to reduce growth is to simply work less if we re going to flatline or even start to degrow without mass unemployment you ve got to have a shorter working week schor told truthout we ve become such creatures of the capitalist mindscape that we can t imagine anything beyond it a recent report titled the ecological limits of work suggests that many countries would have to drastically reduce work hours in order to stay under 2 degrees of global warming the u k for example would have to move to a 9 hour workweek and sweden to a 12 hour workweek a shorter working week would also distribute paid work more evenly across the population allowing for paid and unpaid work to be more equally distributed between men and women for example and for more people to engage in unpaid care work for children or the elderly although not on the political agenda nearly as much as it was in previous centuries talk about shortening the workweek is starting to make appearances here and there mostly outside of the u s finland s newly elected prime minister sanna marin recently made a statement advocating for a flexible six hour day saying people deserve to spend more time with their families loved ones hobbies and other aspects of life such as culture this could be the next step for us in working life finland s neighbor sweden also just recently completed a study exploring the effects of a six hour day in one of its largest cities gothenburg there are other examples of firms or municipalities that have experimented with the idea in one form or another many of which have found successful outcomes even seeing higher worker productivity and the demand for a shorter workweek is also regaining some momentum in the united states with grassroots organizations like 4dayweekus starting to advocate for the idea on the national level but if a shortened workweek does ever remerge as a core component of the labor movement in the united states it would have to be part of a much broader list of demands that tackle issues like health care wage stagnation and climate change it would also have to be part of a significantly enlarged social democratic program instituted by the state that will provide people with the means to have their needs met most significantly it would mean changes have to be implemented in a just way perhaps through some kind of universal basic income program that would guarantee certain standards of living and finally it would also require a radical reimagining of how we conceive of work not just by rejecting the soul sucking back breaking work ethic that has been imposed upon us by from above but also in how we view the relationship between work and time more generally perhaps one of the rallying cries of the 21st century labor movement could be for the decommodification of time for our time to be returned to us to do with as we wish we re only here for a certain number of days and it s a little sad to spend it all on the job henwood told truthout just think of all the additional things people could do if we didn t have to work so damn much it really would be really nice wouldn t it before you go truthout faces a serious threat

on tuesday evening us president donald trump gave the annual state of the union address a special event whereby the president addresses both houses of congress accompanied by the vice president house of representatives speaker and members of the supreme court the address is notable for being used by the president to symbolically set the political agenda and issues of emphasis for the united states for the coming year including both on a domestic and foreign policy level of particular importance in this year s event is the fact that november brings the presidential election something which trump has ultimately set his sights on in line with that it is no surprise that trump devoted his state of union speech to boast about his apparent successes pertaining to the american economy aiming to whip up positivity acclaim and credence to the nation concerning the first four years of tenure in doing so he effectively declared victory in his trade struggles with china and declared the relationship with beijing to be the best it has ever been in addition the administration s foreign policy emphasis appears to be shifting back to latin america and the implementation of his neo monroe doctrine with the invitation of self appointed president of venezuela juan guaido and attacks on cuba and nicaragua in the view of trump s re election economy matters had more emphasis than any other topic at his state of the union address he focused exclusively on setting out the message that his economic policies have been a success and that the u s economy is better than it is ever been he boasted about job creation numbers and unemployment at an extensive length arguing that he had brought the country s economy out of decline through slashing regulations pursuing tax cuts and also fighting for american industries through his trade pursuits abroad including his renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta and his trade war with china he styled this as a blue collar boom however one cannot ignore the fact that very little of what he said had a basis in reality with u s gdp predicated to slump below two percent in 2020 in doing so trump did not whip up appetite for greater confrontation with beijing but in effect declared victory and praised the current state of relations arguing that his trade deal had secured new and vast export markets for american agricultural goods in declaring victory this is a key indicator that the trade war will not escalate further in 2020 however it also suggests he is happy to sit on what he has achieved politically so far which may complicate efforts towards a phase 2 either way china will not be a pressing issue for trump but this does not appear to coincide with the agendas and roles of those around him in the administration who are still eager to push an anti china line as mike pompeo is demonstrating however trump signaled that latin america will become an area of foreign policy emphasis throughout the year it is a tradition for the administration to invite key dissents and figures in areas they are focusing on to the state of the union address to send a message this year he selected their own appointed president of venezuela juan guaido and gave him a shout out saying he is the true and legitimate leader of the country whilst condemning the tyranny of nicholas maduro in doing so trump pledged democracy in our hemisphere vowing to continue the neo monroe doctrine the administration has pushed towards latin america aiming to uphold u s hegemony by targeting regimes that do not support their interests with condemnations for cuba and nicaragua meaning he reversed obama s reconciliatory policies apart from that though it is reasonable to observe that the state of the union was mostly one huge re election pitch from trump the president has now all but overcame his impeachment fiasco without receiving any serious political wounds and has his eyes firmly set on november as the speech illustrated he aims to do so by excessively and repeatedly championing what he claims has been a tremendously successful four years on his behalf as republicans cheered these statements and the democrats sat in silence while nancy pelosi noticeably looked almost disinterested he aims to convince a divided america that he is yet again their man and we should expect more of the same from here on

some republican candidates in one crowded house primary in tennessee are frustrated with new legislation on candidate residency that could disqualify some of them from the race with this new ridiculous law davy crockett wouldn t have even been able to run for congress again in tennessee if he had survived the alamo without waiting three years once moving home dave vitalli a tv actor and gop candidate for the 5th congressional district told nbc news the tennessee legislature on monday approved a bill requiring u s house and senate candidates to reside in the state for three years or more and in the county they re running in for at least one year in order to qualify to run it s not clear if gop gov bill lee will sign the bill into law his spokesperson laine arnold said the administration is reviewing the legislation some states add additional requirements on their candidates but if enacted the bill could face legal challenges for potentially violating the constitution which states members of the u s house must be at least 25 years old a u s citizen for at least seven years and live in the state they represent the new rule would disqualify at least two gop contenders in the competitive 5th district primary including vitalli who moved from new york to tennessee in 2021 morgan ortagus a former spokesperson for former president donald trump s state department who has trump s endorsement and who moved to tennessee last year would also be disqualified u s state department spokesperson morgan ortagus attends a press conference at the state department in washington on june 24 2020 mandel ngan pool via reuters file no one questioned my residency when i served our country in the intelligence community the trump administration nor in the u s navy reserves and president trump certainly didn t question my residency when he endorsed me for this seat ortagus said in a statement tuesday tennessee gop state sen frank niceley who sponsored the bill said that despite criticism of the residency requirement from some running for congress he has never received so much support for a piece of legislation and pointed to sizable majority votes in both chambers no one thinks it s a good idea to let people move in here and run for office niceley told nbc news it s one thing to know the interstates coming into a town which one of the candidates did not know but it s another thing to understand the culture but vitalli argues niceley is using his bill to bolster his candidate of choice in the 5th district republican primary former tennessee speaker of the house beth harwell it is a shame candidates are so weak that the only way they can win is to use their political cronies to pass laws that eliminate two of their top competitors vitalli said harwell may win due to these inside shenanigans but the real losers will be the tennessee voters that her and her cronies have stripped of a chance to have more choices at the ballot box asked about vitalli s accusation niceley demurred saying i think this is a good bill for future generations nine republicans have filed with the federal elections commission to run in the 5th district primary democratic rep jim cooper who currently represents the 5th district announced in january he is retiring at the end of his term after concluding there is no way for him to win under tennessee s new congressional map which divided nashville into three different districts the cook political report rates the new 5th district solid republican
bloomberg opinion almost all of asia s central bankers have said the economic risks from the wuhan coronavirus are significant then why aren t they all taking action in a slew of interest rate meetings this week policymakers have been all over the map thailand surprised most economists by reducing rates while the philippines cut and india held as anticipated the reserve bank of australia acknowledged the dangers to its commodities heavy economy but doesn t appear to be in a much of a hurry to do anything about it china quickly pumped liquidity into the financial system and lowered the money market policy rate when trading resumed monday there s a missed opportunity in this lack of a unified response which could accelerate a recovery from any economic hit the virus brings however despite many shared characteristics proximity to china as well as dependence on tourism investment and supply chains there are limits to policy integration in the monetary arena asia doesn t exist as a region the way europe does still in the most extreme examples some degree of coordination has been useful for example rates came down in the u s europe and china during the financial crisis of 2008 that commitment eventually stabilized markets and growth resumed i m not equating the virus to the great recession but joint firefighting can be a big confidence booster major powers also cooperated effectively to stabilize currency markets when japan s banking system cratered in 1998 and the euro crashed in 2000 we ll know the cavalry has really arrived if and when the federal reserve responds as i wrote this week the central bank should recognize that in an era of worrying about global developments a key reason cited for its 2019 cuts something that shuts down a broad swathe of china s economy is a rather big one the european central bank meanwhile has been circumspect peter praet a former top official expressed concerns about acting prematurely in response to the virus what worries me probably more the sort of perception you know especially in financial markets that central banks always have to react he said adding there s only so much a central bank can do story continues the caution is unfortunate but understandable many central banks eased considerably in 2019 and it s important not to make knee jerk decisions borrowing costs are low and there s something to be said for keeping powder dry for a truly dire scenario like a recession or financial shock but there s also a case for acting quickly precisely because rates are low if you allow a slowdown to take hold even more monetary weaponry might be required sooner the better philippine central bank governor benjamin diokno said in an interview with bloomberg news earlier this week in australia rates were cut three times last year to a record low 0 75 rba governor philip lowe is now worried that more reductions will inflate asset prices just when things may have bottomed in a series of speeches and presentations this week lowe signaled his preference for a period of masterful inactivity but china accounts for 40 of global growth and is australia s biggest customer lowe says the virus is a bigger worry than the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome which almost halved australia s growth rate in the second quarter of that year pity he s so reluctant to act after five rate cuts last year the reserve bank of india has made clear that it s uncomfortable with another cut amid an inflation spike as a substitute policymakers lowered lender reserve requirements and boosted money market funding still inflation has been declining in the major economies for decades and this spurt in india looks temporary the rbi should be able to look past it as i wrote last year a collapse in growth is the bigger threat the good news is that some central banks appear to be learning their lesson the bank of thailand has shown some nimbleness after moving too slowly last year to combat the strength of the baht governor veerathai santiprabhob made clear he isn t done after wednesday s quarter point reduction took the main rate to a record low of 1 what s clear is that asian policymakers aren t sitting around and waiting for the fed they nevertheless could stand to pick up the pace given the weight of china s economy valor may prove the better part of discretion to contact the author of this story daniel moss at dmoss bloomberg net to contact the editor responsible for this story rachel rosenthal at rrosenthal21 bloomberg net this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of bloomberg lp and its owners daniel moss is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering asian economies previously he was executive editor of bloomberg news for global economics and has led teams in asia europe and north america for more articles like this please visit us at bloomberg com opinion subscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source 2020 bloomberg l p
