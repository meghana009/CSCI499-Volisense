july 1944 as world war two raged finance chiefs from the world s main trading nations met in bretton woods new hampshire leer en español g7 en problemas 5 retos de la próxima cumbre that agreement signed july 22 was one of the first global monetary policy and currency agreements re establishing a gold standard for exchange rates backing away from competitive devaluations and setting up the international monetary fund to bridge balance of payments gaps but as the bretton woods pact turns 75 that spirit of cooperation whether on exchange rates or trade is waning trade protectionism is on the rise nationalism and unilateralism is championed by u s president donald trump who says the rest of the world is stealing from the united states via competitive currency devaluations against the dollar and so the july 17 18 meeting of g7 finance ministers and central bankers in the french town of chantilly could well be a fraught one taking place at the same time as imf and world bank heads join ecb officials in paris to commemorate bretton woods g7 discussions will focus less on the past and more on how to resolve pressing problems such as the world economy sino u s trade tensions fair

signs of pain from the trade war as recent data on producer prices and exports revealed monday s gdp data no matter how well massaged could show quarterly growth at its weakest in three decades and raise doubts over a government aim to keep 2019 growth in the 6 6 5 range beijing s monetary and fiscal stimulus has hitherto been a fraction of what it was during the 2015 downturn the government is clearly wary of encouraging another property bubble and reckless rise in investment both of which were targeted during the 2017 campaign to cut leverage but with worsening economic headlines falling corporate investment and a looming fed rate cut the people s bank of china cannot merely be operating behind the scenes through local government spending and liquid money markets many expect that a bold symbolic statement about beijing s policy easing intent is needed most certainly if the fed also cuts at the end of july even though that may just involve the customary token 10 basis points cut

thursday french lawmakers approved a tax on big tech companies potentially opening up a new front in a trade row between washington and the european union u s president donald trump has ordered an

robert lighthizer and treasury secretary mnuchin are beijing bound in the very near future markets worried over the impact of trade wars on the health of the global economy will be watching closely

ahead key economic data such as earnings growth inflation and retail sales will be closely watched by markets desperately trying to gauge where interest rates might be in a couple of years from now markets have nearly priced in a bank of england rate cut over the next 12 months after governor mark carney signalled he could be about to join other central banks in cutting rates economists expect year on year inflation for june to come in at 2 on wednesday but if the reading falls below the central bank s target rate of 2 chances of a rate cut may rise however other data is expected to come in a touch stronger average weekly earnings are expected to rise on tuesday by 3 2 year on year in the three months to may versus a 3 1 increase in april retail sales due out on thursday are expected have risen by 2 5 year on year in june after a 2 3 increase in may brexit of course remains the elephant in the room and is the main reason why sterling has fallen by 20 since june 2016 with the

millennium challenge corporation in sri lanka by c a chandraprema courtesy the island the controversy over the involvement of the millennium challenge corporation mcc in sri lanka has now come to a head mcc was created in the early years of the new millennium by the bush administration as an aid distribution programme for developing countries that are inclined to govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom the formation of the new body was in recognition of the fact that the us development assistance programmes which existed at the time had consistently failed to meet their stated goals despite decades of economic aid most recipients are poorer now than they were before first receiving development assistance from 1980 to 2000 the united states had disbursed 167 billion in aid to 156 developing countries but among the 97 countries for which reliable economic data for that period are available median per capita gross domestic product gdp had declined from 1 076 in 1980 to 994 in 2000 the mcc is thus supposed to be an experimental programme that seeks to explore new strategies to improve the effectiveness of development assistance programmes we now have the honour of being one of the guinea pigs testing out the efficacy of the aid programmes of mcc one complicating factor is that the american aid organisation will be investing only usd 480 million in sri lanka in a situation where the government s foreign borrowing through sovereign bonds during the first half of this year alone was usd 4 5 billion with a government that has borrowed not tens of millions but tens of billion of us dollars during a period of three or four years a grant of 480 million is too small even to register on the scale at the time the millennium challenge corporation was created in the early years of this millennium 300 or 400 million usd was considered a colossal amount of money in sri lanka the pledge of a concessionary loan from china of usd 300 million to build the first phase of the norochchcolai power plant during the last years of the chandrika kumaratunga government was welcomed at that time as a major breakthrough since that time much water has flown under the bridge and sri lanka has moved from being a low income country to an upper middle income country and the government that came into power in january 2015 commenced an era of mega foreign borrowings to pay for the election related government expenditure they incurred to win the 2015 august parliamentary election a grant of 480 million usd would have been a significant aid package during the rajapaksa government the present government would borrow 480 million usd in a single afternoon through the issue of sri lanka development bonds according to mcc criteria countries must qualify as low income or lower middle income countries according to the world bank s classification in order to be eligible for mcc grants on the 1st of july this year the world bank classified sri lanka as an upper middle income country with a per capita income in excess of 3 895 however by that time the mcc grant for sri lanka had already been passed and in any event according to mcc criteria when a country s classification changes it wil retain its former classification for a further two years veil of secrecy over mcc project as with everything else the controversy over the mcc project is largely due to the lack of transparency in the doings of the government ironically the mcc in selecting partner countries uses an indicator that measures a country s commitment among other things to the freedom of information yet the very thing that is missing about the agreement that has been entered into by this government and the mcc is information one would think that when the opposition and members of the general public begin to voice misgivings about a deal that the government has struck with some foreign party the first thing any government should do is to immediately launch a programme to explain to the public what the deal is about and how it is supposed to benefit sri lanka the controversy over the mcc has now been at the forefront of political discourse for months but the government has done nothing to enlighten the public the benefits that it is supposed to bestow on sri lanka as of now all that the public knows is that the usa will be giving sri lanka a grant of 480 million to carry out the work involved this grant was the silver lining that finance minister mangala samaraweera mangala saw in the dark cloud that covered sri lanka after the easter sunday bombings all that the public knows about this project is the limited information that is available on the mcc website what the website says is that mcc seeks to assist the sri lanka government in addressing two of the country s binding constraints to economic growth namely inadequate transport logistics infrastructure and planning and lack of access to land for agriculture the services sector and industrial investors the mcc website further states that the transport project aims to increase the relative efficiency and capacity of the road network and bus system in the colombo metropolitan region and to reduce the cost of transporting passengers and goods between the central region of the country and ports and markets in the rest of the country the stated goal of the land project is to increase the availability of information on private land and underutilized state lands or all land in sri lanka to which the government is lawfully entitled or which may be disposed of by the government in order to increase land market activity the mcc land project is supposed increase tenure security and tradability of land for smallholders women and firms through policy and legal reforms the picture that the public has of the transport project is that a road transport corridor is to be set up between the ports of colombo and trincomalee with the americans having an interest in the port of trincomalee neither the government nor the mcc has published anything that would enlighten the public any further even though money has been allocated for this project nobody has seen a proper project description or a diagram of how that effect is to be achieved while the mahaweli project was being built everybody knew what was being built and where if the efficiency and capacity of the road network and bus system in the colombo metropolitan region was to be improved and the cost of transporting passengers and goods between the central region of the country and ports and markets in the rest of the country was to be reduced that would give the government a much needed boost and one would think that they would have turned this into one of their main trumps in their re election bid as well yet the government has been inexplicably secretive about the whole mcc project the government s silence on what exactly is going to be done under this project is what is fuelling speculation and suspicion if it ain t broke why fix it the goal of the land project has been explicitly stated as seeking to increase the availability of information on private land and underutilized state lands or all land in sri lanka to which the government is lawfully entitled or which may be disposed of by the government the aim was to increase land market activity the land project is supposed to increase tenure security and tradability of land for smallholders women and firms the target clearly is state owned land in sri lanka we have freehold properties that belong to individuals or companies and then there is state owned land a portion of which is utilized directly by the government and a portion which remains allocated for other purposes of the republic such as forest reserves and the like and another potion of state land is held by the public under lease or licencing arrangements it is obviously the latter that the mcc is targeting even though such state owned lands have been alienated to individuals under licensing or long term lease arrangements the tenants on these lands enjoy security of tenure because the government will not simply kick them off the land if it is cultivated and used productively the lease holder or lisencee will be adequately compensated before the government takes back a state land which has been given to private individuals for farming or other purposes we almost never hear of even the smallest of smallholders being unreasonably evicted from state owned land that had been leased or given to them on a license by the state furthermore the state owned land given out to individuals can change hands and be sold there is a separate market for leasehold or licenced land holdings with the price being somewhat lower than in the case of freehold land such land can also be passed down from generation to generation provided the land had been utilized productively when the department of rural development and land reform in south africa proposed an overhaul of the country s land holding system what they proposed was that state land be under lease hold and private land be under freehold with limited extent while foreign ownership should be linked to productivity and partnership models with south african citizens that is much like the system that prevails in sri lanka at present if something is not broken why try to mend it admittedly recipients of state owned land on lease will face issues when trying to raise money from banks with the land pledged as surety banks prefer freehold land only the high value customers with a proven track record would stand a chance of being able to raise money by pledgeing a lease on a state owned land as surety in such an environment startups would have little or no chance however one would think that this was a problem that had to be dealt with at the level of the banks instead of trying to give leaseholders freehold tenure if leaseholds on state land can be bought and sold between citizens of sri lanka and their only problem is the inability to use that lease as collateral the answer to that can t be the wholesale transformation of such lands into freehold tenures there is besides the well founded fear that if state owned lands which are at present farmed by individuals on leasehold or lisencing arrangements are turned into freehold properties it will not be long before unscrupulous elements lay their hands on these lands creating a landless rural population the fact that the land is owned by the state discourages fragmentation of the land and strategic buying up of cheap land by organized parties as what happened in palestine before the creation of israel in a country like ours this is a paramount consideration when discussing land policy in this country even a leasehold land has a monetary value which is below the value of a similar freehold property and the banks should be encouraged to lend to leaseholders at least to the extent of the reduced value of the land without turning away leaseholders wholesale when we look at the land rights and access indicator of the mcc we see that the kind of land reform that they have in mind would be applicable to countries in sub saharan africa which don t even have governments worth the name rather than countries like ours the mcc s access to land indicator assesses the extent to which the institutional and legal framework provides secure land tenure and equitable access to land in rural areas they look at the extent to which the law guarantees secure tenure for land rights of the poor the extent to which the law guarantees secure land rights for women and other vulnerable groups the extent to which land is titled and registered etc sri lanka has no major issues with regard to any of those benchmarks the mcc also looks at how long it takes to register property and the time taken to transfer the property title from the seller to the buyer so that the buyer can use the title for expanding business as collateral in taking new loans or if necessary to sell to another business sri lanka does not have any major issues with regard to such matters either the mcc also looks at the cost to register property as a percentage of the value of the property the latter is one area where vast improvement is needed in sri lanka not because of the cost in registering the land per se but in the duties charged by our exploitative government on land transactions which drives up the transaction cost that however is a matter that only the sri lankan government can address the exorbitant duties charged on land transactions goes for the maintenance of the white elephants known as the provincial councils most people doing land transactions would have found that the provincial council does not necessarily accept the cost of the land as stated on the deed but they do a valuation on their own and the tax that has to be paid is calculated on the basis of that estimated value the only genuine problem that sri lankans have with regard to land tenure and other issues is the exploitative attitude of the government which seeks to make a killing off land transactions the mcc states that secure land tenure gives people long term incentives to invest and to use land as collateral for loans sri lanka s rand reform laws enacted in the 1970s was instrumental in fixing a ceiling on land ownership according to the land reform laws no 1 of 1972 and no 39 of 1975 brought by the then slfp government the maximum extent of agricultural land which may be owned by any person was twenty five acres of paddy land and fifty acres of other agricultural land there have been strident calls for the abolition of this ceiling in order to encourage commercial agriculture that too is not something that would require the intervention of a foreign donor organization cloak and dagger development work the mcc which uses an indicator that measures a country s commitment to the freedom of information in order to qualify for a programme has been very reticent with information on what exactly it is doing in sri lanka the mcc freedom of information indicator measures a government s commitment to enable or allow information to move freely in society this indicator is based on the degree of press freedom the status of national freedom of information laws and a measure of internet filtering the mcc website even has a lecture on how information flows relate to growth and poverty reduction the following is what the mcc says about the importance of free information flows governments play a role in information flows they can restrict or facilitate information flows within countries or across borders many of the institutions laws regulations codes of conduct that governments design are created to manage the flow of information in an economy countries with better information flows often have better quality governance and less corruption higher transparency and access to information have been shown to increase investment inflows the mcc uses several indicators to measure a country s eligibility for grants including the freedom of information mentioned earlier among the other indicators are the following ruling justly prevalence of free and fair electoral processes political pluralism and participation of all stakeholders government accountability and transparency freedom from domination by the military foreign powers totalitarian parties religious hierarchies and economic oligarchies and the political rights of minority groups civil liberties freedom of expression and belief association and organizational rights rule of law and human rights and personal autonomy and economic rights government effectiveness the quality of public service provision civil servants competency and independence from political pressures and the government s ability to plan and implement sound policies among other things rule of law the extent to which the public has confidence in and abides by the rules of society the incidence and impact of violent and non violent crime the effectiveness independence and predictability of the judiciary the protection of property rights and the enforceability of contracts control of corruption grand corruption in the political arena the frequency of petty corruption the effects of corruption on the business environment and the tendency of elites to engage in state capture among other things there are also some economic indicators such as the following fiscal policy government borrowing as a percent of the gdp averaged over a three year period inflation the most recent average annual change in consumer prices regulatory quality the burden of regulations on business price controls the government s role in the economy and foreign investment regulation trade policy openness to international trade based on average tariff rates and non tariff barriers to trade land rights and access the institutional legal and market framework to provide secure land tenure and equitable access to land in rural areas and the time and cost of property registration in urban and peri urban areas according to sri lanka s scorecard for 2019 published on the mcc website sri lanka has passed the tests for political rights civil liberties control of corruption government effectiveness and the rule of law sl has failed the tests for the freedom of information which is not surprising given how little information there is about what mcc is doing in sri lanka when it comes to the economic indicators sl has passed the tests for inflation regulatory quality trade policy business start up but failed on fiscal policy land rights and access to credit

if local conditions worsen trade all the major global economic data live and interactive at the dailyfx webinars we d love to have you along usd asean week recap the us dollar underperformed against its major and most of its asean counterparts this past week dovish testimony from fed chair jerome powell to congress and the latest fomc meeting minutes helped prepare markets for the highly anticipated rate cut later this month this is despite better than expected local cpi and ppi data which helped to cool some concerns about muted inflationary pressures a notable exception was the indian rupee which depreciated despite better than expected headline inflation data prices in india rose 3 18 y y in june versus 3 13 anticipated which was the fastest pace since october 2018 what seemed to drive selling pressure in the currency was subhash chandra garg india s economic affairs secretary who said that the fiscal deficit target for 2020 was higher at 3 55 meanwhile the singapore dollar briefly depreciated after singapore s economy unexpectedly contracted by the most since 2012 raising concerns over the outlook for domestic inflation in indonesia the rupiah saw strength after president jokowi announced plans for corporate tax cuts this likely cooled bank of indonesia rate cut bets though keep in mind that they are heavily intervening to guard idr the malaysian ringgit

indonesia rate decision ahead top tier scheduled event risk for the asean region is second quarter growth data for china s economy last week we saw imports from the world s second largest economy contract over 7 percent in usd terms this is more than the 4 6 estimated decline anticipated by economists and speaks to rising concerns about domestic demand in an economy that is shifting towards a consumer oriented powerhouse data results in china are still tending to disappoint relative to economists expectations according to citigroup this opens the door to a softer print in second quarter gdp which is already estimated to slow to 6 2 y y from 6 4 that is the weakest pace of expansion since at least 1992 and this could dampen growth prospects for some of its trading partners nearby such as singapore which is already struggling the philippines malaysia indonesia and singapore all have china as part of their top 5 trading partners the former two countries have already cut interest rates at least once this year to help support economic activity something to keep in mind is that prospects of cheaper credit from the united states can alleviate financial pressure in emerging markets for the time being which may help counter frets over weak chinese growth later in the week the bank of indonesia is expected to reduce its 7 day reverse repo rate from 6 00 to 5 75 though as mentioned earlier corporate tax cuts could lessen the haste for policymakers to keep reducing rates but what arguably matters the most for the indonesian rupiah is commentary on their fx target which is 14 000 14 400 per usd this year usd idr is hovering precariously at the lower bound external event risk as we saw this past week relatively supportive us inflation data was not enough to deter aggressive easing bets from the federal reserve according to fed fund futures there is still a roughly 20 percent chance of a 50 basis point cut at the end of this month as such absent significant surprises in upcoming local retail sales and sentiment data the us dollar may focus more on central bank commentary and risk trends chair jerome powell is scheduled to speak at the bank of france with commentary from policymakers spread out throughout the week markets will be closely watching for how aggressive the central bank may resort to easing in the months ahead keep in mind that 3 cuts by year end are almost fully priced in by markets even with inflation not too far off from the central bank s target core pce is at 1 6 vs 2 0 as such if economic conditions continue to deteriorate in the world s largest economy amidst the backdrop of trade wars and weak global growth the us dollar could catch a haven bid the earnings season begins with banks reporting and they could fret about lower profit margins if interest rates fall too much concerns over trade wars may also be mentioned which could dampen sentiment fx trading resources written by daniel dubrovsky currency analyst for

risk appetite was juiced last week by two days of testimony from us fed chair jerome powell in which the fed head all but confirmed it would be cutting interest rates at its july 31st meeting that s bolstered hope that fresh liquidity is set to flow through the financial system to pump up asset prices across the globe 1 market sentiment still buy everything wall street equities ended the week with the wind at their back registering fresh record highs while other global stock markets remain around year to date highs ultimately the financial markets belong to the bulls as the buy everything mantra that has encompassed several weeks of trade remains prevalent 2 risks to the outlook remain but the bulls control on price action must be considered tenuous it s because the essential contradiction remains yes easy money is likely to be injected into markets however fundamentals still appear to be deteriorating market participants now confront us earnings season out of which analysts are expecting earnings growth on a year on year basis to contract by 2 7 per cent the winding down of the global economic slowdown which has certainly been exacerbated by the pernicious effects of a global deterioration in international trade relations is becoming apparent in corporate profits the central concern for markets therefore remains the opposing forces of fresh liquidity versus diminishing profitability 3 global equities stay strong nevertheless on the week global stocks performed well us indices are at record highs with the s p500 on friday breaking through the psychological barrier of 3000 points and the dow jones extending its climb above 27000 points price action in other major indices was more subdued it must be said but for now the upward trend remains the asx200 experienced slightly more sluggish trading conditions closing the week s trade below the 6700 mark though it remains in what can only be described as an upward trend a climb in australian government bond yields and the australian dollar were the biggest culprits behind this dynamic 4 rates markets dealing with mixed information on global bond and interest rate markets price action in that asset class was slightly more complex the reasoning centres around the circumstances naturally in the us economy yields are being suppressed somewhat by the pricing in of imminent interest rate cuts from the us federal reserve however the enthusiasm related to that fact was tempered last week after us cpi data printed stronger than expected and forced traders to rethink the capacity central banks will have to cut as hard as markets would like the overall result was a steepening of the yield curve which incidentally proved positive for financial stocks last week 5 fx markets revolve around weaker dollar the powerful words of us fed chair jerome powell ultimately held the greatest weight of all and that brought about weakness in us dollar last week that was undoubtedly beneficial for us equities and supported their rally on friday it also managed to place a little support under commodity prices which manifested in commodity currencies the australian dollar rallied edging towards month to date highs the yen remains in vogue amidst anxiety about the global economic outlook trading into the 107 handle again the euro also edged higher solely because of the weaker greenback and the pound is into the 1 25 handle but remains in a downtrend amidst soft uk fundamentals 6 commodities tell a few stories the combination of a lower us dollar and a renewed swelling in the pool of negative yielding debt in global financial markets prompted a rally in gold prices again last week with the price of the yellow metal looking increasingly comfortable above us1400 oil prices climbed owing to a bigger than expected drawdown in us crude oil inventories last week tensions between iran and the west and a storm ripping through the gulf of mexico while industrial metals climbed continuing it s post g20 meeting bounce although it must be said seem to be trading with a long term trend to the downside

hearing unemployment has fallen three full points since 2014 but inflation is no higher today than it was five years ago that s because we have solved inflation it is no longer a problem macro

fed chair jerome powell advertisement the economy can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than we thought without troubling inflation powell responded that really is the headline here inflation no longer exists we should be living in the weimar republic but we re not inflation is gone even 10 years of interest rates set near zero no longer generates consumer price increases the textbooks of

we solved it through our new inventions spotify makes music cheaper uber makes taxis cheaper google makes information cheaper facebook makes advertising cheaper amazon makes shopping cheaper the gig

workers who want nominal pay rises that notion that inflation is extinct is not obvious in a note to clients last week nomura analysts rob subbaraman and andrew ticehurst said major central banks seem

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news stresses in china seem to be building and quite quickly firstly their trade balance swelled yet again reaching us 50 bln with the rest of the world in june but not in a good way their export growth dipped 1 3 pretty much in line with expectations but their imports fell 7 3 and much more than expected and compounding the large may decline in the sensitive trade with the us china s surplus is growing and growing in the past six months china s exports to the american have fallen just a bit more than 8 year on year to just under us 200 bln in total on the other hand imports from the us dropped almost 30 to 59 bln the result has been a much wider trade surplus with the americans of us 140 bln on the trade numbers alone china is the clear winner here the us farm belt the clear loser but those trade numbers also point to an economy that seems to be running out of the steam that trade once drove at 2 pm today a raft of key economic data will be released including q2 gdp retail sales and industrial production and they will set the tone for china over the next month and overnight it became clear that huawei is hurting more than they are letting on giant us contract manufacturer flextronics which makes huawei mobile phones in changsha in hunan province in central china has all but shut down a key plant that is central to huawei s new product launches it is also laying off staff in the us of course beijing is not sitting idly by as these pressures build they are making sure debt funding is available and new yuan loans for june were up 13 probably at double the rate of their economic growth china s answer to stress always seems to be more debt and staying in china international credit ratings agencies can now rate domestic chinese securities all part of china s opening up but the first s p rating is raising some eyebrows it is for the leasing division of state owned bank icbc and s p china gave it a aaa rating the raised eyebrow is because s p global had previously rated the same chinese company s debt as a true that was five years ago but the difference is getting attention are higher ratings the cost of these international agencies getting permission to operate there one place being hit particularly hard by the trade war is singapore q2 2019 economic activity has fallen down 3 4 and way below analyst expectations it is a substantial shift from the 3 8 growth in the first quarter in the region however singapore might be a bit of an outlier not all asean or south asian economies are shifting like this not yet at least in the us wall street ended last week on a high a record high with the s p500 pushing up over the 3000 index level investors are preparing for a good earnings season and the powell congressional testimony has most investors thinking a rate cut at the end of the month is now locked in meanwhile american producer prices rose only modestly for the second straight month in june as an acceleration in the cost of services up 2 5 was offset by cheaper energy down 7 1 those falling oil prices mean overall producer inflation gained their least in nearly 2½

the digital economy is relevant to all economic activities in the country since it is the main pillar of the emerging economic system in the globe sri lanka cannot ignore its presence hence sri lanka s future economic prosperity depends on how far the country is able to surf in the modern digital world and adopt high digital technology to its production methods calling sri lanka an agriculture based country is a misnomer a widely held view by many sri lankans is that sri lanka was an agriculture based economy in the past and it should be so even in the future the first part of this argument is only half true the second one has been presented without proper understanding of how economies are being framed in the future a clue to this second one was given by a young researcher attached to the institute of policy studies or ips kithmina hewage in a recent interview with biz in focus hosted by a popular television channel in the country available at the young researcher revealed that the fourth industrial revolution is in its full swing now with its main ingredients involving artificial intelligence robotisation and adoption of itc for production distribution and consumption if sri lanka does not attune itself to this new wave the result will be catastrophic for the island economy sri lanka created prosperity in the past via trade from ancient times sri lanka was a country which had depended on both agriculture and trade for prosperity even prior to the colonisation of the island by migrants from india there is evidence that it was visited by traders who had brought goods from the rest of the world and taken away the produce bought from local residents the two main functions of trade according to the great chronicle of sri lanka mahavansa prince vijaya and his attendants had been served with a rice meal by local princess kuweni having cooked it out of rice salvaged from ships that had been sea wrecked though the country had cultivated grains and other essential food items within the island by using man made irrigation schemes such production had run into shortages very often prompting it to import them from india and siam now known as thailand hence the country sustained its prosperity by tapping in to its location advantage of being on a convenient naval route that had connected the east with the west accordingly the goods produced in all the countries in the naval route had been brought to sri lanka stored in trading centres and sold at a profit to visiting traders in modern times this trade is known as entrepot trade in which trading centres like singapore and dubai have been specialised today as reported by the egyptian geographer idris during the reign of the king parakramabahu i from 1153 ce to 1186 alcohol had been brought to sri lanka from a land known as arak the king had bought all that alcohol and established a monopoly in the commodity then it had been resold to traders at prices fixed by him during the portuguese and the dutch periods the same trade pattern had continued since that was the lifeline of the island during the british period too the country depended on foreign trade for sustenance and prosperity with the exception of three tree crops tea rubber and coconut being introduced as the country s new export products till about mid 1980s the country s economic structure depended on these three crops a promising economy at the time of independence when sri lanka became independent from the british in 1948 in comparison to other south asian countries it was a nation of promise envied by its peers the british had left the nation with a well organised and well disciplined civil service that could serve the nation as its main pillar of economic growth it had inherited from the british a massive volume of foreign exchange assets sufficient for paying for 17 months of future imports the country s indebtedness which has been the bane of the nation today had been at a very low level foreign debt at 4 of gdp and local debt at 14 of gdp the government budget was in a very healthy position with an average deficit of about 2 of gdp the rupee was exchanged for the us dollar at the rate of rs 3 32 per dollar thus sri lanka had all the prerequisites for a fast growing economy having taken these favourable factors into account a visiting world bank delegation had recommended to the government in 1952 that since sri lanka would not be able to absorb all the people joining the labour force through agriculture alone it should take measures to develop both power and energy and industries it was this recommendation that was ignored by sri lanka in the few decades to come failure to continue with structural changes after the open economy policy was adopted by sri lanka in late 1977 there was some structural change in its economy the country s reliance on the three tree crops for earning the bulk of foreign exchange about 90 and producing national output more than a third was reduced significantly instead a new industry in the form of textiles and apparels was added to the country s industrial sector thereby increasing the share of industry in the total output close to 30 and in export earnings to about a half of total exports simultaneously the services sector specifically the banking finance and insurance on one side and trading activities on the other was expanded significantly making it an important contributor to national output as well as to economic growth sri lanka s future depends not on re establishing a feudalistic agri economy but a globally connected high technology involving digital economy even to modernise agriculture sri lanka has to introduce technology to agriculture at present it is only those who have dropped out of schools that have gone into agriculture today it is necessary to equip this group with modern cultivation and farm management methods both of which come from new technology when the productivity of the agricultural sector improves due to the adoption of new farming methods the average costs of farm products will fall increasing farmers profit margins it will make farming an attractive occupation these structural changes had helped sri lanka to connect itself to the global economy to some extent as it had done during ancient times however sri lanka had failed to take this momentum forward and be a rising partner of the global economy as many east asian economies notably singapore south korea taiwan hong kong china and malaysia had done in the last few decades today sri lanka is being threatened in the global markets by new entrants like thailand and vietnam this unsavoury development in fact amounts to degeneration of sri lanka s position from being a leader to a laggard in the global arena challenges faced by textiles and apparel industry the textiles and apparel industry helped sri lanka in the three decades beginning from 1980 to address many of the burning issues the country s economy had been facing provision of employment to rising labour force supplementing foreign exchange earnings and making an important contribution to country s economic growth however this industry is facing two challenges today one is coming from within the economy domestically and the other from external developments over which sri lanka has no control rising wage costs and eroding competitiveness the domestically emerging challenge is the erosion of its competitiveness due to rising labour costs thus it is losing markets to new entrants like bangladesh and cambodia which still are blessed with a pool of workers who are willing to work for relatively low wages for instance a garment worker in sri lanka expects a monthly emolument of about 200 in bangladesh a factory owner can hire a worker for half that emolument as a result sri lanka s garment manufacturers are now shifting their investments to overseas destinations with no new investments forthcoming the textile and apparel industry will be a slowly dying force in the years to come bazaar effect making industrial nations just traders the external challenge is the development of a new production system in the textiles and apparel sector in the global economy this industry shifted from the major markets in developed countries to low wage developing countries in early 1970s to take advantage of the low costs prevalent in the latter group of countries this production process came to be known as outsourcing or off shoring however as the german economist hans werner sinn presented in 2006 in a paper titled the pathological export boom and the bazaar effect how to solve the german puzzle published in the world economy the outsourcing process has resulted in converting developed countries to bazaars that do only trading and not manufacturing the result has been the loss of manufacturing employment from the developed world to developing countries the discontent among the voters in developed countries has been successfully exploited by the crafty politicians who have now waged war against outsourcing of industrial production to the developing world trumponomics coming to prominence in usa today is a good example for this emerging wave the pressure exerted by the political authorities in the developed world to shift manufacturing industry back to their own shores is now gaining ground and it cannot be ignored anymore by the manufacturers in that part of the world on shoring and near shoring of the textiles and apparel industry in the case of the textiles and apparel industry this has been facilitated by new developments in automation and artificial intelligence accordingly the textiles and apparel industry is returning to the developed world in a production process now known as on shoring or re shoring as against the previous off shoring according to a report published by eurofound a research arm of the european union in 2019 under the title the future of manufacturing in europe during 2014 8 a total of 146 cases of re shoring has taken place in four major economies in europe namely uk italy france and germany available at location of production close to markets near shoring there is another development that has caused the industry to get shifted to countries close to the major markets in a report published by mckinsey institute in 2018 under the title is apparel manufacturing coming home it has been found that the need for having manufacturing facilities close to markets has shifted them to nearby countries in a process known as near shoring available at since a garment product produced in sri lanka china or bangladesh takes at least 30 days to reach markets in europe or north america the transit time has been cut to 3 days by locating these factories in countries close to the markets accordingly europe is being served by on shored factories in the uk portugal and macedonia and near shored factories in turkey tunisia and morocco similarly north american markets are served by on shored factories in usa and near shored factories in mexico guatemala honduras and el salvador the mckinsey institute has estimated that by 2025 about 55 of the global textiles and apparel trade will take place under the on shoring and near shoring production system this is surely a formidable challenge to sri lanka s textiles and apparel industry the fourth industrial revolution the world is entering today the fourth industrial revolution a term coined by the convenor of the global economic forum klaus schwab by his 2016 book under the same title according to schwab the world is now filled with new technologies like ubiquitous mobile supercomputing intelligent robots self driving cars neuro technological brain enhancements genetic editing and many more these new technologies are changing the way people live work or relate to each other the artificial intelligence and machine learning robotisation will turn the present production methods upside down many will lose their jobs those who study today to get employed in a particular job in later life will find those jobs disappearing once they complete their studies with machine learning artificial intelligence and robotisation jobs will be transferred from labour abundant developing countries to labour deficient developed countries whether sri lanka likes it or not it cannot insulate itself from the consequences of the oncoming fourth industrial revolution all it can do is to prepare itself to face the new change and become an active partner of the global production methods the global production sharing networks the emerging production method is that components for a final product is produced in a number of production units located in the same country or in different countries accordingly no country is able to claim ownership to any particular product today for instance it has been documented that parts for iphone 6 have come from 400 odd production units located in more than 40 countries while it is finally assembled in a factory called foxconn located in china hence iphone 6 can claim itself that it is a global product assembled in china this is traditionally known as the global supply chain but the sri lanka born economist prema chandra athukorala calls it global production sharing network since the whole world gets together to share the fruits of such products sri lanka s future depends on how successfully it can join this network need for acquiring technology already east asian countries like singapore malaysia thailand and vietnam have become partners of this global production sharing network the prerequisite needed by a country to join this network is the acquisition and adoption of high technology a country can acquire technology by getting it from the rest of the world or developing it domestically sri lanka s present capacity to develop technology domestically is limited and therefore the country should acquire it from others who have developed it one way to get technology from outside is to buy it from foreign developers but it involves making regular payments to them hence the more cost effective manner of acquiring technology is to invite foreign business firms that have developed new technology to invest in sri lanka or get into bilateral economic partnership programs a likely candidate for this is the manufacturing of a battery which is more powerful but smaller in size and lighter in weight to store solar energy for subsequent use and power all the electrical vehicles that would be the main mode of transport in a few decades given the present state of sri lanka s economy the attraction of this type of technology to the country is a must today future is clear for sri lanka hence sri lanka s future depends not on re establishing a feudalistic agri economy but a globally connected high technology involving digital economy even to modernise agriculture sri lanka has to introduce technology to agriculture at present it is only those who have dropped out of schools that have gone into agriculture today it is necessary to equip this group with modern cultivation and farm management methods both of which come from new technology when the productivity of the agricultural sector improves due to the adoption of new farming methods the average costs of farm products will fall increasing farmers profit margins it will make farming an attractive occupation join the digital economy the digital economy is relevant to all economic activities in the country since it is the main pillar of the emerging economic system in the globe sri lanka cannot ignore its presence hence sri lanka s future economic prosperity depends on how far the country is able to surf in the modern digital world and adopt high digital technology to its production methods the writer a former deputy governor of the central bank of sri lanka can be reached at

federal reserve board chairman jerome powell testifies during a full committee hearing on monetary policy and the state of the economy on july 10 2019 in washington dc uncertainty about trade frictions and global growth continues to weigh on the us economic outlook federal reserve chair jerome powell said on july 10 keeping the door open to an interest rate cut this month in his highly anticipated testimony to congress powell said many central bankers believed the case for lower rates had strengthened last month given the rising crosscurrents in the economy in 2008 the united states unleashed the global financial crisis which nearly upended the world economy and came to be known as the great recession the problems that created it weren t solved but swept under the carpet over the past ten years new bubbles have been inflating in place of the ones that burst back then now america is about to visit another massive crisis upon the world it will be the continuation of the first one in the same way that the two world wars of the first half of the 20th century should be seen as a single conflict with a long truce in between last week when jerome powell chairman of the u s federal reserve testified before congress alexandria ocasio cortez a progressive member of congress from new york asked him about the lowest sustainable rate of unemployment i e how low unemployment can go before it triggers inflation in mainstream economics unemployment and inflation are related through the phillips curve which requires inflation to rise as the jobless rate goes down in recent years the relationship seems to have broken down as the unemployment rate fell reaching a 50 year low inflation declined as well so the fed kept reducing the safe rate of unemployment and powell claimed that joblessness could go even lower before the fed begins to worry about inflation powell s response was fudged it had to be because in truth the traditional scholarly framework of economics perfected during the early decades after world war ii has fallen apart for all the learned mambo jumbo powell mouthed during his congressional testimony the fed in its management of the economy is groping its way in the dark the economic situation defies economic orthodoxy and a more accurate framework to understand what is happening is yet to be developed and without understanding why things are working the way they are it is impossible to develop effective policies donald trump who feels that the strong us economy will get him re elected in 2020 has been demanding that powell cut us interest rates the rudderless fed looks likely to comply at the end of july and to ease once more before the end of the year except for appearing to cave in to trump s unprecedented demands as the u s political establishment has done repeatedly since his election anyway powell is treading upon familiar ground loose money and loose dollars above all have shaped the global economy and defined the development of society over the past four decades the 1970s and the early 1980s were defined by the struggle against inflation but inflation which economists believed was a universal phenomenon connected to paper money turned out to be associated with the more egalitarian and tightly regulated economy of the time supply of goods and services was restricted by regulation while workers received compensation which exceeded their productivity more money chasing a set quantity of goods led to price increases in retrospect it is clear that in the 1980s inflation was brought under control not so much by draconian interest rates as by social change alan greenspan appointed fed chairman by reagan in the mid 1980s gradually realized that he could keep flooding the economy with cheap money without the fear of triggering inflation cheap dollars may not have engendered social change but they certainly greased the slides thanks to low interest rates the high tech revolution was greatly accelerated new technology boosted productivity and put further downward pressure on inflation similarly plentiful liquidity and plentiful investment funds didn t cause but sped up the emergence of china as a cheap global manufacturing hub technological progress and information technology allowed companies to build up production capacities quickly and to produce everywhere around the world creating highly efficient supply chains that allowed them to keep prices low unlike the previous era workers didn t get the monetary benefits of higher productivity they got cheaper goods but the profits went to those who controlled technology or could take advantage of the cheap money that the fed along with other central banks was pouring into the global financial system thus progressively low interest rates have also been responsible for the rise of the international super rich class the only problem with this type of monetary policy is that it devalues money and creates financial bubbles in the post depression period that ended in the 1980s central bankers would raise the price of money every time financial bubbles were in danger of developing william mcchesney martin post world war ii fed chairman famously said that the central bank s job is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going the new thinking at the fed and other central banks has been to spike the punch with more alcohol to make sure the party doesn t end this has created progressively more dangerous bubbles the crisis of the early 1990s was moderate the dot com bust in the early 2000s was more severe and the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis followed by the euro zone debt crisis was a major economic social and political debacle each time the crisis whose origins had been easy money was addressed by throwing even more easy money at them trillions of dollars worth of liquidity have been poured into the global financial system since 2008 a new depression has been avoided and the world economy has recovered but at a significant cost a tremendous social divide has opened up between the elites and the people for the elites money has been devalued turning one dollar of ca 1975 into an equivalent of one cent today we now have three distinct economies with three distinct growth unemployment and inflation rates one for the super wealthy one for the elites and one for the people all those economies look very different and whether you believe the economy is working depends on which one of the three economies you inhabit the anger resentment and economic fears of those who have been left behind gave rise in recent years to a wave of political populism propelling right wing parties to power in the us and the u k where those economic trends have been most pronounced they have led to a bona fide political earthquake now the fed is moving to ease its monetary policy once more this comes at the height of the longest economic expansion in us history when unemployment is at a historic low loose monetary policy complements extremely loose fiscal policy at a time of full employment and record corporate profits the federal government is running trillion dollar deficits meanwhile financial markets both bonds and stocks are in a liquidity driven bubble stage when such extreme measures are needed to prolong the life of existing bubbles it is a sign that the endgame is at hand we don t know when it will come what will trigger the reckoning and what form it will take the only thing that can be said in the words of another prominent economist of the post world war ii era things that can t go on forever usually don t

many central banks are rethinking their approach to the environmental and social impact of their operations this is because their decisions can affect access to housing healthcare education work to adequate food and water and the security of their pensions at the one planet summit in paris two years ago a network of central banks and supervisors was set up with the main focus on climate change now with 40 members from five continents the network is drawn to pay more attention to other environmental and social considerations the precise mandates of central banks vary but one thing they all have in common is responsibility for maintaining price stability their primary policy tools for achieving this objective are interest rates the capital and reserve requirements for banks and trading debt instruments in financial markets central banks also act as a lender of last resort to the banking system or more generally to the financial sector they regulate and supervise the activities of banks and other financial institutions they manage the country s payment system maintain financial stability and manage the country s foreign exchange reserves in some countries the central bank can be given additional responsibilities such as promoting development finance or financial inclusion to fully understand the risk that climate poses to price and financial stability central banks need to consider how changing weather patterns will affect a number of variables these include food production migration patterns and people s access to food water housing and jobs and how these in turn influence aggregate demand credit allocation inflation and government deficits in other words as i explain in more detail in this article central bankers are being inexorably pushed to reconsider the relationship between central banking and human rights the connections the mandates powers and governance arrangements of all central banks are established by law they must comply with all the applicable law including the constitutional and international legal obligations of their home states in principle this means that central banks are bound by the international human rights commitments of their sovereigns historically central banks have been able to avoid dealing with human rights issues this is because the political leadership determines the price stability goal for the economy and then lets the central bank decide how to meet this inflation objective this arrangement suggests that the central bank s independence is limited to the technical issues relevant to achieving the goal set by the government in addition it assumes at least implicitly that the social and environmental implications of the country s monetary and financial goals are the government s responsibility however in reality central banking is not a purely technical function for example the social and environmental impact of its decision to change interest rates will vary depending on how it implements the decision if the central bank decides to change interest rates through open market operations the social and environmental impacts will depend on which instruments it chooses to trade and in what proportions on the other hand these affects will depend on the decisions of banks if it implements the decision by changing the reserve requirements or the interest rate it charges banks for short term loans there are some noteworthy examples the central banks of kenya the netherlands and the federal reserve bank of san francisco consider factors such as community development and financial inclusion in their stewardship of their financial systems and the dutch central bank now has a mandate to include sustainability in its decision making the chinese central bank has been authorised to take climate considerations into account in its monetary decisions central bank operations therefore cannot avoid affecting human rights the human rights responsibilities the unavoidable impact of central banking operations on human rights means that central banks have to develop a better understanding of their human rights responsibilities the applicable law is the starting point but the relevant law and jurisprudence is unlikely to provide detailed guidance on how central banks should interpret and implement their human rights responsibilities a good reference tool for the central bank is the un guiding principles on business and human rights these principles stipulate that all businesses should have a human rights policy the policy should be publicly available and should be applicable to all the business s operations and decision making the principles also state that businesses should conduct adequate human rights due diligence before and during their decision making and implementation process this requirement means that they should conduct human rights impact assessments of their proposed operations they should also take steps to avoid or mitigate the identified adverse human rights impacts central banks will face particular challenges in meeting their human rights responsibilities their instrument independence means that their human rights policy will need to be respectful of the central bank s independence and its mandate at the same time the central bank needs to be cognisant of the fact that its human rights policy may have implications for other state entities and for the country s political leadership these considerations complicate but do not render impossible the task of drafting a central bank human rights policy their ability to conduct detailed human rights impact assessments will be complicated by the relative speed and discretion with which they must often operate this does not however make it impossible for them to assess their impact on human rights instead it suggests that central banks need to develop and maintain a sufficiently detailed general and ongoing understanding of the actual impact of their operations on human rights this is so that they can make informed judgements about the likely effects of their proposed monetary decisions on specific communities this disaggregated approach should provide central banks with a detailed and nuanced understanding of how their policies actually affect different sub groups of their society by doing this it should enable central banks to determine the true costs and benefits of their policies and actions this should improve their decision making conclusion this analysis demonstrates three key points first it is becoming untenable for central banks to avoid incorporating their human rights impacts into their decision making and operations second a human rights approach offers central banks a new tool for understanding the true costs and benefits of their operations third central banks can meet their human rights responsibilities without compromising the independence they need to meet their monetary and financial responsibilities author danny bradlow

are the democratic presidential candidates proposals to make college tuition free a good idea two leading progressive contenders for the 2020 democratic nomination sens elizabeth warren and democratic socialist bernie sanders have generated headlines and enthusiastic applause at college rallies by demanding that public college be free to all and that most or all student debt be forgiven there are a number of grounds for shying away from the warren sanders proposals that nobody has mentioned yet to be sure college tuition has been rising at nearly four times the rate of general inflation faster even than medical care this rising sticker charge and a decline in need based discounts have caused ballooning debt in the hands of graduates and those who attended but did not graduate forty five million people owe a total of 1 6 trillion the default rates are low by comparison to other borrowing but the number of student loan borrowers in default still expands by 1 400 a day indiana has hardly been immune as the average yearly tuition at public universities has grown from about 1 800 to a little under 8 000 over the last 30 years still our state has worked harder than most to make higher education available our tuition raises have been the fourth lowest in the country for four year schools and 20th lowest for the two year institutions the nation as a whole spends more on higher education than any developed country except luxembourg about 30 000 per person according to the organization for economic co operation and development increasing government grants or subsidized borrowing does make it easier for the institutions to raise their price in the marketplace a recent examination by the federal reserve bank of new york concluded that when congress raises the amount a student can receive in pell grants the colleges raise tuition and reduce institutional aid to capture increases in pell grants all of this hardly means that we should embrace the status quo mayor pete buttigieg is right to urge that we make college dramatically more affordable he is also right to argue americans who have a college degree earn more than americans who don t as a progressive i have a hard time getting my head around the idea of a majority who earn less because they didn t go to college subsidizing a minority who earn more because they did paying for the all inclusive sanders plan would extract dollars out of our 401 k plans pension funds and other investment accounts the warren plan would levy a property tax on ultra millionaires but even its scholarly supporters seem a little unsure about its constitutionality even if it is constitutional there s a reason college faculty might want to give free public college a second thought if all tuition is free how will it be decided what tuition rates should exist at colleges could state universities raise tuition at their regional campuses to the rates charged at the flagship or would tuition at the headquarters location be lowered to the rate at regionals if not why not it seems inevitable that decisions about budgets and salaries now made by faculties administrators and trustees would have to be made instead by congress or some arm of government acting in its name finally and far more seriously what future could private colleges and universities have in such an environment while harvard and stanford and a few score endowed national names could likely survive universal free public college thousands of private colleges large and small would be disrupted beyond all measure america is better because we have long supported expanding post secondary education it will be a better 2020 discussion when we get beyond applause lines and into a discussion about how to move yet further ahead __________ shepard formerly indiana chief justice now serves as senior judge and teaches law send comments to ibjedit ibj com click here for more forefront columns

businesses should conduct adequate human rights due diligence before and during their decision making and implementation process this requirement means that they should conduct human rights impact assessments of their proposed operations they should also take steps to avoid or mitigate the identified adverse human rights impacts central banks will face particular challenges in meeting their human rights responsibilities their instrument independence means that their human rights policy will need to be respectful of the central bank s independence and its mandate at the same time the central bank needs to be cognisant of the fact that its human rights policy may have implications for other state entities and for the country s political leadership these considerations complicate but do not render impossible the task of drafting a central bank human rights policy their ability to conduct detailed human rights impact assessments will be complicated by the relative speed and discretion with which they must often operate this does not however make it impossible for them to assess their impact on human rights instead it suggests that central banks need to develop and maintain a sufficiently detailed general and ongoing understanding of the actual impact of their operations on human rights this is so that they can make informed judgements about the likely effects of their proposed monetary decisions on specific communities this disaggregated approach should provide central banks with a detailed and nuanced understanding of how their policies actually affect different sub groups of their society by doing this it should enable central banks to determine the true costs and benefits of their policies and actions this should improve their decision making conclusion this analysis demonstrates three key points first it is becoming untenable for central banks to avoid incorporating their human rights impacts into their decision making and operations second a human rights approach offers central banks a new tool for understanding the true costs and benefits of their operations third central banks can meet their human rights responsibilities without compromising the independence they need to meet their monetary and financial responsibilities

the reko diq project site courtesy tethyan copper company pakistan the land of black sand once expected a gold rush its residents were happy to help anyone willing to put in money required to dig up the precious metal from under their feet close to quarter of a century later however they are still waiting the gold diggers did come a first batch that arrived in april 1992 started setting up its base camp next to a craggy grey peak the shape of a pyramid rising humbly above the desert around it the locals call it koh e daleel the mountain of evidence the terrain was inhospitable no roads no vegetation no water nowhere to stay on a hot early summer day they hammered steel pegs into the rocks and tied nylon ropes to them to build tents for themselves they could not half finish their work when the wind arrived no ordinary gust it was as hot as a flame and sharp as an arrow its local name is gorich but the locals also call it the wind from hell it uprooted the pegs and snapped the ropes whatever tent structures had gone up gorich brought them crashing down the gold diggers among them many foreigners rushed to safety rubbing and washing the sand from their eyes almost all of them immediately wanted to return to quetta but that was not possible they needed a place where they could spend the night before they could plan their next move in 1993 siah rek and its nearby village humai got another name reko diq gold and copper mining project a wise old man sakhi jamal deen muhammadzai lived in a hamlet siah rek named as a tribute to the charcoal coloured sand surrounding it and situated not far from koh e daleel he had for decades seen the prowess of gorich as it blew from north to south and knew well the havoc it could wreak that afternoon he knew something else there were outsiders caught in the wind a survey team working for bhp minerals an american firm muhammadzai immediately went to them finding them standing haplessly amid the tattered remains of their tents he made them a voluntary offer they never expected the outsiders could use houses in the village not just for a night but for as long as they did not shift into their container houses expected from quetta over the next few days the villagers would shift to gidaans baloch tents made from goat and sheep skin designed to ward off gorich stranded some 50 kilometres to the southwest of the nearest town nok kundi the bhp team had no option but to accept the offer marking distance and places in a desert is like drawing lines on sand maps including the ones on google do not for instance show where the small village of rutti is located within chagai district how far away from quetta and in which direction the dwellers of the desert recognise it through their tried and tested markers water and vegetation rutti is a midpoint in the vast triangle that is chagai district wedged between quetta to the northeast taftan on the pak iran border to the southwest and hamun e mashkel lake to the southeast to the east of the village is an area that has both water and vegetation and to its west is an immense nothingness tiny hamlets separated by enormous stretches of desert siah rek being one of them inside a baloch house malika abbas white star in 1993 siah rek and its nearby village humai got another name the reko diq gold and copper mining project in the balochi language the name evokes infinite riches sand rek and mounds diq of gold on the evening of july 29 that year the governor house in quetta was humming with an air of urgency unusual for this stately mansion where nothing moves except at the speed of a snail masquerading as a bureaucrat the signing of the chagai hills exploration joint venture agreement chejva was just about to take place between the balochistan development authority bda and bhp minerals incorporated in delaware united states the draft agreement stated that bhp and bda would form a joint venture for prospecting and exploring gold and copper in reko diq the joint venture was to apply for up to ten prospecting licences covering an area of up to fifty square kilometres in the aggregate with the provision that it could relinquish the whole or part of this area and apply for licences over other areas in another major provision of the agreement bhp and bda were to make a respective contribution of 75 per cent and 25 per cent to the money required for the project they would share the revenues also by the same proportion since the provincial government did not have any money available for investment bhp agreed to lend it the funds it required on the condition that bhp will get the money back once the project starts producing mineral and metals with a compound interest charged at london inter bank offered rates libor plus two per cent added to the principal sum on paper the agreement did not look as bad as it later turned out to be except that there was no provision in the provincial laws to create such a joint venture or for the grant of a prospecting licence to a foreign firm not registered in pakistan bda also had no legal powers to enter into a joint venture as a party on its own on july 13 1993 ata muhammad jafar the bda chairman at the time arrived at the provincial secretariat in quetta he wanted the chief secretary to sign a file immediately chairman bda was hand carrying the file the then additional chief secretary balochistan later recorded in an official letter the file contained the draft agreement for the creation of the joint venture the additional chief secretary did not let the file bypass official procedures and observed that the draft required among other things to be vetted by the provincial finance law and planning departments he also pointed out that the date already fixed for signing the agreement july 29 did not in any case leave enough time to carry out the vetting before the two sides put their signatures to it few people in the government really know what gob is getting into in the agreement agreed that bhp is a good party mineral exploration in the area is highly desirable but gob has to be mindful of its interest specially the possible reaction of the people of the area to a large tract of land being reserved for bhp the additional chief secretary wrote the landscape in chagai abdul razique university of british columbia giving a conditional permission to jafar to go ahead with the agreement signing the officer noted chairman bda may be authorised to go ahead subject to the clause that the agreement will be of a provisional nature and any reasonable additions alterations proposed by planning development and finance departments in a period of one month from signing of the agreement shall be incorporated therein the two departments never had the chance to offer their input let alone see the additions and alterations proposed by them in the agreement how jafar and bda managed to change the provisional nature of the agreement remains anyone s guess time seems to have been his best friend brigadier retd abdul rahim durrani had assumed the post of acting governor of the province on july 19 1993 just 10 days before chejva was signed as had mohammad naseer mengal the acting chief minister the provincial assembly did not exist at the time and a caretaker provincial cabinet had taken charge only days earlier but someone somewhere knew the agreement suffered from multiple lacunae martin harris legal advisor to bhp wrote a letter to jafar on september 16 1993 pointing out we have discovered a number of oversights in the he later suggested that the provincial government relax a number of provisions of the balochistan mineral concession rules 1970 bmr 1970 subsequently on january 20 1994 ten days before the agreement became effective the provincial government relaxed 13 provisions of the rules including those governing the extent of the area available for prospecting licences exclusive rights over prospecting and exploration in the areas covered by the licences the right to prospect and explore minerals other than those mentioned in the licences the government s right to acquire merge and or take over the project and enforce royalty penalties and compensation supreme court of pakistan these changes had multiple effects the joint venture could apply for prospecting licences for an area spread over 50 square kilometres as opposed to just 10 kilometres as given in the original rules within the area covered by the licences the joint venture would have absolute monopoly and could prospect for and explore any minerals therein not just gold and copper the government lost many of its rights as provided for in the original rules to change the ownership of the joint venture and impose penalties and demand compensation in case official rules regulations and terms and conditions of the agreement were violated the company was indeed stretching the limits of its operations and the provincial government seemed to be readily obliging ahmer bilal soofi representing the balochistan government during the hearing of constitutional petitions challenging the agreement in the supreme court revealed that the joint venture managed to get 10 prospecting licences on december 8 1996 covering an area of 1000 square kilometres two years earlier the provincial department of industries commerce and mineral resources had provided the company a massive concession that it did not even ask for a waiver from paying 3 347 million rupees as annual fee for gold exploration in an area of 33 47 226 acres for a period of three years in a letter dated august 11 1994 bda the joint venture partner of bhp had written to the department to give the company only an extension in deadline to deposit the fee the new rules gave tcc unparalleled jurisdiction over the area it was prospecting and exploring in 2000 under another caretaker administration headed by justice retd amirul mulk mengal as the governor bhp demanded more changes in the agreement and got them the objective of those changes was two fold to rectify some of the legal anomalies and inconsistencies that existed in chejva in spite of relaxation in the application of brm 1970 and opening the way for the company to eventually apply for and get a mining licence in the area where it was prospecting and exploring the first change was affected through an addendum to the original agreement authorised by amirul mulk mengal in an undated letter there are serious question marks on the manner in which the then governor of balochistan granted authorisation the supreme court would later point out the signatories were changed from bhp and bda to bhp and balochistan government through its agent bda and the company also obtained the right to enter into partnerships and alliances with other parties the latter change set the ball rolling for bhp to involve mincor resources an australian mining firm to create tethyan copper company tcc in april 2000 in the meantime antofagasta a chile based firm incorporated in england and barrick gold of canada formed a company atacama owned equally by the two firms and registered in the united kingdom atacama eventually bought 100 per cent shares of tcc in 2006 through the australian stock exchange tcc first started its operations in pakistan as a foreign firm registered in australia but running a local office here in 2006 the government of balochistan and bhp agreed to novate chejva so as to substitute tcc with bhp as a party to that agreement subsequently tcc registered its pakistani subsidiary tethyan copper company pakistan tccp which practically took over all the prospecting and exploration activities and other work being done under the joint venture by that time the company or the companies as the case may be had sought and received multiple extensions in prospecting licences in violation of a chejva provision which said that each licence would be valid for an initial period of two years and would be extended just once for another three years provided that work on a feasibility study had started in the area covered by it malika abbas white star to overcome various legal hurdles created by changes in the name and ownership of foreign partner in chejva tcc started lobbying for a new set of mining rules replacing bmr 1970 says a retired official of the balochistan law department requesting anonymity the balochistan government wasted little time in coming up with balochistan mineral concession rules 2000 bmr 2000 the manner in which these laws were prepared was an extreme case of conflict of interest and a blatant instance of a government going out of its way to facilitate a private business during the hearing of constitutional petitions at the supreme court regarding the reko diq project senior lawyer raza kazim argued in january 2011 that the new rules were framed under the influence of bhp tcc soofi the counsel for the balochistan government revealed the new rules were prepared by the same law firm riaalaw that had also represented bhp s successor tcc at the balochistan high court during the hearing of a 2006 writ petition when under court orders the law firm s website was searched tcc was found to be one of its clients the website also showed that riaalaw had provided assistance to the balochistan government in the preparation of bmr 2000 this latter information was removed from the website in 2012 the new rules gave tcc unparalleled jurisdiction over the area it was prospecting and exploring no other mineral company operating anywhere in pakistan has ever enjoyed such perks and privileges it had its exploration licences renewed till 2009 even when it had not submitted the mandatory reports for the feasibility of mining operations in the area it also acquired a newly introduced mineral deposit retention licence which entitled it to exercise exclusive rights over any mineral or group of minerals it discovered until the government made a final decision on accepting or rejecting its application for a mining licence the company could amend increase or decrease the area it had been allotted under its exploration licences and most importantly it received the right to remove from the exploration area any mineral or group of minerals and sell or dispose off those minerals or any other materials excavated during exploration operations after the new mining rules came into force in 2002 and tcc took over from bhp it relinquished all its prospecting licences except one el 5 covering a huge area of 13 000 square kilometres granted under a specially devised bmr 2000 provision sources in quetta say the company s decision to drop the other licences was based on the information collected through the scanning of the area over a period of more than 14 years the company knew exactly where the gold and copper deposits were and in what quantity the sources add sometime in 2007 tcc prepared a draft agreement for starting mining operations in the reko diq area and started a vigorous lobbying campaign to have that agreement signed said ahmed bukhsh lehri in a 2012 interview with the herald he was then working as chief secretary balochistan the draft agreement a copy of which is in this magazine s possession offered only two per cent royalty to the provincial government the internationally recognised ratio for royalty payment in mineral operations is six per cent and it also provided that the company would set up none of the secondary and tertiary processing facilities it was required to under bmr 2000 nawab aslam raisani who became chief minister balochistan in early 2008 was alarmed by tcc s lobbying in favour of this flawed mining agreement soon after he came into government he started holding meetings over the reko diq project and after one such meeting on december 24 2009 he unilaterally revoked chejva tanjeel is a small mining reserve and looks even smaller when compared to the huge area covered by the reko diq project only three kilometres away from where tcc proposed to dig its own mines tanjeel has an economic value of 10 billion us dollars and a mine life of 18 20 years miri mud volcano in chagai mobeen mazhar going through a pre feasibility study that tcc had prepared and submitted in july 2010 about mining operations over an area of six square kilometres hidden within the thousands of square kilometres of land covered by el 5 the government of balochistan found something helpful tanjeel was not mentioned in the pre feasibility study in spite of the site s proven gold and copper deposits also around the same time raisani turned down a tcc application for a mining licence the provincial authorities thus decided to launch mining operations in tanjeel under the supervision of nuclear scientist dr samar mubarakmand with three main objectives firstly to prove to the international arbitration forums where tcc filed a case in 2010 that an early start of gold and copper mining was crucial to pakistan s economy it could save at least 820 million us dollars every year for the country s cash strapped economy in substituting copper imports and therefore the government could not wait for the outcome of what could be a lengthy legal battle between tcc and the pakistani authorities secondly to test if the government could carry out mining and mineral purification operations on its own and thirdly to find a new venue for engaging the indigenous human resources trained and employed at soon to be closed gold and copper mine at saindak also in chagai the executive committee of the national economic council ecnec took up the project proposal for discussion in 2010 on the request of balochistan government and approved it as a fast track scheme in that very year the provincial administration allocated 8 8 billion rupees for starting the mining at tanjeel the project was to get 4 4 billion rupees every year until metal production at its mine started thus was born balochistan copper and gold project less than five years later the provincial government decided to shut it down a february 10 2015 meeting of balochistan cabinet concluded that continuing the project was not economically feasible since it was not making quick progress as was originally intended saeed ahmed jamali secretary of mines and minerals department in balochistan says the project closure was long in the making nobody knew at the planning stage the volume of revenues and quantity of metals and minerals it was to yield he claims these things would become known only after drilling for mining operations had taken place a stage for which the government could not invest money he adds an official of the balochistan s mines and mineral directorate argues that designers of the project also did not take into account the delays that official procurement procedures cause they never realised how long it takes under official processes to procure equipment he says it was therefore an ill conceived venture and the government s time frame to start metal production from it was unrealistic he remarks supporters of the project point out that money not delays in machinery procurement were to be blamed for tanjeel s slower than envisioned progress going by the original allocations they say the project should have so far received 26 4 billion rupees in reality it has spent much less just a little above one billion rupees men in a market in balochistan malika abbas white star some of the big money was only allocated on paper during the 2011 12 financial year for instance the provincial government released 55 34 million rupees but the project authorities could spend 47 81 million rupees with the unspent money going back to the provincial exchequer in the following year 2012 13 the allocation was as high as 1 465 billion rupees but the money actually spent was a miniscule 210 million rupees the penultimate year when the provincial government made financial allocations for the project 2013 14 it received 1 252 billion rupees the money that could be spent was not even half of that 571 million rupees in the budget for the outgoing financial year 2014 15 mining at tanjeel was allocated 90 4 million rupees but it is not yet known how much of it has finally come back unspent to the provincial government reko diq contains one of the world s largest copper gold deposits with estimated mineral resources of at least 54 billion pounds of copper and 41 million ounces of gold the proponents of the project also point to the progress that it has made in its four year life a number of administrative and residential facilities were completed at the project site technical processes such as geological and partial structural mapping of the reserves were completed and contour mapping was done over 24 square kilometres of mining and processing area three holes for metallurgical tests and geotechnical studies and 20 confirmatory holes were drilled contract for the chemical analysis of 5000 ore samples was signed analysis has already been done on two batches of 40 and 24 samples bidding documents for the purchase of a sulphuric acid plant were prepared and basic conceptual design and basic equipment design of solvent extraction and electro winning plants were completed 11 pieces of equipments were purchased and received at project site this is some progress they say especially when compared to what ttc and its predecessor bhp could achieve after having worked in reko diq for well over decade and a half in any case the project s advocates argue its continued operations would have helped balochistan s and by extension pakistan s stance at the international arbitration forums this would have shown the international tribunals that a foreign company was creating unnecessary hurdles in the way of mining operations crucial to local development as well as the provincial and national economies sources in quetta say both the civilian provincial administration and an army affiliated entity called army s special projects are busy scrutinising balochistan copper and gold project for any misuse of funds and power in its execution indeed during a conversation at an upscale restaurant in quetta a former employee of the now defunct project rushes to the provincial secretariat leaving his lunch half finished someone has informed him that the provincial government is planning to proceed under anti corruption laws against the project officials who had done the process of reserving land for it he was worried that his name could be in the list of those officials balochistan chief minister dr abdul malik baloch decided to visit england this march along with some members of his cabinet and a legal team representing his provincial government in international arbitration tribunals one purpose of the visit was to hold talks with the representatives of tcc for an out of court settlement rumours were rife at the time that the balochistan government was in fact interested in signing a new contract with tcc at terms and conditions different from those of chejva one of the main provisions in the new agreement would be to enhance the share of the balochistan government in royalties and profits but malik surprised even the members of his own national party np when he refused to disclose the proposed contents of the negotiations with tcc it was only after his return from england that the chief minister held a meeting with his cabinet on may 4 2015 and told his ministers that on the advice of his legal team he has decided to hire foreign experts to invite fresh bids for auctioning blocks of copper and gold deposits at reko diq one cabinet member later remarked the wheel is going to be reinvented after 25 years there were question marks over the timing of the decision too after all both the international chamber of commerce icc and the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid had in february 2013 rejected a tcc plea that the balochistan government be stopped from carrying out any mining activities in reko diq area why the critics ask did it take the government more than two years to invite the new auction bids koh e daleel in reko diq courtesy tethyan copper company pakistan soofi who is heading the legal team representing the balochistan government at icc and icsid says the decision took time because of the legal complications involved he explains in an interview at his lahore office that the first part of his team s strategy involved getting rid of the embargo tcc was seeking from the international tribunals on any mineral operations in the reko diq project area pending decisions on its applications for the resumption of chejva and the payment of compensation said it had claims over the entire 14 deposits found in a 99 square kilometre area moved applications in which it insisted that neither the government of balochistan nor any other third party could work on these deposits he says if those applications had been accepted it would have taken years before any mining work could start in the area he explains once those applications were rejected the assets became unlocked one of the main reasons why tcc could not get the ban it was seeking was the limited area of just six square kilometres that its feasibility study covered the study was submitted to the government in 2011 years behind schedule islamic republic of afghanistan ministry of mines islamic republic of afghanistan ministry of mines soofi says the provincial government needed time and information to consider various options after the reko diq project area had become available for further exploration and mining activities obviously governments take a lot of time in their decision making he says especially because there are different levels of government involved the provincial and the federal there is also a coalition government and that is also why the issue has been dragging on for a while soofi also narrates how in an unprecedented development he first briefed the balochistan assembly and then the balochistan cabinet about the proceedings at the international tribunals in early may this year it was very unusual never before has a lawyer gone to a provincial assembly and briefed it about a case his partners in london however saw it as the most interesting development in terms of being transparent to the people s representatives who actually own the project i explained to them i gave them estimates i gave them a tentative assessment of the nature of awards that normally come about in international arbitration the nature of expenses that we would incur and legal issues that we would face soofi says giving details of the briefing he provided to the provincial legislature meanwhile the cases for the resumption of chejva and the payment of compensation are still continuing at the international tribunals soofi says it will take a few years before a final decision is made he explains how by first challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunals and their composition and then by arguing in favour of separating the liability phase from the quantum phase his legal team has already warded off the possibility of an early verdict the tribunal will decide whether in its view the government of balochistan is liable to resume the agreement and pay the compensation once the tribunal declares that the government is liable then another process which is called the quantum phase will start in which the tribunal will decide the amount of compensation to be paid this may take years and yet the government may have to pay at least some compensation to tcc even if the two tribunals do not issue verdicts that favour the company a senior member of the provincial government s legal team without wanting to be named explains that the payment of compensation is not linked to the merits of the case consider for instance that the international tribunals decide that chejva is illegal the company can still argue that it needs to be compensated for the money it has spent on the project he says you are supposed to pay back the expenses that the company has incurred section 65 of the contract act provides for that even when an agreement is struck down soofi therefore has suggested to the governments both provincial and federal that reaching an out of court settlement with tcc could be a suitable option my team did give a presentation to the government of balochistan and the federal government at the time we proposed that this was an appropriate time to reconsider a settlement we suggested this in writing as well soofi says we should either sit with tcc or talk to third parties who could potentially buy out tcc s claims the senior member of the legal team thus explains the rationale for an out of court settlement they say they have incurred some expenses we say they are not reporting the expenses right there has to be discussion to sort it out chief minister malik too favours what he calls a business deal with the company rejecting the opposition s allegations that he has received commission in lieu of a promise to give the project back to tcc he is reported to have said earlier this year whatever decision or deal reached will be presented before the balochistan cabinet and assembly for approval these explanations do not assuage the apprehensions of raza kazim a lahore based lawyer in april 2015 he filed a petition at the supreme court seeking to restrain the federal and balochistan governments from pursuing an out of court settlement with tcc he insists the government is not revealing a number of important facts and is not sharing relevant papers and records with the public any out of court settlement arrived at without the public knowledge of those facts and documents will be anathema to public interest he argues some petitioners approached the court with petitions for the termination of the agreement deeming it against the interests of the pakistani state and people his application indeed brings to light some little known but extremely important facts about the reko diq project quoting from tcc s application at icsid kazim states that the mineral deposits in the area are much bigger than is already known and they are not difficult to explore given their physical and geological conditions in the last 20 years only one other viable world class greenfield copper deposit has been found the hugh dummett deposit at oyu tolgoi in mongolia in 2001 since then despite billions of dollars spent on exploration the world s mining companies have found no copper deposits greater than or even equal to reko diq he cites from tcc s claim to substantiate his argument about the size of the deposits reko diq contains one of the world s largest copper gold deposits with estimated mineral resources of at least 54 billion pounds of copper and 41 million ounces of gold in fact reko diq is one of the only three known pre production deposits in the world with more than 44 billion pounds of copper and more than 40 million ounces of gold the tcc claim further reads reko diq s are largely exposed but not deeply eroded as a result the mineral deposits at the site have not been worn away over time yet are close enough to the surface that the costs of extracting the ore will be significantly lower than in comparable projects kazim cites he enormous size and favourable geological characteristics of its copper and gold deposits the relatively low technical risk of the anticipated mining project when compared to the challenges faced at other large deposits and its high commercial value in the fact of very low likelihood of a comparable deposit being discovered or becoming available for purchase reveals the claim further leading kazim to demand the court that it make the government award the contract for the project only after it complies with extractive industry transparency initiative eiti this initiative is a coalition of national governments companies civil society groups investors and international organisations committed to promoting transparency for responsible management of natural resources and for realising the potential for growth and economic development that those resources can provide the supreme court has not yet fixed a date for taking up kazim s petition litigation over reko diq started in 2006 in a constitution petition filed that year maulana abdul haq baloch and others approached the balochistan high court praying for a termination of chejva the high court dismissed the plea on june 26 2007 the petitioners then challenged the verdict at the supreme court in 2009 and 2011 some other petitioners approached the same court with similar petitions for the termination of the agreement deeming it against the interests of the state and people the proceedings in the case continued throughout 2011 and 2012 an aerial view of kambaran peak in chagai district mobeen mazhar at one stage during the hearings kazim presented before the court a draft of the qara zaghan gold project qzgp to be signed between a private company afghan krystal natural resources company and the government of afghanistan his objective was to show how chejva in comparison with the proposed agreement in afghanistan was a flawed document that heavily favoured bhp tcc without safeguarding the interests of the people of balochistan the official summary of the draft of the afghan agreement eventually signed on january 10 2011 states that the process for awarding the contract started in the middle of 2008 and by early 2010 the government selected afghan krystal natural resources company for signing the agreement from among the three companies that had submitted bids for the project the selection criteria was simple the selected company offered to invest the highest amount of money in the project 50 million us dollars promised the highest annual production 1 628 tons and committed to paying the highest royalty to the government 26 per cent a successful bid for involvement in the reko diq project either for a part or the whole of it may help mcc get out of a mining project in afghanistan where it no longer seems interested in operating the draft agreement provided that all equipment and machinery required will be provided by afghan krystal natural resources company will strictly comply with all the environmental safeguards in line with the laws of the country the other provisions required the company to create 280 job opportunities and offer social services to the people of the region such as building schools and clinics most importantly an official afghan document notes in line with the principles of eiti the government has decided to publish the summary of the contract in all national newspapers and also publish the details of the contract on the website of the government referring to kazim s presentation the supreme court compared the two agreements the one for qzgp and the other for reko diq and concluded that the latter was entered into for an inadequate consideration as regards the percentage interests of the provincial government and that many of the developments therein such as the authorisation for the inclusion of an addendum in 2010 were of suspect nature the court also conducted detailed hearings on a number of other questions raised about reko diq including the ones about the legality of changes made in the agreement itself through the addendum as well as with the novation agreement and those brought about through mining rules and regulations first by relaxing bmr 1970 and later by promulgating bmr 2000 on january 7 2013 a three member bench of the apex court headed by the then chief justice iftikhar muhammad chaudhry declared chejva illegal void and non binding because it violated the mineral development act 1948 the mining concession rules 1970 and the contract act 1872 among other laws in its detailed 150 page verdict the court declared that changes in the parties to the agreement from bda to the balochistan government and from bhp to tcc were also held to be illegal and void a dirt track moving south west and covering some 50 kilometre stretch of dasht e goran or the goran desert links reko diq project area with another copper and gold mining project in saindak another 40 kilometre long road with metalled top connects saindak with taftan located on the thin end of a triangular territorial wedge that district chagai is wikipedia in 1995 the government launched a gold and copper mining project at saindak but closed it down after a trial run of a few months due to a lack of funds and falling prices of copper gold and silver in the international market the project was restarted in 2001 after the federal government awarded a mining contract to a state owned chinese firm metallurgical corporation of china mcc the contract was initially valid for 10 years but later it was extended for another five years it gives balochistan only two per cent royalty the federal government owns 48 per cent stake in it while mcc has 50 per cent share in its ownership and profits set to end next year the mining contract has not brought any change in the lives of the people of pakistan s largest and one of the most impoverished districts says noor ali sanjarani general secretary of a network of non government organisations in chagai yet there are reports that the same company that runs saindak may soon bid for and receive official approval for carrying out mining operations in reko diq the chinese company in fact has been interested in reko diq since the 1990s even when tcc was conducting its prospecting and exploration work there mcc approached the provincial and federal governments with a proposal to develop the reko diq project in january 2009 mcc along with tcc was invited to a meeting of the joint steering committee of the federal and provincial governments which oversees the project the two companies presented their respective financial and technical proposals even though tcc protested that mcc had no legal right to offer proposals for a project in which tcc had already invested more than 200 million us dollars on january 23 2009 the steering committee rejected mcc s proposal speculation about a possible role for the chinese firm in the future development of the reko diq project did not end though timothy livesey chief executive officer of tcc deposed at icsid in november 2012 that a local employee of his company had seen a convoy of vehicles travelling to the reko diq site led by an employee of balochistan copper and gold project some of the vehicles in the convoy and their drivers had been supplied by the nearby mining project saindak operated by mcc he said a successful bid for involvement in the reko diq project either for a part or the whole of it may help mcc get out of a mining project in afghanistan where it no longer seems interested in operating in early 2013 news reports appeared about a conflict between the afghan government and mcc over mes aynak copper mining project in logar province southeast of kabul these reports suggested that mcc no longer wanted to abide by the terms and conditions of the three billion us dollar contract it had signed in 2007 for mining at mes aynak the company wants to renege on its commitment to build a railway line power plant and processing factory as provided for in the contract newspapers quoted business sources as saying tcc s pakistani employees had informed intelligence agencies that the company was hiding crucial information about the discovery of some strategic mineral resources in an area falling under one of its ten exploration licences the chinese firm expects to get a better deal in pakistan many in balochistan citing security reasons see an official tilt in favour of mcc owned by a friendly and ever cooperative neighbour which is investing heavily in various parts of the country including balochistan roshan baloch s voice sometimes drowns in the noise of an electricity generator he is using to light his house in dalbandin town he has worked with tcc for three years and is the district president of chagai for the np that leads a coalition government in balochistan he does not believe in any of the reasons cited by the provincial government for not awarding the reko diq project to tcc as far as he understands there are only two reasons for that the security establishment s suspicion that tcc is linked to baloch separatists and the chinese interest in the project he claims that activities of baloch separatists were at their peak when tcc started its field survey to identify potential routes for a 682 kilometre long pipeline it wanted to build to transport copper concentrate in the form of slurry to gwadar port even while working in districts such as kharan considered a stronghold of baloch liberation army and panjgur and turbat considered bastions of balochistan liberation front tcc teams including foreigners freely moved around without attracting any negative attention he says this made the pakistani establishment believe that baloch separatists have cordial relations with tcc gidaans in chagai desert a security official in quetta lends credence to roshan s analysis he claims that federal security agencies working in the province are convinced that baloch separatist groups have the financial backing of some foreign mining firms operating in the province then there is the element of real or perceived deception in december 2009 when the raisani government terminated chejva there were rumours that one of tcc s pakistani employees had informed intelligence agencies that the company was hiding crucial information about the discovery of some strategic mineral resources in an area falling under one of its ten exploration licences chagai spread over 44 748 square kilometres of sand dunes is pakistan s largest district area wise besides being the site of the country s 1998 nuclear tests it is known for its massive mineral resources geologists so far have identified the presence of 23 minerals here variously called by opinion writers as a local el dorado and key to the country s economic future it is mostly a pakistani version of the australian outback arid sparsely populated impoverished and underdeveloped roads are difficult to find here as anyone travelling from nok kundi to reko diq will find after the first 25 kilometres even the dirt track

when my father offered to help bhp he only hoped that the company would bring employment and some basic amenities for his people he says those hopes have not materialised and the putative owners of what is known to be one of the world s largest deposits of gold and copper remain as resource poor as they always have been rearing goats and sheep was and still is the sole source of income here he

many central banks are rethinking their approach to the environmental and social impact of their operations this is because their decisions can affect access to housing healthcare education work to adequate food and water and the security of their pensions at the one planet summit in paris two years ago a network of central banks and supervisors was set up with the main focus on climate change now with 40 members from five continents the network is drawn to pay more attention to other environmental and social considerations the precise mandates of central banks vary but one thing they all have in common is responsibility for maintaining price stability their primary policy tools for achieving this objective are interest rates the capital and reserve requirements for banks and trading debt instruments in financial markets central banks also act as a lender of last resort to the banking system or more generally to the financial sector they regulate and supervise the activities of banks and other financial institutions they manage the country s payment system maintain financial stability and manage the country s foreign exchange reserves in some countries the central bank can be given additional responsibilities such as promoting development finance or financial inclusion to fully understand the risk that climate poses to price and financial stability central banks need to consider how changing weather patterns will affect a number of variables these include food production migration patterns and people s access to food water housing and jobs and how these in turn influence aggregate demand credit allocation inflation and government deficits in other words as i explain in more detail in this article central bankers are being inexorably pushed to reconsider the relationship between central banking and human rights the connections the mandates powers and governance arrangements of all central banks are established by law they must comply with all the applicable law including the constitutional and international legal obligations of their home states in principle this means that central banks are bound by the international human rights commitments of their sovereigns historically central banks have been able to avoid dealing with human rights issues this is because the political leadership determines the price stability goal for the economy and then lets the central bank decide how to meet this inflation objective this arrangement suggests that the central bank s independence is limited to the technical issues relevant to achieving the goal set by the government in addition it assumes at least implicitly that the social and environmental implications of the country s monetary and financial goals are the government s responsibility however in reality central banking is not a purely technical function for example the social and environmental impact of its decision to change interest rates will vary depending on how it implements the decision if the central bank decides to change interest rates through open market operations the social and environmental impacts will depend on which instruments it chooses to trade and in what proportions on the other hand these affects will depend on the decisions of banks if it implements the decision by changing the reserve requirements or the interest rate it charges banks for short term loans there are some noteworthy examples the central banks of kenya the netherlands and the federal reserve bank of san francisco consider factors such as community development and financial inclusion in their stewardship of their financial systems and the dutch central bank now has a mandate to include sustainability in its decision making the chinese central bank has been authorised to take climate considerations into account in its monetary decisions central bank operations therefore cannot avoid affecting human rights the human rights responsibilities the unavoidable impact of central banking operations on human rights means that central banks have to develop a better understanding of their human rights responsibilities the applicable law is the starting point but the relevant law and jurisprudence is unlikely to provide detailed guidance on how central banks should interpret and implement their human rights responsibilities a good reference tool for the central bank is the un guiding principles on business and human rights these principles stipulate that all businesses should have a human rights policy the policy should be publicly available and should be applicable to all the business s operations and decision making the principles also state that businesses should conduct adequate human rights due diligence before and during their decision making and implementation process this requirement means that they should conduct human rights impact assessments of their proposed operations they should also take steps to avoid or mitigate the identified adverse human rights impacts central banks will face particular challenges in meeting their human rights responsibilities their instrument independence means that their human rights policy will need to be respectful of the central bank s independence and its mandate at the same time the central bank needs to be cognisant of the fact that its human rights policy may have implications for other state entities and for the country s political leadership these considerations complicate but do not render impossible the task of drafting a central bank human rights policy their ability to conduct detailed human rights impact assessments will be complicated by the relative speed and discretion with which they must often operate this does not however make it impossible for them to assess their impact on human rights instead it suggests that central banks need to develop and maintain a sufficiently detailed general and ongoing understanding of the actual impact of their operations on human rights this is so that they can make informed judgements about the likely effects of their proposed monetary decisions on specific communities this disaggregated approach should provide central banks with a detailed and nuanced understanding of how their policies actually affect different sub groups of their society by doing this it should enable central banks to determine the true costs and benefits of their policies and actions this should improve their decision making conclusion this analysis demonstrates three key points first it is becoming untenable for central banks to avoid incorporating their human rights impacts into their decision making and operations second a human rights approach offers central banks a new tool for understanding the true costs and benefits of their operations third central banks can meet their human rights responsibilities without compromising the independence they need to meet their monetary and financial responsibilities author danny bradlow

published monday 15 july 2019 print disqus no easy solutions a radical restructuring of the economy and tax code mp3 a brief commercial new york maine and montana this is the final letter of the six part series of my reply to ray dalio s essays here are some links to help you wrap it all together ray s original letter why and how capitalism needs to be reformed parts 1 and 2 his follow up it s time to look more carefully at monetary policy 3 mp3 and modern monetary theory mmt my responses part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5 a generous and gentlemanly reply from ray in forbes as ray notes the problems he describes really are existential he and i agree more than we disagree but our responses differ i think that we both agree that the wrong answers will cause much angst and pain for most of our fellow citizens and that is a severe understatement and given his reply to me in forbes i think ray would agree with me there are no easy solutions only very difficult choices vs disastrous ones the longer we wait to deal with the problems the more painful resolving them will be and make no mistake the existential problems we are talking about and neither of us use the word existential lightly will resolve themselves in a highly tumultuous manner if we as a society don t face them directly and soon they are mostly problems of our own making and since there are no time machines we must deal with the reality which we created today in my final reply to ray i sum up my previous letters and describe one possible path for dealing with these problems my idea will be controversial for most people i am totally open to another better solution if anybody knows one ray started his letter as an invitation to a dialogue conversation i hope we can continue our conversation and others will join in and with that let s finish my open letter to ray no easy solutions dear ray let me see if i can summarize my writing so far and what i believe to be your main concerns which i share i do welcome a response last week i focused primarily on the us deficit and debt situation total federal debt is now 22 5 trillion plus another 3 trillion of state and local debt annual deficits are running at an average of 1 2 trillion and growing as i demonstrated in a recession the annual deficits will likely rise to 2 5 trillion and certainly no less than 2 trillion simply using cbo projections and assuming that revenues would drop and then slowly recover similarly to the last recession i think that is a more than reasonable forecast that means total us government debt will be at 44 trillion plus maybe 6 trillion of state and local debt by the end of the 2020s just a decade from now not to mention unfunded liabilities corporate debt etc of course that assumes no tax increases and no budget cuts significant spending cuts are unlikely as the deficits are mostly entitlements interest and defense spending so called non defense discretionary spending is actually a small part of the total budget and while deficit hawks might find 100 billion to cut here and there that wouldn t affect the grand scheme of things there is little political will to cut entitlement spending and to your point ray we may actually need more spending in order to solve the growing wealth and income disparity problem that brings us to taxes most tax increase proposals would raise rates on the rich using government data i showed that a 25 increase on the top 10 of us income earners roughly those making 120 000 would produce only 250 billion per year ray i am not certain what you think it will cost to reduce income disparity but it would certainly eat up a good portion of that 250 billion leaving little for deficit reduction any such tax increase will be even more difficult if we enter recession within the next few years which the new york fed s forecast shows is not far fetched here is their latest data showing a roughly 33 probability of recession within 12 months source peter boockvar the longer the yield curve stays inverted and the more it inverts the more probable a recession is we have now had an inverted yield curve for three months and as i write are still in that situation the new york fed s model has never reached a probability of 100 prior to any recession but if memory serves there has always been a recession anywhere from nine to 18 months after the model reaches its current level the timing isn t precise but it s close enough for our discussion in any case at some point there will be a recession the fed s rate cut plans notwithstanding i think they will keep cutting at least back to the zero bound you indicate that you believe and i agree that it won t put the economy back on track then they will start with quantitative easing you also feel that qe won t help and will likely cause even greater income and wealth disparity i agree but i have sat in meetings with participants in the fed thought process confronted with the probability that their actions won t deliver the desired results they simply reply that we have to do something i m sure you ve had that experience more times than i no matter how ineffective we might believe it to be they are going to keep rates at or below the zero bound and ratchet up quantitative easing building the fed s balance sheet up to levels that today would seem mind numbing i think japan is the model here like the boj the fed will keep rates ultra low and buy bonds until there are no more bonds to buy the government will run massive deficits as long as the market lets them get away with it and in japan and apparently europe at least the market seems to have quite a deal of tolerance in that regard i call it japanification and it will have roughly the same results here extremely low growth if any growth at all tending towards deflation except that the deflation at least in the price of things government doesn t affect like healthcare will likely be worse in the 2020s because of technology that s not the end of the world but it is certainly not a world that compares favorably to the 1950s 1980s or 1990s you argue that we need to engage in a new combination of fiscal and monetary policy something you called monetary policy 3 or mp3 modern monetary theory mmt may or may not be part of that and you caution that mmt has significant negative consequences and that you are not endorsing it again i would totally agree i want to come back to mp3 a little later a radical restructuring of the economy and tax code you ve laid out what you believe to be the basis for how the economy and markets work let me offer a few simple assumptions of my own there is no political will in either the republican or democratic party to reduce entitlement spending and entitlement spending is on an ever increasing path there is simply no way that we can raise income taxes enough to close the deficit to within striking distance of nominal gdp growth where debt relative to gdp growth is equal as long as debt is expanding as it is now we will stay in a slow growth economy at best if not in recession much research shows that increasing debt beyond today s level will reduce gdp growth what we need to do is very difficult balance the budget bring deficits and debt under control so that we can begin to grow our way out of the crisis but we can t do that while thinking about revenues as we do now so what can we do the first step toward getting yourself out of a hole is to stop digging i would suggest that the us adopt a value added tax or vat excluding food and certain other basic necessary items i would make the vat high enough to completely eliminate social security taxes on both the individual and businesses giving lower income earners a significant tax break we could also compensate those below the poverty line for their vat costs ironically you and i will both qualify for social security benefits soon i daresay you need it even less than i do we aren t the only ones i think we should consider means testing social security and the same for all entitlements consumption taxes like the vat are the least economically damaging of all taxes at least according to most of the research that i have read while i personally or at least the economist in me would like a vat high enough to get rid of all other taxes i just don t know if it would be politically possible one attraction should be that if the vat is high enough say in the 17 or 18 range we could have much lower income taxes just for illustration maybe there could be no income tax below 50 000 a 10 income tax on incomes from 50 000 100 000 a 20 tax on all income between 100 000 and 1 million a 25 tax on incomes between 1 million and 10 million and a 30 tax on incomes over 10 million all with no personal deductions for anything period that should certainly produce enough total revenue along with corporate taxes to fund the government as currently configured it might even allow a little bit more for important needs we have deferred like infrastructure as well as medical and scientific research i totally understand that conservatives are uncomfortable opening the door to a vat when a future majority might raise income taxes on top of it i would be among them in the spirit of compromise we could amend the constitution to require 60 majorities in both house and senate to pass any tax increases of course that would have to be passed by 37 states in order to become part of the constitution but that can be part of the negotiation process perhaps the new tax regime s launch could be contingent on adoption by 37 states which would encourage a more rapid adoption process i would also suggest that the tax changes be phased in over three or four years to allow for individuals and businesses to adjust this plan would eliminate the need for higher debts and quantitative easing and would let the fed keep interest rates at a more normal level retirees could once again look for an actual return on their savings instead of the brutal punishment of financial repression we can have a whole separate conversation on allowing the market to set interest rates rather than 12 individuals sitting around a table mp3 i would welcome a further explanation of what you mean by monetary policy 3 i agree we need to do something far different than we are now if we continue down this same path at some point a more left wing government will come to power raise taxes and increase spending but not really deal with deficits or the burden of ever increasing entitlement spending that will not work as well as they hope i can totally foresee a movement back to the right which would want to repeal those same policies neither side would actually come close to dealing with the real problems we would remain in a regime of ever increasing deficits accompanied by growing debt and quantitative easing the simple fact of the matter we don t know how much debt the markets will be willing to give to the united states as in actually having the cash not to mention the willingness to buy government debt 44 trillion is a lot of money which is why i think we will be encumbered with quantitative easing and zero interest rates until there is a significant structural change in how we manage revenue and spending we simply don t want to know what the limit is on the amount of debt the united states can sustain if we ever find out it will be too late we will be in a crisis unfortunately i think my proposal or any other compromise solution is simply not possible in today s partisan world that being said i think this is an important conversation to have when that crisis does happen maybe somebody will pull one of the compromise plans off the shelf and say let s try this what i don t want to see is a repeat of what happened at the beginning of the great recession when the powers that be finally realized the financial world was collapsing down around our ears they had no plan they were making it up as they went along while they put out the fire they also did a great deal of damage this was not the best way to deal with the problem but it was probably the best they could do at that moment given the realities on the ground that s why it is important to make this discussion become both public and national i would hope that others will join us in thinking about how to restructure the us economy into a more self sustaining and hopefully more equitable system having plans available for consideration in the next crisis will help create a willingness to compromise i think this may be the most important decision that our nation makes in my lifetime if we continue down this path at best we are consigning ourselves to more of the same meager growth at worst we will have a crisis that ends with what i call the great reset where the world has to radically restructure its debt in ways that will not be pleasant that is an understatement along the lines of calling the great depression merely unpleasant all this will be happening as technology improves our lives but also slowly eliminates higher paying jobs causing many people to earn less than they thought their education would justify we will see more become underemployed creating a great deal of political and social frustration i hope we can avoid this type of blade runner outcome there is the potential for a far more abundant and pleasant future for everyone if we can reconcile these economic conundrums this has been a conversation well worth having ray i want to sincerely thank you for starting what could be a very very important national engagement and politely ask for a little bit more elucidation on what you mean by mp3 seriously i really want to know a brief commercial i know that many readers are small business owners especially investment advisor broker dealer firms one of the problems in the investment advisor business as well as others is that many of us are getting older and need to transition our businesses to younger successors who need financing one of the partners in my network of recommended services is a national bank called t bank which specializes in sba small business administration loans they have done numerous sba loans for small businesses that are transitioning to the next generation sba loans also have other purposes and t bank is an excellent source t bank also develops cash balance retirement plans that let owners save more tax deferred income i have a cash balance plan and it indeed works you can learn more by listening to a podcast or reading the transcript i did on the sba process by clicking here there is also a direct number at the end of the transcript podcast i hope you find it helpful note i receive a standard referral fee from t bank as part of my business income new york maine and montana early august sees me in new york for a few days before the annual economic fishing event camp kotok then maybe another day in new york before i meet shane in montana to spend a few days with darrell cain on flathead lake i met with my partners olivier garret and ed d agostino in boston two weeks ago we were making longer term plans for mauldin economics as we do from time to time they have done a very good job of growing the business and i am happy with it but they also expressed very clearly that i need to stop talking about writing a book about the future and actually begin writing i am mentally ready but structurally i am not always the most organized writing a book is simply a massive undertaking especially when it is as all encompassing as the future whatever that is but to underline their insistence they laid out a plan and offered help it made sense and i am now actually beginning to write the goal is to have a book in our hands sometime in the spring much of the writing has already been done in one form or another the problem is pulling it together not to mention sorting through the thousands of pages of research on my computer and in links that i have saved and much that has been sent to me by teams of my readers thank you the good news is my travel schedule is not all that demanding over the next five to six months and if puerto rico can avoid another debilitating hurricane this is a great place to write years ago i took my family to venice where a reader graciously offered to be our guide for a few days he took us out to one of the small islands nearby where ernest hemingway actually wrote some of his novels it was quite the idyllic location i can t complain in the least about my own location and circumstances so i simply need to get on with it and crank out a chapter or two a week for the next five months plus my regular letters as my dad would say when we started a big project son that s no hill for a stepper and with that it is time to hit the send button let me wish you a great week your getting ready to step up analyst john mauldin chairman mauldin economics p s

trump s first 100 days in office are almost up april 26 2017 sign up for our free video newsletter here racing to convey a sense of momentum to president trump s sluggish legislative agenda the white house unveiled a plan for what it called one of the biggest tax cuts in american history wednesday just ahead of the administration s symbolic first 100 days in office the one page outline touted as an overhaul of the tax code bears the hallmark of other early trump proposals a broad brush overview of bold goals that is intended to serve as an opening bid with congress rather than a fully baked policy proposal advertisement the plan was immediately met with skepticism from budget groups and faces a daunting future on capitol hill lawmakers from both parties are wary that the white house hasn t said how it would pay for the cuts which likely would provide the greatest benefits to higher income earners and corporations at its center is a large reduction in corporate tax rates to 15 from multinational corporations to mom and pop shops the current u s corporate tax rate is 35 the highest among developed economies but many companies pay a lower rate by using deductions in the tax code the plan also reduces the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three with rates of 10 25 and a top rate of 35 advertisement the outline released by the white house lacks many basic details including income requirements pegged to new tax brackets any explanation of a new tax break for childcare expenses or any analysis of how much it would increase the national debt among the deductions it would eliminate would be one for the payment of state and local taxes that would be a big hit to californians and residents of other states with high taxes and high earners the proposal also would eliminate the inheritance tax on multi million dollar estates and cut a 3 8 tax on investment income imposed as part of obamacare advertisement it would eliminate the alternative minimum tax a backstop intended to prevent the highest earners from using deductions and other strategies to avoid paying substantial taxes the alternative minimum tax increasingly forces upper middle class earners to pay more taxes because it doesn t adjust for inflation it also would impose an undefined one time tax on corporate profits held overseas in an attempt to bring the money back to u s operations in an attempt to simplify the plan would eliminate most deductions used by higher earners but would preserve those for charitable giving and home loans among the costliest and most popular it would also double the standard deduction which currently is 12 700 for a married couple filing jointly advertisement this tax reform package is about growing the economy creating jobs said gary cohn director of trump s national economic council who presented the plan at the white house briefing with treasury secretary steven t mnuchin the plan is sure to meet resistance and refinement on capitol hill among democrats who oppose heavy tax breaks for high earners and corporate interests republicans who worry about the deficit and lobbying interests concerned with the potential loss of favored deductions democrats and some outside groups also complained that the proposal would chiefly benefit wealthy americans like trump personally rather than middle class wage earners advertisement in response to a question mnuchin said trump had no intention of releasing his tax returns further slamming the door on a dispute that has persisted since the campaign when the billionaire businessman became the first major presidential candidate since the 1970s to refuse to let voters see how much he pays in taxes and details about his business deals and investments but trump and his advisors cast it as a historic and long overdue opportunity to rewrite tax laws that have grown increasingly complicated since the last major rewrite in 1986 under president reagan this isn t going to be easy doing big things never is cohn said we will be attacked from the left and we ll be attacked from the right but one thing is certain i would never ever bet against this president he will get this done for the american people advertisement if the plan does not pay for itself it would need support from at least some democrats under current senate rules some were quick to denounce it on wednesday sen ron wyden of oregon the top democrat on the finance committee called the proposal an unprincipled tax plan that will result in cuts for the 1 conflicts for the president crippling debt for america and crumbs for the working people republican leaders in the house have worked for years on their own plans which now include a smaller tax break for companies a drop to 20 for corporations and a maximum of 25 for pass through companies advertisement their plan also depends on a border adjustment tax to bring in 1 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years to help recover the cost of the lower rates that tax would subject importers including retailers to higher taxes and produce breaks for companies that export the proposal has split the business community mnuchin said the administration likes some aspects of the border tax but is not backing it now advertisement we will be working very closely with the house and the senate to turn this into a bill that can be passed and the president can sign he said of the administration proposal and there s lots and lots of details that will go into how that will pay for itself republican leaders on capitol hill issued a joint statement wednesday that fell short of an endorsement but said trump s outline will serve as critical guideposts for congress trump s advisors argued that the plan will pay for itself through economic growth but most economists dispute that analysis which could put trump at odds with long held republican promises to trim the deficit advertisement the nonpartisan tax policy center estimated that trump s campaign tax plan which includes eliminating the alternative minimum tax and other changes along with the tax cut to corporations proposed wednesday would reduce federal revenue by 7 2 trillion over the first decade marc short trump s director of legislative affairs was deliberately vague on that point during a meeting with reporters this week saying the administration did not intend to order an analysis of the plan s deficit impact at this stage he called paying for the tax cuts without borrowing money the goal but said the administration would weigh in later on whether it would support a plan that does not meet that goal advertisement instead the administration is arguing the overall benefits to the economy which it says will be spurred by corporations eager to reinvest in american jobs republicans plan to use controversial dynamic scoring which assumes the effects of economic growth to determine the tax plan s effect on the budget while cutting the corporate rate is straightforward assuring that other businesses that file individual tax returns pay a 15 rate is much more complicated advertisement those companies are known as pass through businesses because their income passes through the individual tax code many are small owner operated firms but pass throughs also can be large partnerships such as hedge funds law firms and some of trump s own businesses mnuchin said the tax plan would be structured so the 15 rate won t be a loophole for rich people who should be paying higher rates he provided no details democrats and many budget analysts are skeptical that trump can slash business taxes without causing budget deficits to soar advertisement we definitely need tax reform as a way to grow the economy said maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible federal budget but she said higher economic growth won t offset the plan s lost revenue and it needs to be paid for by reducing tax breaks or other measures what i don t want to see is that this tax reform is going to be paid for by magic she said advertisement steven m rosenthal a senior fellow at the urban brookings tax policy center predicted that wealthy and sophisticated taxpayers would exploit the drop on the corporate tax rate to pay less in taxes on their income the middle and working class cannot he said this piece of their plan will exacerbate inequality and increase complexity but some conservative groups applauded americans for prosperity called it a giant leap forward advertisement trump s interest in announcing the plan this week appeared to catch some of his advisors and allies on capitol hill off guard the president has dismissed the 100 day measuring stick a tradition for presidents since the 1930s as irrelevant but he also has pushed his aides to make a vigorous case for his accomplishments ahead of saturday s 100th day in office a major legislative achievement has been a big gap on his early resume hampered by the failure to craft a viable replacement plan for president obama s signature healthcare bill advertisement putting forth a partial tax plan at this stage carries risks trump has made other bold pushes only to retreat which could hurt his negotiating position on capitol hill he gave lawmakers an ultimatum during the house healthcare debate demanding an up or down vote only to pull back at the last minute to preserve negotiations for later the bill was pulled before a vote to avoid a loss on the floor this week he backed down from a showdown with congress over funding his signature promise to build a border wall in a supplemental budget request choosing to fight for money later rather than risk a partial government shutdown on friday advertisement staff writer lisa mascaro contributed to this article noah

ever since he set his departure date from the bank of england there has been speculation about what mark carney will do next there are not that many bigger jobs around than his current one but one of them has become available after the news of christine lagarde s planned departure from the international monetary fund for the european central bank carney would certainly like a move to washington not least because the other job he has had his eye on prime minister of canada is currently occupied by justin trudeau asked at a bank press conference whether he is interested carney replied he had lots of admiration for lagarde and that the proper processes should be followed what he pointedly didn t say was no carney is qualified to run the imf he ran canada s central bank before his arrival in threadneedle street in 2013 he has chaired the financial stability board the body set up by the g20 to oversee reforms of the global banking system after the near meltdown of 2008 he has been at the forefront of international moves to prepare the financial system for climate related risks philip hammond says that when carney speaks at international meetings the other participants put down their smart phones and listen a courtesy offered to only an elite few but none of that might matter because carney is canadian that s relevant because under a stitch up that dates back to the creation of the post war financial global organisations 75 years ago a european runs the imf and an american holds the reins at the world bank carney holds british and irish passports and has some influential friends in europe mario draghi at the ecb for one but will struggle to make the case that he is european rather than canadian it goes without saying that none of this should have any bearing on who succeeds lagarde the right way to appoint a new managing director of the imf would be to decide what the organisation is actually for and then choose the most suitable person to run it regardless of their place of birth or their nationality for the fund this means three three things to return it to its original mission of helping countries out of balance of payments troubles without crippling them with austerity to help countries meet the 2020 un sustainable development goals and to meet the challenge of global heating over the years and particularly since countries such as china india and brazil have become important sources of growth the us europe gentleman s agreement has looked more and more of an anachronism in 1980 global economic output was split 60 40 in favour of advanced western economies today it is the other way round but when the us citizen jim yong kim unexpectedly resigned as president of the world bank earlier this year it came as absolutely no surprise that the europeans left it to the white house to appoint a successor after rubber stamping david malpass for the bank the europeans will expect a quid pro quo from the us when it comes to the imf the process for filling the top jobs at both organisations is supposed to be open transparent and merit based but the advanced nations continue to have a stranglehold on the bretton woods organisations despite the warm words everybody knows that lagarde s successor will be a european that s why carney wouldn t have a prayer without a british or irish passport and it is why george osborne was quick to register an interest osborne would be a terrible choice for the imf he showed no interest in the organisation when he was chancellor other than to seek support in washington for his austerity programme at home but he knows how the process works a successful candidate needs to get the backing of their own government and also be well thought of by other countries the former chancellor will have done his prospects no harm by backing boris johnson to be prime minister and has reminded the europeans that he was quick to back lagarde when she became imf s managing director in 2011 nor given the european commission s obsession with budgetary orthodoxy will austerity count necessarily against him even so the portents for carney or osborne getting the imf gig are not great britain has a poor track record when it comes to grabbing the top international jobs there has never been a briton heading the organisation for economic cooperation and development or the world trade organisation as for the imf of the 11 managing directors one has been a belgian one a dutchman one a german one a spaniard and two have been swedes the remaining five have been french including the last two sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk emmanuel macron will no doubt be telling fellow eu leaders that pierre moscovici the european commissioner for economic and financial affairs has what it takes to replace lagarde but they think it is time for another country to have a turn in only 12 of the past 56 years has a french man or woman not run the imf the recent horse trading for the top eu jobs resulted in germany getting the presidency of the european commission and france getting the plum post at the ecb spain and belgium got the other two jobs up for grabs which meant there was nothing for eastern europe the signs are good therefore for kristalina georgieva she is bulgarian she is a former vice president of the european commission she is number two to malpass at the world bank and knows how the bretton woods institutions work and she is good at her job if it is to be a european georgieva ticks a lot of boxes
many central banks are rethinking their approach to the environmental and social impact of their operations this is because their decisions can affect access to housing healthcare education work to adequate food and water and the security of their pensions at the one planet summit in paris two years ago a network of central banks and supervisors was set up with the main focus on climate change now with 40 members from five continents the network is drawn to pay more attention to other environmental and social considerations the precise mandates of central banks vary but one thing they all have in common is responsibility for maintaining price stability their primary policy tools for achieving this objective are interest rates the capital and reserve requirements for banks and trading debt instruments in financial markets central banks also act as a lender of last resort to the banking system or more generally to the financial sector they regulate and supervise the activities of banks and other financial institutions they manage the country s payment system maintain financial stability and manage the country s foreign exchange reserves in some countries the central bank can be given additional responsibilities such as promoting development finance or financial inclusion to fully understand the risk that climate poses to price and financial stability central banks need to consider how changing weather patterns will affect a number of variables these include food production migration patterns and people s access to food water housing and jobs and how these in turn influence aggregate demand credit allocation inflation and government deficits in other words as i explain in more detail in this article central bankers are being inexorably pushed to reconsider the relationship between central banking and human rights the connections the mandates powers and governance arrangements of all central banks are established by law they must comply with all the applicable law including the constitutional and international legal obligations of their home states in principle this means that central banks are bound by the international human rights commitments of their sovereigns historically central banks have been able to avoid dealing with human rights issues this is because the political leadership determines the price stability goal for the economy and then lets the central bank decide how to meet this inflation objective this arrangement suggests that the central bank s independence is limited to the technical issues relevant to achieving the goal set by the government in addition it assumes at least implicitly that the social and environmental implications of the country s monetary and financial goals are the government s responsibility however in reality central banking is not a purely technical function for example the social and environmental impact of its decision to change interest rates will vary depending on how it implements the decision if the central bank decides to change interest rates through open market operations the social and environmental impacts will depend on which instruments it chooses to trade and in what proportions on the other hand these affects will depend on the decisions of banks if it implements the decision by changing the reserve requirements or the interest rate it charges banks for short term loans there are some noteworthy examples the central banks of kenya the netherlands and the federal reserve bank of san francisco consider factors such as community development and financial inclusion in their stewardship of their financial systems and the dutch central bank now has a mandate to include sustainability in its decision making the chinese central bank has been authorised to take climate considerations into account in its monetary decisions central bank operations therefore cannot avoid affecting human rights the human rights responsibilities the unavoidable impact of central banking operations on human rights means that central banks have to develop a better understanding of their human rights responsibilities the applicable law is the starting point but the relevant law and jurisprudence is unlikely to provide detailed guidance on how central banks should interpret and implement their human rights responsibilities a good reference tool for the central bank is the un guiding principles on business and human rights these principles stipulate that all businesses should have a human rights policy the policy should be publicly available and should be applicable to all the business s operations and decision making the principles also state that businesses should conduct adequate human rights due diligence before and during their decision making and implementation process this requirement means that they should conduct human rights impact assessments of their proposed operations they should also take steps to avoid or mitigate the identified adverse human rights impacts central banks will face particular challenges in meeting their human rights responsibilities their instrument independence means that their human rights policy will need to be respectful of the central bank s independence and its mandate at the same time the central bank needs to be cognisant of the fact that its human rights policy may have implications for other state entities and for the country s political leadership these considerations complicate but do not render impossible the task of drafting a central bank human rights policy their ability to conduct detailed human rights impact assessments will be complicated by the relative speed and discretion with which they must often operate this does not however make it impossible for them to assess their impact on human rights instead it suggests that central banks need to develop and maintain a sufficiently detailed general and ongoing understanding of the actual impact of their operations on human rights this is so that they can make informed judgements about the likely effects of their proposed monetary decisions on specific communities this disaggregated approach should provide central banks with a detailed and nuanced understanding of how their policies actually affect different sub groups of their society by doing this it should enable central banks to determine the true costs and benefits of their policies and actions this should improve their decision making conclusion this analysis demonstrates three key points first it is becoming untenable for central banks to avoid incorporating their human rights impacts into their decision making and operations second a human rights approach offers central banks a new tool for understanding the true costs and benefits of their operations third central banks can meet their human rights responsibilities without compromising the independence they need to meet their monetary and financial responsibilities author danny bradlow

elzy kolb and samuel stebbins 24 7 wall street no other issue other than climate change is a truly global concern global temperatures are projected to rise between 2 5 10 degrees fahrenheit over the next century according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change a group of over 1 300 scientists from the u s and around the world the impacts of climate change are already being felt and will likely only intensify over time the scope of the impact of climate change is difficult to overstate everything from wildlife ecosystems agriculture and human health will all be affected on a global scale already the effect is felt worldwide a global problem requires a global solution and when it comes to protecting the environment for future generations some countries are doing more than others 24 7 wall st created an index to measure environmental performance by country using data from yale university s 2018 environmental performance index and the world bank s what a waste database the measures that comprise this index range in scope and include air quality water quality biodiversity wastewater treatment carbon emissions and proactive environmental policies it is important to note that the high ranking countries on this list are not necessarily exemplary at resource management and per capita waste several of the countries that rank high in certain measures of environmental stewardship are some of the same countries that produce the most waste poorest countries these are the 25 poorest countries in the world richest countries these are the 25 richest countries in the world addressing environmental issues costs money and many poorer nations lack the resources necessary to tackle even the most pressing environmental problems in fact many of the countries doing the least to protect the environment also rank among the 25 poorest countries in the world conversely many of the countries doing the most rank among the world s richest countries countries doing the most

the least to protect their environment 100 of its population is exposed to air pollution levels exceeding the world health organization s guidelines but it ranks among the highest in this group when it comes to the percentage of the protected terrestrial and marine area despite that the southern african nation is likely to find itself embroiled in conservationist controversy for the foreseeable future following its may 22 decision to end its ban on elephant hunting 13 sudan population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 2 8 gdp per capita 4 467 sudan is a nation in turmoil south sudan split off from sudan in 2011 taking a big piece of oil revenue with it a civil war broke out in south sudan in 2013 and sudan has become a destination for refugees and asylum seekers the northern african country s resources are stretched thin by this series of events but it is supported by the un in preparing its first state of the environment and outlook report aiming to help the government make informed decisions and adopt an integrated approach to understanding the link between social and economic development 12 malawi population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 22 9 gdp per capita 1 095 the simple and necessary act of cooking a meal is a source of environmental concern in malawi one of the world s poorest countries very few people in the country have access to electricity so most meals are prepared on wood fires the demand for wood and charcoal contributes to deforestation with an estimated 3 of malawi s forests lost each year and the smoke from the wood fires takes its toll on air quality releasing hundreds of substances into the air including particulates soot carcinogens carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons leading to lung disease with women and children particularly susceptible among malawi s sustainable development goals are ensuring access to modern sustainable affordable and reliable energy for all and enact sustainable water management practices 11 chad population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 20 4 gdp per capita 1 768 the good news is that in the years since 24 7 wall st last reported on the countries doing the least to protect the environment chad has increased its terrestrial and marine protected areas from 17 8 of land to 20 4 today the bad news is that only 9 5 of the population has access to basic sanitation and many deaths are related to unsafe water and sanitation and the lack of hygienic conditions chad s environmental goals include reducing air pollution from vehicle emissions dropping lead levels in fuel and lowering emissions from biomass burning 10 guinea bissau population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 11 6 gdp per capita 1 549 environmental protections are necessities that can feel like luxuries in desperately poor countries where a large percentage of the population lacks regular access to food potable water and basic sanitation add political instability to the equation and it s easy to imagine sustainability and green policies sliding down the priority list guinea bissau fits that description with almost 70 of the population living below the poverty line and as much as half of the population food insecure in some regions the west african country has been in chronic political turmoil since it gained independence in 1974 9 uganda population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 16 1 gdp per capita 1 698 uganda is one of several african nations lagging behind most countries in the world in terms of environmental protection efforts between 1990 and 2016 a period over which most countries reported improved air quality the concentration of harmful fine air pollution known as pm2 5 increased by 21 3 in uganda rapid population growth in the country is leading to mass deforestation and oil exploration in the albertine rift valley continues as the country has an evident lack of alternative energy sources 8 rwanda population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 9 1 gdp per capita 1 857 as in many other african nations on this list many of rwanda s environmental problems stem from rapid population growth straining natural resources major issues include deforestation loss of biodiversity reduced soil fertility and poaching even though the country faces considerable threats from climate change it s not well equipped to address the increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts within its borders many of the rwandan government s initiatives to combat environmental deterioration like increasing forest cover to 30 by 2020 are being stymied by rapid population growth 7 iraq population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 1 5 gdp per capita 15 393 less than 2 of land in iraq is protected by the government among the least of any country in the world protected lands include reserves with limited public access like national parks wildlife sanctuaries protected landscapes and areas managed for sustainable use environmental challenges in the country are also a product of several recent wars poor land use planning and the destructive human impact on unprotected fragile ecosystems currently the country faces water quality and shortage issues poor soil and ecosystem deterioration these problems are expected to only get worse as a result of global warming 6 sierra leone population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 3 3 gdp per capita 1 391 the government of sierra leone has protected only 3 3 of the country s territory from environmental damage a far smaller share than most countries indeed much of the country s environmental problems are a product of unrestricted mineral excavation specifically diamonds and resulting deforestation recently a mudslide attributable to deforestation killed over 1 000 people in the country and displaced nearly 5 000 others sierra leone is among the world s poorest countries and many who live there rely on untreated polluted water supplies additionally everyone living in the country is exposed to unsafe levels of air pollution 5 djibouti population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 1 2 gdp per capita 2 705 djibouti is a barren country of nearly 90 desert and the country s government has fallen short on land use planning and water treatment and management djibouti is also particularly susceptible to the effects of global warming and needs to build up coastal protections shore up landfill walls and install drainage systems for water among other precautionary measures deforestation is depleting the country s already limited wooded areas currently only 1 2 of the country s territory is protected as national parks wildlife reserves and sanctuaries or areas managed for sustainable use additionally the presence of harmful fine particle pollution has climbed by 54 3 between 1990 and 2016 and everyone who lives in djibouti is exposed to harmful levels of air pollution 4 eritrea population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 3 0 gdp per capita 1 510 though eritrea has signed the paris agreement on climate change and issued a proclamation in 2017 for environmental protection and restoration it continues to be among the nations with the fewest environmental protections only about 11 of the population have access to basic sanitation services droughts floods and irregular rain patterns have led to soil erosion desertification and land degradation 3 lesotho population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 0 3 gdp per capita 2 665 lesotho in southeastern africa has almost no protected marine or terrestrial areas destruction of groundcovers and an abundance of surface water have led to soil exhaustion and erosion the lesotho highlands water project uses dams and tunnels to channel some of the excess surface water to south africa and generate hydroelectricity a second phase of the project is expected to be completed in 2020 2 haiti population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 0 4 gdp per capita 1 653 the caribbean island nation of haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere with millions of people subsisting below the poverty line it s also prone to natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes deforestation soil erosion sedimentation in coastal waters water pollution and poor waste management are among the environmental challenges a variety of government agencies and ngos are assisting haiti in developing more sustainable agricultural and business practices 1 burundi population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 7 6 gdp per capita 668 carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production rose in burundi by a whopping 183 2 between 2007 and 2017 deforestation disappearance of wetlands and water pollution are among the pressing environmental issues in the east central africa nation with a tiny per capita gdp of 668 burundi is among the poorest nations in the world with almost 75 of the population living below the poverty line and there is little awareness of environmental protection practices burundi has signed the paris agreement to fight back against climate change but the road to the country taking any environmental measures when it struggles with so many issues is bound to be

i was raised in a company house in a company town where the miners had to buy their own oilers that is rubber coveralls drill bits and other tools at the company store that company inco limited the world s leading producer of nickel for most of the 20th century controlled the town of sudbury ontario but never succeeded in owning the souls of the men and women who lived and worked there that s because these were union men and women self possessed a little rowdy and well aware that puny pleas from individual workers fall on deaf corporate ears as i prepare to retire in a couple of days 54 years after starting work as a copper puncher at the inco smelter the relationship between massive multinational corporations and workers is different unions represent a much smaller percentage of workers now so few that some don t even know what a labor organization is or what organized labor can accomplish that is the result of deliberate decades long attacks on unions by corporations and the rich they intend to own not only workers time and production but their very souls i d like to tell you the story of inco because it illustrates the arc of labor union ascendance and attenuation over the past 72 years since i was born in sudbury when i was a boy the inco workers about 19 000 of them were represented by the international union of mine mill and smelter workers the union was gathering strength my dad wilfred gerard was among the rabble rousers we lived just a few miles from the mine and workers would gather at the house someone would bring a case of beer and my mom would make egg salad or bologna sandwiches conditions in the mine were terrible and these workers were organizing to achieve change i recall them talking about a work stoppage over safety glasses i was amazed that they would have to take action like that to get essential work equipment the company i thought should voluntarily take this simple step to ensure workers were not unnecessarily injured on the job i learned two important lessons from sitting on the steps and listening to those meetings one was that the company would do nothing for the workers unless forced by collective action the other was that labor unions were instruments of both economic and social justice i started work in the smelter at age 18 after graduating high school my mother told my girlfriend susan my future wife not to let me get involved in the union because if i did i would be gone all of the time for a few years i resisted union activism still i carried a copy of the labor contract in my pocket pulled out just high enough so the boss could see it i knew what it said and i wanted him to know i knew in 1967 when i was 20 the international union of mine mill and smelter workers merged with the united steelworkers usw and i became a usw member it didn t take long for the guys at the smelter to see that i had a big mouth and in 1969 they petitioned for me to become a shop steward that was the beginning my mom was right it did mean i was gone much of the time i got myself demoted so i could work day shifts and attend college at night on day shift i noticed the company was using a bunch of contractors many were performing work that was supposed to be done by union members other contractors sat in their trucks parked behind the warehouse doing nothing so i got about six guys to help me track and record the violations every day then we would file grievances against the company we could not win because the contract language was weak at that point but we took it through all the stages of grieving and it cost inco money that made the bosses furious so they took it out on me you have to be prepared for that if you are going to be an activist they made me rake rocks that had fallen off the mine trucks onto the road they made me pick up trash in the parking lot they tried to humiliate me but i always found a way to comply without bowing to them the advantage we had in those days was that they thought they were smarter than us they didn t understand that we were a team and we stuck together so there was no way they were going to own us that was the 1960s a different time union membership in the united states rose through 1965 when nearly one in three workers belonged in canada the rise continued through 1985 when the rate was 38 percent the drop off in the united states was fairly slow until 1980 when it plummeted to 23 2 percent it has now fallen to 10 5 percent in canada the decline was steady but much slower the rate there remains 30 1 percent close to the all time high in the united states the difference is that in the united states corporations and conservatives engaged in a successful campaign beginning in 1971 to seize power from workers and propagandize for what they euphemistically called free enterprise really it s cutthroat capitalism the upshot is that u s workers have more difficulty forming unions than canadians and u s corporations can more easily lock workers out of their jobs and hire strikebreakers the intent is to enable corporations to own their workers lock stock and soul lewis powell the late u s supreme court justice launched this drive to crush labor the left and environmentalists in the united states with a memo he wrote in 1971 for the u s chamber of commerce and distributed to corporate leaders powell told the chamber that it had to organize businesses into a political force because he claimed corporations and the free market system were under broad attack and in deep trouble he inveighed against regulations sought by car safety activist ralph nader by environmentalists petitioning for clean air and water and by unions demanding less deadly mines and manufacturing he castigated those on the left pursuing a fairer safer and more humane society businesses must cultivate political power and wield it powell said to secure free market advantages such as tax breaks and loopholes specifically for corporations and the rich powell also told the chamber strength lies in organization in careful long range planning and implementation in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years in the scale of financing available only through joint effort and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations that is exactly what the chamber achieved it catalyzed a business movement funded by wealthy conservative family and corporate foundations including those of coors olin scaife and koch to name a few the foundations sponsored conservative professors at universities and right wing non profits such as the heritage foundation the cato institute americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec which provides junkets for right wing lawmakers at which it encourages them to champion anti union and anti worker legislation these groups bankrolled conservative candidates and secured appointments of conservative judges between the end of world war ii and 1970 during the rise of unions workers incomes rose with productivity income inequality declined and north america became home to the largest middle class in history after 1970 and the chamber effort to implement the powell manifesto unions declined and workers wages stagnated virtually all new income and profits went to ceos stockholders and the already rich the middle class dwindled as income inequality rose to gilded age levels this occurred at the same time that corporations expanded becoming massive multinationals with facilities sprawled across the world and without allegiance to any country this happened to inco vale a brazilian corporation bought it in 2006 and now vale is a true multinational with facilities worldwide multinationals spurned their obligation to serve workers consumers communities and shareholders instead they focused only on shareholders the rest be damned they closed factories in the united states and canada and moved them to places like mexico and china with low wages and lax environmental laws they exploited foreign workers and destroyed north american workers lives and communities as far back as the 1970s the usw the afl cio as well as the textile shoe steel and other industry leaders warned congress about what this trend combined with increasing imports meant for american workers and their neighborhoods in 1973 after the united states experienced its first two years of trade deficits in a century i w abel then president of the usw urged congress to slow the massive flood of imports that are sweeping away jobs and industries in wholesale lots congress failure to heed this alarm resulted in the collapse of the u s textile and shoe industries and many others it very nearly killed the steel industry which has suffered tsunami after tsunami of bankruptcies gunpoint mergers and mill closures tens of thousands of family supporting jobs were lost and communities across both the united states and canada hollowed out in 1971 and 1972 the trade deficit totaled 8 4 billion last year it was 621 billion every imported toy shoe bolt of cloth and ingot of steel means fewer u s factories and jobs and more struggling towns the usw presidents who followed abel lloyd mcbride and lynn r williams escalated the battle against offshored factories and unfairly traded imports the usw even filed suit to try to stop the north american free trade agreement nafta because williams like independent presidential candidate ross perot saw that it would suck canadian and u s factories and jobs south of the mexican border a sticker created by the usw to use on posters and billboards internationally during the strike courtesy of united steelworkers the late usw president george becker and i agitated for change confronting and cajoling presidents and prime ministers and members of congress and parliament the usw martialed all of its forces including activists in its women of steel and nextgen programs the steelworkers organization of active retirees and its rapid response coordinators tens of thousands of workers rallied camped out in washington d c harangued lawmakers and sent postcards working with allies in the community such as environmental and human rights groups faith and food safety organizations together we have won some short term relief measures these include the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imposed last year and the defeat of the proposed new trade deal the trans pacific partnership that would have extended nafta problems across pacific rim countries in the decades that the usw battled bad trade i moved through the ranks from staff representative to district director to canadian national director to usw secretary treasurer among my goals was to forge international workers alliances to combat the corporate cabals that always got seats at the table to write the trade deals that worked against workers when i was elected usw president in 2001 one of my top priorities was expanding the union s coalitions now the usw participates in three global unions which together represent more than 82 million workers in more than 150 countries worldwide the usw and partner unions also created more than two dozen global councils of workers including those for workers at arcelormittal basf bridgestone dowdupont and gerdau these employers quickly learned that taking on workers at one factory meant taking on workers at all of their workplaces internationally in 2005 the usw and the mexican miners union known as los mineros formed a strategic alliance and the usw gave los mineros general secretary napoleon gomez sanctuary in canada when he was unjustly accused of wrongdoing by a mexican government intent on shutting him up after a mine disaster in 2008 the usw joined with unite the union the second largest union in the uk and ireland forming workers uniting to fight exploitation and injustice globally and the usw formed alliances with union federations in australia and brazil where the organization is known as the cut this international brotherhood and sisterhood stood with canadian mine and smelter workers for a year beginning in july 2009 during its first negotiations with the usw vale the brazilian corporation that bought inco demanded harsh concessions from its thousands of canadian workers though vale was highly profitable it said it wouldn t even bargain with the usw unless the workers first accepted the cuts that forced them out on strike i started talking regularly with the head of the cut in brazil to strategize and plan joint actions brazilian workers and community groups wholeheartedly supported their canadian brothers and sisters they demonstrated in front of the vale headquarters and threw red paint symbolizing blood on the building they shut down traffic with all sorts of street actions they protested at the vale shareholders meeting inside and out they also traveled to canada in force with flags for a rally in sudbury in march of 2010 when the strike was eight months old and banks were repossessing some workers cars and foreclosing on homes by then vale had 100 000 workers in mines and smelters across the world supporters from many of those communities in asia africa europe and australia joined thousands of canadians who marched through the streets that cold day vale could see that its canadian workers in sudbury port colborne and voisey s bay were not alone they had allies from around the world willing to stand up to the giant multinational the strike ended 12 long months after it started we didn t get everything we wanted but we certainly didn t accept vale s concessionary demands vale failed to accomplish its mission which was to spread to all of its operations worldwide the authoritarian top down nasty management practices that it had honed in brazil the proof of that is the next round of negotiations with vale went fairly well and we got an honorable settlement now for labor to secure gains in the united states or canada or anywhere workers must mobilize we have to bring everyone together women men poor people people of color gay people all working people none of us is big enough or developed enough to win this fight alone if we fight together i can t guarantee we will win but if we don t fight for justice i can guarantee we will lose since none of us is willing to owe our souls to the company store we re going to have to find ways to continue building coalitions robust enough to confront capital and win the battle for economic and social justice
federal reserve chairman jerome powell might be willing to stand up to the white house but is reluctant to rock the boat on wall street in his congressional testimony on wednesday powell reaffirmed the strength of the u s economy but much of the focus was on the crosscurrents and challenges he cited characterizations market observers broadly interpreted as a signal that the central bank will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its july meeting markets are fully expecting a rate cut at month end and powell did nothing to dissuade that said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate his comments today really reiterated a step a move closer towards more accommodative policy said charlie ripley senior investment strategist at allianz investment management in our view that s moving closer to the idea of these insurance rate cuts although he reiterated that the expectation of economic growth remains solid powell indicated that softer data raised fears of a slowdown since the fed s last statement in june it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the u s economic outlook he said powell expressed concern about slower global growth trade issues brexit and the debt ceiling along with important longer run challenges like lagging labor force participation and productivity growth as well as the longer term effects of high and rising federal debt it sounds very dovish said zhiwei ren managing director and portfolio manager at penn mutual asset management they re trying to find a reason to cut they re trying to justify the cut you can see this rhetoric all over the statement his emphasis is always on the negatives he said despite a robust june employment report economists noted that powell s testimony largely dismissed this saying the fed is correct to look at data that reveals a less rosy picture nonfarm payrolls are slowing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america employment is a lagging indicator and they ve got to look forward he said adding that some economic data wasn t as positive as it first appeared the first quarter gdp report was pretty skewed by inventories and net exports he said trade also emerged as a major concern although the fed s june statement didn t mention the topic at all powell s testimony today mentioned it eight times you have tremendous uncertainty caused by the u s china trade conflict ren said business investment is a huge driver of economic growth he added but powell noted that this had dropped as of late a trend attributable to the unwillingness of companies to sink money into initiatives that could be undercut by soaring tariffs or disrupted supply chains analysts also said powell wanted to avoid injecting volatility into financial markets more generally since market expectations for a july rate cut are at 100 percent although not officially part of the fed s mandate experts said it had little choice but to deliver on this expectation there s been a tremendous amount of uncertainty particularly relating to the global trade front ripley said i would say at least at this point there will be a little bit more confidence in the market the stock market in particular is behaving like a kid who s throwing a temper tantrum mcbride said the market wants a rate cut and they want it now powell also responded to president donald trump s ongoing criticism of his leadership affirming the fed s autonomy and stressing more than once that the fed will always focus on doing the job that you have assigned us he dismissed the notion that emotion would play into any rate decision saying that monetary policy is guided by rational analytical data parsing it s reassuring to markets that powell is staunchly defending the fed s independence said mcbride any waffling on that could undermine the fed s credibility and be a risk to markets

elzy kolb and samuel stebbins 24 7 wall street no other issue other than climate change is a truly global concern global temperatures are projected to rise between 2 5 10 degrees fahrenheit over the next century according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change a group of over 1 300 scientists from the u s and around the world the impacts of climate change are already being felt and will likely only intensify over time the scope of the impact of climate change is difficult to overstate everything from wildlife ecosystems agriculture and human health will all be affected on a global scale already the effect is felt worldwide a global problem requires a global solution and when it comes to protecting the environment for future generations some countries are doing more than others 24 7 wall st created an index to measure environmental performance by country using data from yale university s 2018 environmental performance index and the world bank s what a waste database the measures that comprise this index range in scope and include air quality water quality biodiversity wastewater treatment carbon emissions and proactive environmental policies it is important to note that the high ranking countries on this list are not necessarily exemplary at resource management and per capita waste several of the countries that rank high in certain measures of environmental stewardship are some of the same countries that produce the most waste poorest countries these are the 25 poorest countries in the world richest countries these are the 25 richest countries in the world addressing environmental issues costs money and many poorer nations lack the resources necessary to tackle even the most pressing environmental problems in fact many of the countries doing the least to protect the environment also rank among the 25 poorest countries in the world conversely many of the countries doing the most rank among the world s richest countries countries doing the most

of climate action alerting the public to the dangers of climate change increased regulations on discarding food plastics and e waste and turning a greater focus on sustainability it looks as though young people are poised to take a leading role in green initiatives as 60 of students in singapore took part in the sec starhub school green awards which encourages young people to turn their passion for the environment into action 12 romania population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 98 area with gov protection 24 3 gdp per capita 23 505 romania is working with the world bank to reach its goals in fighting climate change and striving for low carbon development among the collaboration s objectives are developing an environmental strategy and action plan identifying carbon trading opportunities and building a knowledge base for impact assessment and decision making more than 24 of romania s terrestrial and marine areas are protected and between 2006 and 2016 carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption dropped by more than 33 the level of carbon emissions from fossil fuels and cement production is also down by 26 3 industry related air and water pollution in romania is linked to acid rain high greenhouse gas levels and industrial runoff into the river system 11 belarus population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 99 9 area with gov protection 9 4 gdp per capita 17 175 belarus is one of several countries that benefited from the united nations development programme which aimed to promote economic growth through environmentally sustainable means the project which stretched from 2014 to 2017 resulted in nearly two dozen pilot projects including a motor oil collection and processing system in the barysau and krupki districts and the country s first forest educational center in horni park lida district the project also created 50 new green jobs additionally the presence of dangerous fine particulate matter declined by 40 8 in the country from 1990 to 2016 10 hungary population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 22 6 gdp per capita 26 861 hungary has made considerable progress in environmental protection in recent years the landlocked central european country has managed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 35 since 1990 additionally the country is on track to more than meet or exceed its goal of 14 7 renewable energy by 2020 hungary is also exemplary in its protection of its land slightly more than 22 of the country s territory is protected by the government a larger than typical share still as is the case with every country on this list more progress needs to be made fossil fuels still account for over 70 of hungary s energy and the country has one of the worst mortality rates due to air pollution among oecd countries 9 trinidad and tobago population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 2 0 gdp per capita 28 763 a regional leader in environmental protection trinidad and tobago is the only caribbean nation to rank on this list economic growth has historically been driven by environmentally harmful means such as mining and deforestation now the country is shifting toward more environmentally sustainable growth practices which the island nation s government acknowledges is essential for both businesses and communities in the country the government is leading by example pledging to conserve resources and energy adhere to sustainable waste management practices reduce pollution and reduce output of harmful greenhouse gases the presence of dangerous fine particulate air pollution declined by 13 3 in the country from 1990 to 2016 8 bulgaria population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 99 9 area with gov protection 28 3 gdp per capita 18 606 since joining the european union in 2007 bulgaria has made significant strides toward developing an environmentally sustainable economy in accordance with eu directives including working towards the goal of 16 renewable energy by 2020 results are already evident the presence of dangerous pm2 5 air pollution declined by 43 3 in the country from 1990 to 2016 the bulgarian government also protects much of its land over 28 of the country s lands are reserves with limited public access like national parks wildlife sanctuaries protected landscapes and areas managed for sustainable use 7 united states population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 3 3 area with gov protection 26 3 gdp per capita 54 471 despite the internationally criticized 2017 decision to withdraw from the paris agreement a multinational accord to collectively combat global warming the u s ranks among the 10 countries doing the most to protect the environment over a quarter of u s territory is protected reserves with limited public access like national parks wildlife sanctuaries and areas managed for sustainable use a larger share than most countries additionally only 3 3 of the u s population are exposed to unsafe levels of air pollution under the trump administration s 2020 budget proposal funding for the environmental protection agency will be slashed by 31 should these cuts take effect the u s may not remain one of the global leaders in environmental protection for long 6 canada population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 0 area with gov protection 6 5 gdp per capita 44 018 though only 6 5 of the terrestrial and marine areas are protected in canada that s still a lot of area when you take into consideration it is the second largest country on the globe in landmass the country comprises burgeoning urban areas the fragile arctic circle and a variety of terrains in between environmental achievements include supporting climate friendly technology leading to energy efficiency renewable energy and sustainable urban transportation reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing biodiversity planning and protection for land and sea challenges include rapid warming in the formerly frozen solid north the impact of air pollution on wildlife vegetation water and soil and acid rain 5 australia population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 24 9 area with gov protection 29 7 gdp per capita 44 643 right behind its neighbor new zealand australia has the second highest percentage of protected terrestrial and marine areas of countries on this list there was however an 8 4 increase in consumption emissions between 2006 and 2016 and a 3 2 hike in carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production earlier this year a report by the oecd condemned australia s record on emissions and declared the country not on the right path to meet its 2030 goals under the paris agreement but the country has also been cited for its environmental achievements including its plastic bag ban its strategy to halve food waste and the construction of the world s largest lithium battery to more effectively store wind energy 4 new zealand population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 0 area with gov protection 30 5 gdp per capita 36 013 watching the lord of the rings and the hobbit movies may be as close as many of us will get to enjoying new zealand s pristine air but apparently those sparkling clean skies are real and not cgi as evidenced by the 0 of the population exposed to unsafe fine particle air pollution levels almost one third of the terrestrial and marine area is protected the highest share among the top 15 countries doing the most to protect the environment new zealand met targets for reducing greenhouse emissions set under the first kyoto protocol and it has set additional reduction goals for 2020 2030 and 2050 still even if you re doing a great job there s always room for improvement the wwf notes that deforestation soil erosion and destruction of wildlife habitats continue to be problems 3 norway population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 2 area with gov protection 5 1 gdp per capita 64 965 thanks to an abundance of hydro power norway s power system is practically 100 renewable nevertheless the northern nation has somewhat higher per capita greenhouse emissions than other countries in europe and asia norway which signed the kyoto protocol hopes to reduce that number in the coming year carbon neutrality by 2050 is another goal with that said only 5 1 of the terrestrial and marine areas in norway are protected among the lowest percentages of the 15 countries doing the most to protect the environment 2 finland population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 0 area with gov protection 14 2 gdp per capita 41 018 finland is known as one of the most environmentally friendly countries on earth thanks largely to its almost unbelievable achievement of having 0 of its population exposed to unsafe levels of fine particle air pollution according to the who one of the world s wealthiest industrialized countries finland clearly has the wherewithal to support vigorous green policies aiming to anticipate risks and prevent damage before any harm is done ongoing environmental goals include reducing per capita greenhouse emissions significantly increasing the use of renewable energy and protecting forest and farmland habitats 1 denmark population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 56 9 area with gov protection 17 9 gdp per capita 47 270 denmark already ranked high when we reported on this topic in 2017 the country has continued to make strides forward in air quality in particular on the previous report 78 8 of the population was exposed to unsafe levels of fine particle air pollution now the figure has dropped to 56 9 denmark tops the list of countries doing the most to protect the environment and continues to set ambitious goals among them having at least half its energy consumption come from renewables by 2030 and to be independent of fossil fuels by 2050 countries doing the least to protect the environment 15 sao tome and principe population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 0 2 gdp per capita 3 053 there s a clear link between a nation s wealth and its ability to protect the environment so it s no surprise that sao tome and principe with its tiny per capita gdp of just over 3 000 ranks among the worst in the world about 50 of the land is used for agriculture in this small island nation that is less than 1 000 square kilometers roughly five times larger than washington d c situated off the west coast of africa sao tome and principe s environmental challenges include deforestation soil erosion and inadequate treatment of sewage in urban areas 14 botswana population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 29 1 gdp per capita 15 474 botswana shares a daunting statistic with the other 14 countries doing the least to protect their environment 100 of its population is exposed to air pollution levels exceeding the world health organization s guidelines but it ranks among the highest in this group when it comes to the percentage of the protected terrestrial and marine area despite that the southern african nation is likely to find itself embroiled in conservationist controversy for the foreseeable future following its may 22 decision to end its ban on elephant hunting 13 sudan population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 2 8 gdp per capita 4 467 sudan is a nation in turmoil south sudan split off from sudan in 2011 taking a big piece of oil revenue with it a civil war broke out in south sudan in 2013 and sudan has become a destination for refugees and asylum seekers the northern african country s resources are stretched thin by this series of events but it is supported by the un in preparing its first state of the environment and outlook report aiming to help the government make informed decisions and adopt an integrated approach to understanding the link between social and economic development 12 malawi population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 22 9 gdp per capita 1 095 the simple and necessary act of cooking a meal is a source of environmental concern in malawi one of the world s poorest countries very few people in the country have access to electricity so most meals are prepared on wood fires the demand for wood and charcoal contributes to deforestation with an estimated 3 of malawi s forests lost each year and the smoke from the wood fires takes its toll on air quality releasing hundreds of substances into the air including particulates soot carcinogens carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons leading to lung disease with women and children particularly susceptible among malawi s sustainable development goals are ensuring access to modern sustainable affordable and reliable energy for all and enact sustainable water management practices 11 chad population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 20 4 gdp per capita 1 768 the good news is that in the years since 24 7 wall st last reported on the countries doing the least to protect the environment chad has increased its terrestrial and marine protected areas from 17 8 of land to 20 4 today the bad news is that only 9 5 of the population has access to basic sanitation and many deaths are related to unsafe water and sanitation and the lack of hygienic conditions chad s environmental goals include reducing air pollution from vehicle emissions dropping lead levels in fuel and lowering emissions from biomass burning 10 guinea bissau population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 11 6 gdp per capita 1 549 environmental protections are necessities that can feel like luxuries in desperately poor countries where a large percentage of the population lacks regular access to food potable water and basic sanitation add political instability to the equation and it s easy to imagine sustainability and green policies sliding down the priority list guinea bissau fits that description with almost 70 of the population living below the poverty line and as much as half of the population food insecure in some regions the west african country has been in chronic political turmoil since it gained independence in 1974 9 uganda population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 16 1 gdp per capita 1 698 uganda is one of several african nations lagging behind most countries in the world in terms of environmental protection efforts between 1990 and 2016 a period over which most countries reported improved air quality the concentration of harmful fine air pollution known as pm2 5 increased by 21 3 in uganda rapid population growth in the country is leading to mass deforestation and oil exploration in the albertine rift valley continues as the country has an evident lack of alternative energy sources 8 rwanda population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 9 1 gdp per capita 1 857 as in many other african nations on this list many of rwanda s environmental problems stem from rapid population growth straining natural resources major issues include deforestation loss of biodiversity reduced soil fertility and poaching even though the country faces considerable threats from climate change it s not well equipped to address the increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts within its borders many of the rwandan government s initiatives to combat environmental deterioration like increasing forest cover to 30 by 2020 are being stymied by rapid population growth 7 iraq population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 1 5 gdp per capita 15 393 less than 2 of land in iraq is protected by the government among the least of any country in the world protected lands include reserves with limited public access like national parks wildlife sanctuaries protected landscapes and areas managed for sustainable use environmental challenges in the country are also a product of several recent wars poor land use planning and the destructive human impact on unprotected fragile ecosystems currently the country faces water quality and shortage issues poor soil and ecosystem deterioration these problems are expected to only get worse as a result of global warming 6 sierra leone population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 3 3 gdp per capita 1 391 the government of sierra leone has protected only 3 3 of the country s territory from environmental damage a far smaller share than most countries indeed much of the country s environmental problems are a product of unrestricted mineral excavation specifically diamonds and resulting deforestation recently a mudslide attributable to deforestation killed over 1 000 people in the country and displaced nearly 5 000 others sierra leone is among the world s poorest countries and many who live there rely on untreated polluted water supplies additionally everyone living in the country is exposed to unsafe levels of air pollution 5 djibouti population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 1 2 gdp per capita 2 705 djibouti is a barren country of nearly 90 desert and the country s government has fallen short on land use planning and water treatment and management djibouti is also particularly susceptible to the effects of global warming and needs to build up coastal protections shore up landfill walls and install drainage systems for water among other precautionary measures deforestation is depleting the country s already limited wooded areas currently only 1 2 of the country s territory is protected as national parks wildlife reserves and sanctuaries or areas managed for sustainable use additionally the presence of harmful fine particle pollution has climbed by 54 3 between 1990 and 2016 and everyone who lives in djibouti is exposed to harmful levels of air pollution 4 eritrea population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 3 0 gdp per capita 1 510 though eritrea has signed the paris agreement on climate change and issued a proclamation in 2017 for environmental protection and restoration it continues to be among the nations with the fewest environmental protections only about 11 of the population have access to basic sanitation services droughts floods and irregular rain patterns have led to soil erosion desertification and land degradation 3 lesotho population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 0 3 gdp per capita 2 665 lesotho in southeastern africa has almost no protected marine or terrestrial areas destruction of groundcovers and an abundance of surface water have led to soil exhaustion and erosion the lesotho highlands water project uses dams and tunnels to channel some of the excess surface water to south africa and generate hydroelectricity a second phase of the project is expected to be completed in 2020 2 haiti population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 0 4 gdp per capita 1 653 the caribbean island nation of haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere with millions of people subsisting below the poverty line it s also prone to natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes deforestation soil erosion sedimentation in coastal waters water pollution and poor waste management are among the environmental challenges a variety of government agencies and ngos are assisting haiti in developing more sustainable agricultural and business practices 1 burundi population exposed to unsafe air pollution levels 100 area with gov protection 7 6 gdp per capita 668 carbon emissions from fossil fuel and cement production rose in burundi by a whopping 183 2 between 2007 and 2017 deforestation disappearance of wetlands and water pollution are among the pressing environmental issues in the east central africa nation with a tiny per capita gdp of 668 burundi is among the poorest nations in the world with almost 75 of the population living below the poverty line and there is little awareness of environmental protection practices burundi has signed the paris agreement to fight back against climate change but the road to the country taking any environmental measures when it struggles with so many issues is bound to be challenging methodology to determine the most environmentally conscious countries 24 7 wall st reviewed yale university s 2018 environmental performance index epi the epi scores 180 countries on

published monday 15 july 2019 print disqus by david haggith this month the economic expansion brought to you by your federal reserve and by us government largess becomes the longest expansion in the history of the united states that s something right something let s take an honest look at what we now call great by the longest expansion we mean the longest period in which us gdp has been growing without a recession now that s something to crow about right not so fast for many reasons it s also been the most anemic expansion on the books and it s not too hard to see why it s been the longest having nothing at all to do with a great economy it has cost us far more than any expansion by an order of magnitude because we ve piled up ten times the national debt over any amount we accumulated during previous expansions i ve said before it s easy to let the good times roll when you are buying it all on the company credit card we also quadrupled the size of the size of the fed s balance sheet that didn t cost anything but we sure didn t get much bang for the buck we actually got less bang than in any previous expansion the permanent recession sure we got outstanding growth in stocks but growth in business revenue has been pathetic growth in corporate development has been even worse i e new plants improved productivity etc growth in earnings was decent except for the fact that it is entirely a feint because it was created mostly by reducing the numbers of outstanding shares over which earnings are divided not so much by growing business why do you think wall street prefers to talk about earnings per share eps instead of just actual profits we can pretend the strength in eps was because business has been booming during the long economic expansion but it wasn t we got less production growth out of this expansion than in any other expansion in us history and that is easy to prove with the fed s own data gdp went up but the rate of growth in gdp has been in secular decline during each expansion expansion periods are the periods between the gray recession zones in the fed graph below of course those are percentage changes and the higher any number gets the harder it becomes to get as big of a percentage change off that number so not so horrible right well the real numbers look worse because you see the government has changed the way it calculates gdp over the years to make things look better when measured against history if you go back to tracking gdp the way it was historically calculated if for no other reason than to keep the formula being used consistent across the chart it looks like this top line in the chart below is the line from the fed chart above bottom line is what you get if you stay with the same formula throughout the chart shadowstats oops worse than pathetic using consistent accounting through time we discover we have actually been in receding gdp recession since 2000 with the exception of one little bump in 2004 we don t want to admit that so we we ll just ignore that by saying we improved our accounting methods over time and that is why i say it s been a great recession because we never actually left the great recession rather than the longest expansion in us history we ve been enduring the longest recession in us history ever since the dot com bust the above chart shows the gdp growth rate and the real gdp growth rate which has actually been contraction not growth for the past two decades if measured by historic standards so long as gdp is growing above 0 on the chart above we re in expansion whenever gdp is shrinking below 0 on the chart above we re in recession so when you see financial commentators writing or talking about the longest expansion on record this month translate that in light of this article it is only the longest expansion on record if you change the way you calculate gdp from the way previous records were calculated it s sort of like saying this person ran the longest marathon in history but not memtion that we ve reduced the length of the kilometer or mile by which we measure marathons the government and the fed love to cook the books they do it under the guise that old numbers really were not all that accurate but if that were truly the reason why is it the corrections and adjustments always serve to make the present regime s numbers look better perhaps people doing the calculations in the past were willing to be more conservative in terms of how much they patted themselves on the back for how well they were doing now you know why it doesn t feel like things have really gotten any better for the average person they haven t we ve been living the last twenty years in a trickle down recession that has only benefited the top 10 mostly of course the 1 one would think we might have gotten a little extra lift in gdp percentage wise for massive amount of extra debt we took on it s not just the government that saddled itself with a shipload of extra debt corporations did the same and total individual debt is deeper now than before the official great recession hit per capita consumer debt may not be deeper since the population has grown massively through immigration but i ve not been quoting per capita gdp here either for all that debt we have seen less gdp improvement even by the official numbers than at any time in the past hundred years but it gets worse than that because we re very proud right now of also attaining the lowest unemployment rate in history so let s take a look at that number too employment in statistics is a good profession the main people assuring themselves of future employment are the statistic manipulators they are kept well busy unemployment only appears to be at its lowest ever but unemployment truthfully remains quite bad you see most people fell off the unemployment charts years ago during this expansion because their unemployed was expanded for so long that they got lost the financial reporters have forgotten about that though most of them never noticed it in the first place but i wrote about this statistical manipulation here for years at the beginning of the great recession until i just got tired of saying it falling out of the official statistics happens in three main ways 1 you only remain counted in unemployment stats for as long as you keep actively seeking work and qualifying for benefits period multitudes gave up seeking work years ago and chose earlier retirement or death or the stats stopped counting them when they for whatever reasons stopped looking for work 2 you also fall off the list as soon as you use up all your available benefits because that is another way to no longer qualify millions used up all of their available benefits years ago 3 you fall off the list when you replace your former full time job with part time work as a result we have the lowest labor participation rate in half a century even the fed acknowledges that and pretends to be mystified as to why that is when it is as obvious as the gray hair on the fed chair s head all of that makes it easy to have an outstanding looking unemployment number that really is not representative at all of our labor situation real unemployment factoring all of that back in looks like the top line in the graph below the bottom two lines are the official measures of unemployment used by the us government and the federal reserve shadowstats the number of new jobs you keep hearing about is equally bogus and i ve pointed that out many times in the past too now however as we crack open the champagne to celebrate the longest expansion in history is a good time for a refresher on that we count part time jobs as full time jobs when we tally new jobs but most of the new jobs created during this expansion were either part time jobs that replaced full time jobs or were jobs that offered lower pay or lower benefits in fact the number of part time jobs in the economy is now 40 higher than it was the last time unemployment was this low and those jobs typically don t come with benefits and typically pay lower wages but it gets worse besides not counting new jobs in full time equivalents all of those new jobs are assumed to be additional people hired back into the labor force but many were actually the same people counted twice that is because they were people who went from holding one good full time job to holding two part time jobs in order to make ends meet both of which offer no benefits and lower pay for each hour worked so do you have to even wonder why it is we ve seen the middle class deteriorate substantially during this great expansion we ve simply buried the truth in statistical smoke and mirrors real wages have not gone up at all so workers got no participation in the expansion it all went to corporate owners and with less disposable income workers certainly were not in a position to be investing in corporate ownership other than in their retirement funds so maybe they benefited some there between the dot com bust and the great recession however most laborers have barely made up for all that they lost in stock market excesses that were stripped away if the present stock bubble bursts they could easily wind up behind where they were two decades ago in real dollars stocks are way overpriced based on their cape average which is probably the most historically accurate and meaningful average out there so yes it s a bubble many people are only willing to acknowledge bubbles after they burst but i m here to pop your bubble now all trumped up about nothing surely things have gotten better since trump entered office right according to the congressional research services may 2019 report about the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act a k a the trump tax cuts this analysis examines the preliminary effects of the act during the first year 2018 on the whole the growth effects tend to show a relatively small if any first year effect on the economy although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut s effects on gdp they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run although investment grew significantly the growth patterns for different types of assets do not appear to be consistent with the direction and size of the supply side incentive effects one would expect from the tax changes this potential outcome may raise questions about how much longer run growth will result from the tax revision real wages grew more slowly than gdp at 2 0 adjusted by the gdp deflator compared with 2 9 for overall real gdp such slower growth has occurred in the past the real wage rate for production and nonsupervisory workers grew by 1 2 while evidence does indicate significant repurchases of shares either from tax cuts or repatriated revenues relatively little was directed to paying worker bonuses which had been announced by some firms according to the national income and product accounts nipa actual growth rate was 2 9 which is consistent with a small effect of the tax revision perhaps even smaller than projected by most analysts the data appear to indicate that not enough growth occurred in the first year to cause the tax cut to pay for itself crs report but this year will come in better right well let s see the first quarter came in at about the same as that 2 9 but pretty much everyoneanticipates the second quarter is about to come in worse i say substantially worse we shall see if so it means the new tax program has accomplished all it ever will because it was supposed to build in its successes year after year let s hope larry kudlow who helped mastermind the new tax regime gets on the microphone a little more often to talk this puppy into preforming so far not much bang for the buck but hey at least we exploded the national debt out of earthly orbit forever that s something right still lets see how the trickle down trump plan actually panned out for workers distributional analyses of the tax change suggested that the tax revision favored higher income taxpayers in part because most of the tax cut benefited corporations and in part because the individual income tax cut largely went to higher income individuals during the debate about taxes however arguments were made that these corporate tax cuts would benefit workers due to growth in investment and the capital stock in the absence of the tax cuts wages should grow with the economy and wage rates should grow as the capital stock grows in addition tight labor markets resulting from the approach to full employment should have put upward pressure on wage rates in any case evidence from 2018 indicated that labor compensation adjusted to real values by the price indices for personal consumption expenditures grew slower than output in general there is no indication of a surge in wages in 2018 compared to history or relative to gdp growth increased funds whether accessed from abroad or through tax cuts could be used in several ways investment paying down debt increasing wages paying wage bonuses paying dividends or repurchasing shares during the passage of the tax revision and in the immediate aftermath some argued that firms would use these funds to pay worker bonuses as discussed in the previous section on wages subsequently a number of firms announced bonuses which in some cases they attributed to the tax cut one organization that tracks these bonuses has reported a total of 4 4 billion 41 with us employment of 157 million this amount is 28 per worker much of these funds the data indicate has been used for a record breaking amount of stock buybacks with 1 trillion announced by the end of 2018 crs report what it all went to the corporate owners who could have seen that coming i m pretty sure that is precisely how i said two years ago this was going to turn out and people just argued that i m a trump hater not willing to give the plan a chance actually i just hated giving the government a chance to start racking up debt faster than our eyeballs can spin knowing the benefits would all inure to the wealthy therefore as my motto originally stated it s been a great recession for a few that s why i call my site the great recession blog for some it was great let s do it all over again so the good times can keep on rolling for the few and the mighty that of course is exactly what the fed plans to do by diving back toward zero interest rates all over again therefore to keep up with the times i recently upgraded my motto to motto 2 0 for the great recession 2 0 it was such a great recession we re heading back for more liked it take a second to support david haggith on patreon david haggith digg this article published monday 15 july 2019 e mail

i was raised in a company house in a company town where the miners had to buy their own oilers that is rubber coveralls drill bits and other tools at the company store that company inco limited the world s leading producer of nickel for most of the 20th century controlled the town of sudbury ontario but never succeeded in owning the souls of the men and women who lived and worked there that s because these were union men and women self possessed a little rowdy and well aware that puny pleas from individual workers fall on deaf corporate ears as i prepare to retire in a couple of days 54 years after starting work as a copper puncher at the inco smelter the relationship between massive multinational corporations and workers is different unions represent a much smaller percentage of workers now so few that some don t even know what a labor organization is or what organized labor can accomplish that is the result of deliberate decades long attacks on unions by corporations and the rich they intend to own not only workers time and production but their very souls i d like to tell you the story of inco because it illustrates the arc of labor union ascendance and attenuation over the past 72 years since i was born in sudbury when i was a boy the inco workers about 19 000 of them were represented by the international union of mine mill and smelter workers the union was gathering strength my dad wilfred gerard was among the rabble rousers we lived just a few miles from the mine and workers would gather at the house someone would bring a case of beer and my mom would make egg salad or bologna sandwiches conditions in the mine were terrible and these workers were organizing to achieve change i recall them talking about a work stoppage over safety glasses i was amazed that they would have to take action like that to get essential work equipment the company i thought should voluntarily take this simple step to ensure workers were not unnecessarily injured on the job i learned two important lessons from sitting on the steps and listening to those meetings one was that the company would do nothing for the workers unless forced by collective action the other was that labor unions were instruments of both economic and social justice i started work in the smelter at age 18 after graduating high school my mother told my girlfriend susan my future wife not to let me get involved in the union because if i did i would be gone all of the time for a few years i resisted union activism still i carried a copy of the labor contract in my pocket pulled out just high enough so the boss could see it i knew what it said and i wanted him to know i knew in 1967 when i was 20 the international union of mine mill and smelter workers merged with the united steelworkers usw and i became a usw member it didn t take long for the guys at the smelter to see that i had a big mouth and in 1969 they petitioned for me to become a shop steward that was the beginning my mom was right it did mean i was gone much of the time i got myself demoted so i could work day shifts and attend college at night on day shift i noticed the company was using a bunch of contractors many were performing work that was supposed to be done by union members other contractors sat in their trucks parked behind the warehouse doing nothing so i got about six guys to help me track and record the violations every day then we would file grievances against the company we could not win because the contract language was weak at that point but we took it through all the stages of grieving and it cost inco money that made the bosses furious so they took it out on me you have to be prepared for that if you are going to be an activist they made me rake rocks that had fallen off the mine trucks onto the road they made me pick up trash in the parking lot they tried to humiliate me but i always found a way to comply without bowing to them the advantage we had in those days was that they thought they were smarter than us they didn t understand that we were a team and we stuck together so there was no way they were going to own us that was the 1960s a different time union membership in the united states rose through 1965 when nearly one in three workers belonged in canada the rise continued through 1985 when the rate was 38 percent the drop off in the united states was fairly slow until 1980 when it plummeted to 23 2 percent it has now fallen to 10 5 percent in canada the decline was steady but much slower the rate there remains 30 1 percent close to the all time high in the united states the difference is that in the united states corporations and conservatives engaged in a successful campaign beginning in 1971 to seize power from workers and propagandize for what they euphemistically called free enterprise really it s cutthroat capitalism the upshot is that u s workers have more difficulty forming unions than canadians and u s corporations can more easily lock workers out of their jobs and hire strikebreakers the intent is to enable corporations to own their workers lock stock and soul lewis powell the late u s supreme court justice launched this drive to crush labor the left and environmentalists in the united states with a memo he wrote in 1971 for the u s chamber of commerce and distributed to corporate leaders powell told the chamber that it had to organize businesses into a political force because he claimed corporations and the free market system were under broad attack and in deep trouble he inveighed against regulations sought by car safety activist ralph nader by environmentalists petitioning for clean air and water and by unions demanding less deadly mines and manufacturing he castigated those on the left pursuing a fairer safer and more humane society businesses must cultivate political power and wield it powell said to secure free market advantages such as tax breaks and loopholes specifically for corporations and the rich powell also told the chamber strength lies in organization in careful long range planning and implementation in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years in the scale of financing available only through joint effort and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations that is exactly what the chamber achieved it catalyzed a business movement funded by wealthy conservative family and corporate foundations including those of coors olin scaife and koch to name a few the foundations sponsored conservative professors at universities and right wing non profits such as the heritage foundation the cato institute americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec which provides junkets for right wing lawmakers at which it encourages them to champion anti union and anti worker legislation these groups bankrolled conservative candidates and secured appointments of conservative judges between the end of world war ii and 1970 during the rise of unions workers incomes rose with productivity income inequality declined and north america became home to the largest middle class in history after 1970 and the chamber effort to implement the powell manifesto unions declined and workers wages stagnated virtually all new income and profits went to ceos stockholders and the already rich the middle class dwindled as income inequality rose to gilded age levels this occurred at the same time that corporations expanded becoming massive multinationals with facilities sprawled across the world and without allegiance to any country this happened to inco vale a brazilian corporation bought it in 2006 and now vale is a true multinational with facilities worldwide multinationals spurned their obligation to serve workers consumers communities and shareholders instead they focused only on shareholders the rest be damned they closed factories in the united states and canada and moved them to places like mexico and china with low wages and lax environmental laws they exploited foreign workers and destroyed north american workers lives and communities as far back as the 1970s the usw the afl cio as well as the textile shoe steel and other industry leaders warned congress about what this trend combined with increasing imports meant for american workers and their neighborhoods in 1973 after the united states experienced its first two years of trade deficits in a century i w abel then president of the usw urged congress to slow the massive flood of imports that are sweeping away jobs and industries in wholesale lots congress failure to heed this alarm resulted in the collapse of the u s textile and shoe industries and many others it very nearly killed the steel industry which has suffered tsunami after tsunami of bankruptcies gunpoint mergers and mill closures tens of thousands of family supporting jobs were lost and communities across both the united states and canada hollowed out in 1971 and 1972 the trade deficit totaled 8 4 billion last year it was 621 billion every imported toy shoe bolt of cloth and ingot of steel means fewer u s factories and jobs and more struggling towns the usw presidents who followed abel lloyd mcbride and lynn r williams escalated the battle against offshored factories and unfairly traded imports the usw even filed suit to try to stop the north american free trade agreement nafta because williams like independent presidential candidate ross perot saw that it would suck canadian and u s factories and jobs south of the mexican border a sticker created by the usw to use on posters and billboards internationally during the strike courtesy of united steelworkers the late usw president george becker and i agitated for change confronting and cajoling presidents and prime ministers and members of congress and parliament the usw martialed all of its forces including activists in its women of steel and nextgen programs the steelworkers organization of active retirees and its rapid response coordinators tens of thousands of workers rallied camped out in washington d c harangued lawmakers and sent postcards working with allies in the community such as environmental and human rights groups faith and food safety organizations together we have won some short term relief measures these include the tariffs on imported steel and aluminum imposed last year and the defeat of the proposed new trade deal the trans pacific partnership that would have extended nafta problems across pacific rim countries in the decades that the usw battled bad trade i moved through the ranks from staff representative to district director to canadian national director to usw secretary treasurer among my goals was to forge international workers alliances to combat the corporate cabals that always got seats at the table to write the trade deals that worked against workers when i was elected usw president in 2001 one of my top priorities was expanding the union s coalitions now the usw participates in three global unions which together represent more than 82 million workers in more than 150 countries worldwide the usw and partner unions also created more than two dozen global councils of workers including those for workers at arcelormittal basf bridgestone dowdupont and gerdau these employers quickly learned that taking on workers at one factory meant taking on workers at all of their workplaces internationally in 2005 the usw and the mexican miners union known as los mineros formed a strategic alliance and the usw gave los mineros general secretary napoleon gomez sanctuary in canada when he was unjustly accused of wrongdoing by a mexican government intent on shutting him up after a mine disaster in 2008 the usw joined with unite the union the second largest union in the uk and ireland forming workers uniting to fight exploitation and injustice globally and the usw formed alliances with union federations in australia and brazil where the organization is known as the cut this international brotherhood and sisterhood stood with canadian mine and smelter workers for a year beginning in july 2009 during its first negotiations with the usw vale the brazilian corporation that bought inco demanded harsh concessions from its thousands of canadian workers though vale was highly profitable it said it wouldn t even bargain with the usw unless the workers first accepted the cuts that forced them out on strike i started talking regularly with the head of the cut in brazil to strategize and plan joint actions brazilian workers and community groups wholeheartedly supported their canadian brothers and sisters they demonstrated in front of the vale headquarters and threw red paint symbolizing blood on the building they shut down traffic with all sorts of street actions they protested at the vale shareholders meeting inside and out they also traveled to canada in force with flags for a rally in sudbury in march of 2010 when the strike was eight months old and banks were repossessing some workers cars and foreclosing on homes by then vale had 100 000 workers in mines and smelters across the world supporters from many of those communities in asia africa europe and australia joined thousands of canadians who marched through the streets that cold day vale could see that its canadian workers in sudbury port colborne and voisey s bay were not alone they had allies from around the world willing to stand up to the giant multinational the strike ended 12 long months after it started we didn t get everything we wanted but we certainly didn t accept vale s concessionary demands vale failed to accomplish its mission which was to spread to all of its operations worldwide the authoritarian top down nasty management practices that it had honed in brazil the proof of that is the next round of negotiations with vale went fairly well and we got an honorable settlement now for labor to secure gains in the united states or canada or anywhere workers must mobilize we have to bring everyone together women men poor people people of color gay people all working people none of us is big enough or developed enough to win this fight alone if we fight together i can t guarantee we will win but if we don t fight for justice i can guarantee we will lose since none of us is willing to owe our souls to the company store we re going to have to find ways to continue building coalitions robust enough to confront capital and win the battle for economic and social justice
michael hicks the past decade has seen a blossoming of research on the geography of employment and the effect of automation on the demand for workers and skills these studies benefited from significantly richer data sets on people and skills that enabled substantially more sophisticated labor market analysis i especially admire work done by david autor and enrico moretti whose work is rich and easily accessible to non economists their research was promoted by real world happenings that could ultimately inform public policy but i have become frustrated at how few insights from the past quarter century are understood and applied to education and tax policies in many states and certainly here in indiana public policy towards education tax incentives and the role of workforce training seem very focused on applying lessons from the 1960s and 1970s while ignoring nearly everything important from the 1980s through the present this column is part of my effort to draw out two or three critical lessons from the last two or three decades and tie them to state policies the first lesson learned is the primacy of human capital in the success of regions nearly the only thing that differs among cities counties or metro areas are the educational attainment of workers capital investment which for much of the 19th and early 20th century helped determine economic differences between regions matters very little today sadly indiana seems wedded to a 1960s model of capital investment adjusting for inflation since 2010 indiana increased tax incentives for capital by 5 025 million over the same time our cumulative increase in education funding to universities and k 12 education was only 17 million indiana s leaders pay a lot of lip service to educating and attracting talented workers but pay a whole lot of money to attract capital more from michael hicks erasing college debt is an astonishingly bad idea the second lesson of this new research is the growing polarization of labor markets this means there has been growth at both the high and low ends of the pay scale this has come at the expense of middle skilled jobs that pay mid level wages the proximal cause of this is technological change the skills most susceptible to automation and digitization have been those clustered within the middle class foreign trade also influenced these jobs but mostly because trade pressure simply hastened the speed with which american firms adopted new technologies and automation state level policies appear oblivious to the polarization of jobs it is hard to overstate how unmindful indiana s policies are to three decades of evidence as labor markets polarized wages rose sharply at the top and stagnated at the bottom one very likely reason is that displaced workers flooded low skilled labor markets while the supply of highly skilled workers remained low in response to polarized labor markets and low levels of college attendance indiana cut funding to colleges and universities this quickly reduced the share of hoosier children heading to college at a time when the college wage premiums continues to rise this is puzzling in light of abundant evidence that more cognitive skills are in greater demand the third great lesson of labor market research is uncertainty about the composition of future jobs and labor market skills we know with much certainty that automation will replace many skills now prized by labor markets history tells us there will be plenty new jobs but they will require different typically more cognitive skills and will appear in different places this uncertainty combined with labor market turbulence makes clear a need for greater focus on durable transferable highly cognitive skills in short we need more of the skills taught almost exclusively in elementary middle and high schools then in colleges and universities in response to labor market turbulence and a greater demand for durable cognitive skills indiana has moved in precisely the wrong direction the state weakened high school graduation requirements and now obliges children to substitute academic learning for career familiarization as early as middle school we have shifted funding from schools to workforce training substituting learning in durable cognitive skills with inherently transient job focused training good schools are probably working around these obstacles but taxpayers should ask tough questions of state leaders who send this message to send to students and families these critiques of indiana s human capital policies are not new the evidence of labor market polarization and the importance of human capital in local prosperity is not new concern over indiana s poor levels of educational attainment are not new perhaps the only novelty here is that since 2010 indiana has cut spending on k 12 from 2 59 percent to 2 29 percent of our state s gdp we have made even deeper cuts to the share of gdp supporting higher education i admire fiscal restraint but that is not what we are observing state and local incentives to businesses have grown by more than 5 billion since 2010 the shift of tax dollars from investment in human capital to subsidies for business equipment is most assuredly not a conservative principle more to the point we hear a great deal of political talk about the need for talent but it is difficult to reconcile that rhetoric with spending priorities if today we spent the same share of gdp on education as we did in 2010 we would have more than 1 56 billion extra this year alone i am not advocating for a large tax increase but it is essential that we be honest with ourselves we are spending far less of our income on human capital and more on physical capital than we did a decade ago i suspect there are good political reasons for this shift but it is deeply misguided economic policy it is now time for taxpayers and voters to help align successful politics with smarter economic policy michael hicks is the george and frances ball distinguished professor of economics and the director of the center for business and economic research at ball state university

growth took place during the obama administration trump claims the economy is the best it has ever been that s inaccurate the economy is growing at roughly 3 2 percent but in the 1990 s the economy

volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt what jumps out from the current economic situation is the fact that trump has broken his pre election promises to american workers writing in common dreams economist robert reich detailed the 7 biggest failures of trumponomics views 2019 06 11 7 biggest failures trumponomics promised to boost the wages of american workers including a 4000 pay raise for the average american family instead wages for most american have been flat adjusted for inflation over the same period corporate profits have soared and the rich have become far richer reich noted that trump promised a tax cut for middle class families but instead this tax cut disproportionately benefited the rich on july 10th federal reserve chair jerome powell appeared before congress and noted mixed trends in the economy the u s jobs market remains robust and consumer spending appears set to rebound however business investment has slowed considerably along with housing investment and manufacturing output powell continued our baseline outlook is for economic growth to remain solid labor markets to stay strong and inflation to move back up over time to the committee s 2 percent objective however uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months in particular economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies there are storm crowds on the economic horizon many are trump s fault in august september the u s hits the debt limit forbes magazine teresaghilarducci 2019 04 25 the u s debt ceiling expired on march 1 and nobody cared but they will 57842bff6b3f explains when the limit is reached the u s treasury can t borrow any more severely impacting the real economy for fear the government would default on our debt interest rates already one of the fastest rising costs in the federal budget will rise as the political crisis builds because foreign borrowers will demand an additional risk premium and rising interest rates will impact u s treasuries mortgages credit cards car loans student debt and corporate debt if workers households students and corporations can t pay their bills because of the interest rate shocks the economy could go into recession during that same time frame the government runs out of money as republicans have been unable to pass a new appropriations bill many observers are concerned about trump s trade policies robert reich noted trump promised to bring down america s trade deficit as fast as possible instead the trade deficit has hit an all time high reich continued trump s trade wars have hammered rural america farm incomes are down 12bn in the first quarter of this year according to the department of agriculture farm bankruptcies are at near record levels trump s trade policy is emblematic of the problems created by his america first foreign policy in many decisions for example pulling out of the iran nuclear treaty the jcpoa and the paris climate change agreement trump acted without support from our allies recently when it appeared that the u s would attack iran after it shot down one of our drones trump seemed ready to launch major military action without support of our allies trump s unilateralism has economic consequences information security pandemics and climate change it s been well documented but denied by the trump administration that the united states is under continuous cyberattack by russia what s gotten less press is the reality that american industry is under attack from china north korea and iran as well as russia trump is doing nothing to thwart this there s a real possibility of devastating damage to america s energy and financial infrastructure international cooperation is required to respond to the threat of pandemics but donald trump is a unilateralist and germaphobe and therefore unlikely to respond effectively to a global health challenge finally there s the issue of global climate change trump doesn t believe it is happening and has chosen to ignore the mounting evidence as i write this a massive storm is battering louisiana here in northern california climate change in the form of floods and wildfires has already affected our economy in some counties housing loss has affected the tax base and overall there s been a massive infrastructure hit we re 16 months away from the 2020 presidential election it s likely that the u s economy will weaken trump will be responsible his approval rating will decline bob burnett is a berkeley writer and activist he

the announcements come just months ahead of the presidential elections slated for 27 october as the chances of sitting centre right president mauricio macri to get re elected still appear bleak former president cristina fernandez de kirchner who is a running mate to centre left candidate alberto fernandez is vowing to fix argentina s economy with an updated version of her policies known as kirchnerismo the centre left tandem of kirchner and fernandez the two are not related based their economic agenda off the economic nationalism and a stiff opposition to international financial institutions which some believe helped rebuild the argentine economy in the early 2010s the objectives that were set at the time of granting the loan have been absolutely distorted alberto fernandez says public debt increased as did inflation unemployment and poverty while gdp fell by 5 8 percent at the end of the first quarter of this year it is more than evident how far argentina is from starting to grow if this path is followed however macri enjoys warm ties with us president donald trump and his business friendly agenda is viewed favourably by international investors despite the argentine economy being in a recession since last year yet despite praising macri international credit rating agencies are still warning investors against doing business in argentina the nation s gdp contracted by 4 7 per cent at the height of the currency crisis in 2q18 after which the recession has become midler with the argentine economy shrinking by 0 2 per cent in 1q19 still the fernandez kirchner alliance is leading macri 42 5 to 34 5 per cent as of last month the fund s 57 billion assistance programme for argentine has several policy conditions attached to it which include cuts to public spending kirchner argues macri s austerity measures have impaired the purchasing power of argentine households and undermined business revenues additionally the declining quality of life and a drop in effective consumer demand have failed to translate into a lower inflation which is still riding high at 57 3 per cent as of may argentina should stop trusting neo liberal theories and realise what happens when neo liberals take over fernandez said taking direct aim at macri as his open market policies however officials in buenos aires say the argentine economy has shown signs of improvement this year not least due to the massive aid from the imf and world bank the macri cabinet however fell short of explaining how argentina will pay back its debt over the years if not decades to come when argentine leaders sought help from the imf last year christine lagarde s message to them was clear you ve got a friend in me now she s leaving the indebted country faces an uncertain future bloomberg business july 5 2019 last week argentina posted a 710 9 million surplus in the first half of this year outpacing even the imf s projections the fund praised the macri government following the announcement while it has taken time these policy efforts are starting to bear fruit the imf said financial markets have stabilised the fiscal and external positions are improving and the economy is beginning a gradual recovery from last year s recession the fund is strongly supportive of these important policy efforts argentine authorities have made commendable efforts that will help expand coverage of the social safety net and help improve gender equality by expanding the social spending floor to incorporate assistance programs pic twitter com 8wf89d2y6f imf imfnews july 13 2019 the fernandez duo however remains highly critical of the imf assistance programme alberto fernandez believes the conditions of the stand by agreement were unfavourable for argentine and said he would renegotiate the deal after getting elected in october meanwhile macri has reaffirmed his commitment to working with the imf and world bank to achieve a greater integration of argentine into the global system of trading relations
shortly before greece s recent election the gifted orator and then prime minister alexis tsipras delivered a rousing speech to a cheering throng of supporters at one point declaring that his main opponent could not achieve what tsipras was experiencing at that moment an adoring crowd they can t have a rally like this one he said they can t experience the true love of simple people well it turns out that greeks may no longer be interested in the fist pumping politician with a bag full of promises instead when greeks went to the polls last week they discarded the charismatic tsipras and his leftist syriza party in favor of the decidedly uncharismatic technocratic center right leader of the new democracy party kyriakos mitsotakis the harvard educated former mckinsey consultant was likely more at home delivering a powerpoint presentation than a rip roaring speech but greeks were in a problem solving mood looking for solutions to their problem of diminishing incomes diminishing jobs diminishing wages and diminishing hope maybe a boring technocrat is what they need after all that and the bracing effect of further investments from new partners like those in the middle east particularly ones with expertise in real estate and tourism development such as companies to be found in dubai and abu dhabi greece has experienced a lost decade since the global financial crisis of 2008 9 triggered its own debt crisis it has lost about a quarter of its economic output faced debilitating unemployment stagnant and falling wages crumbling public services and a major exodus of the best and the brightest meanwhile a nearly 300 billion rescue package put together by the european union and the international monetary fund came laden with demands for austerity and government job cuts the austerity cycle sent greece spiraling downward when tsipras won the premiership in 2015 he faced an unpalatable choice play ball with the eu and the imf or go bankrupt tsipras was no flame thrower initial impressions notwithstanding he chose to play ball however reluctantly but he did not inspire business confidence and the austerity cycle spun onward the new prime minister mitsotakis has promised deep reforms tax cuts job creation and the privatization of services and whatever he is he is a man of his word in 2012 as a minister he was given the unenviable task of leading eu mandated job cuts as a result of an earlier bailout with little support from political allies he made the cuts but when all is said the fate of greece should not only be an eu concern a thriving greece could boost arab mediterranean sea economies from morocco to lebanon here is where surplus economies like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates come in investments in greece should be seen as investments in the mediterranean region in fact the mediterranean red sea indian ocean economic corridor should be considered rightly as one of the arab world s most vital trade routes touching countries from north africa to east africa to the arabian peninsula in addition greece can be an important staging post based on the country s local knowledge of the balkan region for middle east investors planning deeper forays into that part of central and eastern europe for now the nearly 500 million mou signed between abu dhabi based mubadala the emirate s second largest sovereign wealth fund with greece s new economy development fund taneo to invest in venture capital funds that specialize in telecommunications it e commerce and biotech is a good start but it s only a start consider what china s cosco did with the port of piraeus the chinese firm had been given a lease to run the port more than a decade ago the flailing port needed a revamp and cosco dramatically turned it around making it the second largest container terminal in the mediterranean and by all accounts a success story the cosco investment shows that there are opportunities for successful investment in greece even amid the hardest of times and along the lines of transportation athens might also want to consider vastly expanding the kind of arrangement it already has with emirates airlines of dubai the carrier flies from dubai to athens picks up more passengers and then flies on to the new york area airport of newark new jersey returning on the same route expanding on such fifth freedom flights with more middle east carriers would not just bring more tourists to greece but allow it to offer north american travelers the kind of service middle east airlines are known for this would constitute a win win and a win again now as the economy flickers to life and a new business friendly prime minister takes the helm new opportunities abound in infrastructure services and of course tourism greece needs more 5 star hotels for instance the eu will continue to play a vital role as greece s backstop and key market but emerging world countries like china the uae and saudi arabia should also play a role as commercial partner and investor the greeks deserve better mitsotakis said in his inaugural speech as prime minister and now is the time for us to prove it for him to achieve his goal and for greece to thrive they will need to attract foreign direct investment far beyond the eu states as a linchpin of the mediterranean region a greek economic renaissance could benefit a broad swathe of arab world economies for that reason arab policymakers should see greece as not just an eu problem but also a mediterranean opportunity afshin molavi is a senior fellow at the foreign policy institute of the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies and editor and founder of the new silk road monitor he contributed this article to the syndication bureau
by david haggith this month the economic expansion brought to you by your federal reserve and by us government largess becomes the longest expansion in the history of the united states that s something right something let s take an honest look at what we now call great by the longest expansion we mean the longest period in which us gdp has been growing without a recession now that s something to crow about right not so fast for many reasons it s also been the most anemic expansion on the books and it s not too hard to see why it s been the longest having nothing at all to do with a great economy it has cost us far more than any expansion by an order of magnitude because we ve piled up ten times the national debt over any amount we accumulated during previous expansions i ve said before it s easy to let the good times roll when you are buying it all on the company credit card we also quadrupled the size of the size of the fed s balance sheet that didn t cost anything but we sure didn t get much bang for the buck we actually got less bang than in any previous expansion the permanent recession sure we got outstanding growth in stocks but growth in business revenue has been pathetic growth in corporate development has been even worse i e new plants improved productivity etc growth in earnings was decent except for the fact that it is entirely a feint because it was created mostly by reducing the numbers of outstanding shares over which earnings are divided not so much by growing business why do you think wall street prefers to talk about earnings per share eps instead of just actual profits we can pretend the strength in eps was because business has been booming during the long economic expansion but it wasn t we got less production growth out of this expansion than in any other expansion in us history and that is easy to prove with the fed s own data gdp went up but the rate of growth in gdp has been in secular decline during each expansion expansion periods are the periods between the gray recession zones in the fed graph below of course those are percentage changes and the higher any number gets the harder it becomes to get as big of a percentage change off that number so not so horrible right well the real numbers look worse because you see the government has changed the way it calculates gdp over the years to make things look better when measured against history if you go back to tracking gdp the way it was historically calculated if for no other reason than to keep the formula being used consistent across the chart it looks like this top line in the chart below is the line from the fed chart above bottom line is what you get if you stay with the same formula throughout the chart oops worse than pathetic using consistent accounting through time we discover we have actually been in receding gdp recession since 2000 with the exception of one little bump in 2004 we don t want to admit that so we we ll just ignore that by saying we improved our accounting methods over time and that is why i say it s been a great recession because we never actually left the great recession rather than the longest expansion in us history we ve been enduring the longest recession in us history ever since the dot com bust the above chart shows the gdp growth rate and the real gdp growth rate which has actually been contraction not growth for the past two decades if measured by historic standards so long as gdp is growing above 0 on the chart above we re in expansion whenever gdp is shrinking below 0 on the chart above we re in recession so when you see financial commentators writing or talking about the longest expansion on record this month translate that in light of this article it is only the longest expansion on record ifyou change the way you calculate gdp from the way previous records were calculated it s sort of like saying this person ran the longest marathon in history but not memtion that we ve reduced the length of the kilometer or mile by which we measure marathons the government and the fed love to cook the books they do it under the guise that old numbers really were not all that accurate but if that were truly the reason why is it the corrections and adjustments always serve to make the present regime s numbers look better perhaps people doing the calculations in the past were willing to be more conservative in terms of how much they patted themselves on the back for how well they were doing now you know why it doesn t feel like things have really gotten any better for the average person they haven t we ve been living the last twenty years in a trickle down recession that has only benefited the top 10 mostly of course the 1 one would think we might have gotten a little extra lift in gdp percentage wise for massive amount of extra debt we took on it s not just the government that saddled itself with a shipload of extra debt corporations did the same and total individual debt is deeper now than before the official great recession hit per capita consumer debt may not be deeper since the population has grown massively through immigration but i ve not been quoting per capita gdp here either for all that debt we have seen less gdp improvement even by the official numbers than at any time in the past hundred years but it gets worse than that because we re very proud right now of also attaining the lowest unemployment rate in history so let s take a look at that number too employment in statistics is a good profession the main people assuring themselves of future employment are the statistic manipulators they are kept well busy unemployment only appears to be at its lowest ever but unemployment truthfully remains quite bad you see most people fell off the unemployment charts years ago during this expansion because their unemployed was expanded for so long that they got lost the financial reporters have forgotten about that though most of them never noticed it in the first place but i wrote about this statistical manipulation here for years at the beginning of the great recession until i just got tired of saying it falling out of the official statistics happens in three main ways 1 you only remain counted in unemployment stats for as long as you keep actively seeking work and qualifying for benefits period multitudes gave up seeking work years ago and chose earlier retirement or death or the stats stopped counting them when they for whatever reasons stopped looking for work 2 you also fall off the list as soon as you use up all your available benefits because that is another way to no longer qualify millions used up all of their available benefits years ago 3 you fall off the list when you replace your former full time job with part time work we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us as a result we have the lowest labor participation rate in half a century even the fed acknowledges that and pretends to be mystified as to why that is when it is as obvious as the gray hair on the fed chair s head all of that makes it easy to have an outstanding looking unemployment number that really is not representative at all of our labor situation real unemployment factoring all of that back in looks like the top line in the graph below the bottom two lines are the official measures of unemployment used by the us government and the federal reserve the number of new jobs you keep hearing about is equally bogus and i ve pointed that out many times in the past too now however as we crack open the champagne to celebrate the longest expansion in history is a good time for a refresher on that we count part time jobs as full time jobs when we tally new jobs but most of the new jobs created during this expansion were either part time jobs that replaced full time jobs or were jobs that offered lower pay or lower benefits in fact the number of part time jobs in the economy is now 40 higher than it was the last time unemployment was this low and those jobs typically don t come with benefits and typically pay lower wages but it gets worse besides not counting new jobs in full time equivalents all of those new jobs are assumed to be additional people hired back into the labor force but many were actually the same people counted twice that is because they were people who went from holding one good full time job to holding two part time jobs in order to make ends meet both of which offer no benefits and lower pay for each hour worked so do you have to even wonder why it is we ve seen the middle class deteriorate substantially during this great expansion we ve simply buried the truth in statistical smoke and mirrors real wages have not gone up at all so workers got no participation in the expansion it all went to corporate owners and with less disposable income workers certainly were not in a position to be investing in corporate ownership other than in their retirement funds so maybe they benefited some there between the dot com bust and the great recession however most laborers have barely made up for all that they lost in stock market excesses that were stripped away if the present stock bubble bursts they could easily wind up behind where they were two decades ago in real dollars stocks are way overpriced based on their cape average which is probably the most historically accurate and meaningful average out there so yes it s a bubble many people are only willing to acknowledge bubbles after they burst but i m here to pop your bubble now all trumped up about nothing surely things have gotten better since trump entered office right according to the congressional research services may 2019 report about the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act a k a the trump tax cuts this analysis examines the preliminary effects of the act during the first year 2018 on the whole the growth effects tend to show a relatively small if any first year effect on the economy although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut s effects on gdp they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run although investment grew significantly the growth patterns for different types of assets do not appear to be consistent with the direction and size of the supply side incentive effects one would expect from the tax changes this potential outcome may raise questions about how much longer run growth will result from the tax revision real wages grew more slowly than gdp at 2 0 adjusted by the gdp deflator compared with 2 9 for overall real gdp such slower growth has occurred in the past the real wage rate for production and nonsupervisory workers grew by 1 2 while evidence does indicate significant repurchases of shares either from tax cuts or repatriated revenues relatively little was directed to paying worker bonuses which had been announced by some firms according to the national income and product accounts nipa actual growth rate was 2 9 which is consistent with a small effect of the tax revision perhaps even smaller than projected by most analysts the data appear to indicate that not enough growth occurred in the first year to cause the tax cut to pay for itself crs report but this year will come in better right well let s see the first quarter came in at about the same as that 2 9 but pretty much everyone anticipates the second quarter is about to come in worse i say substantially worse we shall see if so it means the new tax program has accomplished all it ever will because it was supposed to build in its successes year after year let s hope larry kudlow who helped mastermind the new tax regime gets on the microphone a little more often to talk this puppy into preforming so far not much bang for the buck but hey at least we exploded the national debt out of earthly orbit forever that s something right still lets see how the trickle down trump plan actually panned out for workers distributional analyses of the tax change suggested that the tax revision favored higher income taxpayers in part because most of the tax cut benefited corporations and in part because the individual income tax cut largely went to higher income individuals during the debate about taxes however arguments were made that these corporate tax cuts would benefit workers due to growth in investment and the capital stock in the absence of the tax cuts wages should grow with the economy and wage rates should grow as the capital stock grows in addition tight labor markets resulting from the approach to full employment should have put upward pressure on wage rates in any case evidence from 2018 indicated that labor compensation adjusted to real values by the price indices for personal consumption expenditures grew slower than output in general there is no indication of a surge in wages in 2018 compared to history or relative to gdp growth increased funds whether accessed from abroad or through tax cuts could be used in several ways investment paying down debt increasing wages paying wage bonuses paying dividends or repurchasing shares during the passage of the tax revision and in the immediate aftermath some argued that firms would use these funds to pay worker bonuses as discussed in the previous section on wages subsequently a number of firms announced bonuses which in some cases they attributed to the tax cut one organization that tracks these bonuses has reported a total of 4 4 billion 41 with us employment of 157 million this amount is 28 per worker much of these funds the data indicate has been used for a record breaking amount of stock buybacks with 1 trillion announced by the end of 2018 crs report what it all went to the corporate owners who could have seen that coming i m pretty sure that is precisely how i said two years ago this was going to turn out and people just argued that i m a trump hater not willing to give the plan a chance actually i just hated giving the government a chance to start racking up debt faster than our eyeballs can spin knowing the benefits would all inure to the wealthy therefore as my motto originally stated it s been a great recession for a few that s why i call my site the great recession blog for some it was great let s do it all over again so the good times can keep on rolling for the few and the mighty that of course is exactly what the fed plans to do by diving back toward zero interest rates all over again therefore to keep up with the times i recently upgraded my motto to motto 2 0 for the great recession 2 0 it was such a great recession we re heading back for more
guest jeff chidester what would you do if someone came knocking on your door and demanded that you pay them 291 000 worse still what if this same person said that based on the average count of u s households your family actually owes 748 000 naturally you would think absurd right sadly you would be wrong and as ridiculous as it may seem you and every american are on the hook for trillions of dollars of our national debt first let s dispel a major misconception about the amount of debt we owe as a nation you will hear the number 21 trillion dollars bandied about which is only a fraction of our national obligation according to u s department of the treasury as of the end of 2018 the federal government had a combined total of 95 410 000 000 000 in unfunded obligations liabilities and debts just in case you lost your place counting all of those zeros that is 95 4 trillion the u s department of commerce bureau of economic analysis indicates our combined liability is almost five times the size of the u s economy while also reporting that our debt is 27 times larger than the annual federal revenues taxes and fees according to the board of governors of the federal reserve system our national debt of 95 4 trillion dollars also represents the combined net worth of 88 of all u s households and nonprofit organizations assets real estate corporate stocks private business savings and durable goods however it is far worse than you may realize as bad as 94 trillion may sound that amount does not include social security and medicare which we believe to be guaranteed but not really in the early 1960s the supreme court ruled that social security is not insurance or property flemming vs nestor the amount paid is calculated into your benefit total but the laws that govern social security fall to congress and congress can change your benefits any time they want today payments are guaranteed under our current laws but congress can change that so you may be obligated by law to contribute to fica federal insurance contributions act but it does not obligate the government to give you anything back as nice as contribute sounds fica is a tax and congress can decide to keep giving it to you reduce your payments temporary halt your payments or in the case of nestor give you nothing so when you combine 94 trillion with our social security and medicare commitments our total national debt liabilities and unfunded obligations amount is closer to 200 trillion dollars based on data reported in the u s treasury annual reports over the past five years combine that with the billions of unfunded liabilities at the state and local level and we are insolvent broke and deep into the red here is the sad truth most politicians will not be talking about certainly not president trump speaker pelosi senate majority leader mitch mcconnell or any of the major presidential candidates simply put if we took everything away from everyone in america and had one gigantic yard sale in order to service our current debt we would still be short of paying off the debt by several trillion dollars our national debt is so large we can t really fathom its size we can say things like if you started the day jesus christ was born and spent 1 million every day since then you still wouldn t have spent 1 trillion or you could spend one dollar per second and at that rate of spending it would take you over 32 000 years to spend one trillion dollars no matter how we say it it would fall on deaf ears now i know the impulse is to blame tax cuts the republicans or the democrats fine but the fact is that with 200 trillion dollars in various liabilities or more we are to blame you and i we let this happen we are still letting it happen yet we stand in front of the current crop of presidential candidates like the seagulls in the movie finding nemo squawking mine mine mine clueless or indifferent to the economic disaster we currently find ourselves in we certainly have come a long way from ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country slave reparations paying off the current 1 trillion dollars in student college debt universal healthcare universal basic income free daycare free college the green new deal modern monetary theory tax the rich at 70 why not let s just keep printing more money and borrowing from our enemies and just borrow and spend ourselves into prosperity subsidies corporate welfare too big to fail bailouts tariffs quantitative easing and tax cuts without balanced budgets have all contributed to our reckless american economic model place on top of that the irresponsible policies being pushed by the democratic presidential candidates and we just keep doing the same things over and over expecting different results new hampshire is the first in the nation primary state we pick presidents but right now we are allowing the most pressing issue facing our country to go unnoticed instead of asking these candidates about more free stuff maybe we should be asking them what their plan is to fix our current debt crisis jeff chidester was raised in portsmouth and is a lifelong resident of

u s states and cities hand out tens of billions in taxpayer dollars every year to companies as economic incentives these businesses are supposed to use the money typically distributed through economic development programs to open new facilities create jobs and generate tax revenue but all too often that s not what happens as i ve learned after doing research on the use of tax incentives to spur economic development in cities and states across the country particularly in texas recent scandals involving economic development programs in new jersey baltimore and elsewhere illustrate just what s wrong with these programs and why i believe it s time to end this waste of taxpayer dollars once and for all economic development 101 many states counties and cities have economic development agencies tasked with facilitating investment in their communities these agencies undertake a variety of valuable activities from gathering data to training small businesses owners yet one of their most high profile activities is the use of tax and other incentives to entice companies to invest in their communities generating local jobs and expanding the tax base estimates of how much is spent on such incentives range from us 45 billion to 80 billion a year but what do taxpayers get for all this money as it turns out not much 1 a waste of money first off in most cases investments that result from these incentives would have happened anyway that was the case in baltimore involving a federal program meant to spur development in distressed communities it dubbed opportunity zones propublica reported in june that maryland accidentally designated an area of baltimore that wasn t poor and was already under redevelopment an opportunity zone despite catching the error the state kept the designation allowing real estate investors to potentially claim millions of dollars in tax breaks those investors include kevin plank the billionaire ceo of under armour who owns about 40 of the zone according to propublica this example isn t unique last year tim bartik an economist at the upjohn institute for employment research reviewed 30 studies on the use of economic development incentives he found that 75 to 98 of companies were planning to make the desired investment anyway in my own work in texas i found that more than 85 of the companies offered tax breaks had already planned to open the promised new facilities a few even broke ground before applying for the incentives and in new jersey investigators who uncovered abuse in the state s economic development program found that a lawyer representing a powerful democratic official drafted legislation to benefit companies tied to him and his associates to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars their june report described how the new jersey economic development agency didn t perform the basic due diligence of a single google search which would have shown that some of the companies had already announced a move to new jersey before being offered incentives 2 investments rarely pay off even when an incentive does draw new investments they rarely pay off and they can even harm the fiscal health of cities and states by pulling resources away from other more productive activities in incentives to pander a book i co authored with duke political scientist edmund malesky we reviewed the academic literature in the u s and elsewhere on the use of incentives and found that they are expensive and ineffective in generating employment and economic growth wisconsin residents may be learning this the hard way after their government offered electronics manufacturer foxconn over 4 billion in incentives in exchange for a promise to build a high tech facility that is supposed to create 13 000 jobs but since the 2017 announcement the company has failed to meet job targets and even downgraded the type of facility it plans to build 3 a failure of oversight a third problem is that government agencies fail to provide effective oversight to ensure that company promises on investment and employment like foxconn s are upheld a legislative audit found that the wisconsin agency responsible follows problematic oversight practices and failed to verify that companies created the number of jobs or other goals they claimed wisconsin isn t alone many states and municipalities provide limited oversight of the economic incentives they offer and often rely on companies self reported data to determine whether they ve met targets in texas doctoral candidate calvin thrall and i found that the state even allowed companies to renegotiate their job creation targets sometimes the day before they were required to report compliance with an incentive agreement and even though these deals are often accompanied by splashy pr campaigns that highlight how many jobs will be created the incentive contracts often don t even include actual job creation requirements and only 56 of cities surveyed indicated that they required a performance agreement before offering incentives new jersey investigators found similar oversight problems and other shortcomings in its economic development program finally a lack of transparency surrounding these programs makes it hard for others to determine whether taxpayers got what they were promised ending incentives so you re probably wondering if these incentives don t work why do government officials continue to use and promote them the book i wrote with malesky and a related paper showed how these incentives provide a way for politicians to take credit for business investment in the hopes that it will give them a lift in their next election all they have to do is convince voters that these programs work and that the grand promises being made when officials cut ribbons in well publicized ceremonies will eventually pan out powerful special interest groups are also to blame as they play a big role in shaping incentive programs and lobby vigorously for lawmakers to create them and keep them alive rather than reform or rebrand these programs i believe states should take the advice of some of their own evaluations of these programs and eliminate them taxpayers would be better off without them nathan jensen professor of government university of texas at austin

story by ragna gruendler in dublin clare ireland additional content by oliver moore also in ireland on wednesday the 10th of july an estimated 2 500 farmers took to the streets of dublin to protest against the proposed mercosur deal the protest was organised by beef plan a voluntary not for profit organisation set up in october 2018 by a small group of farmers from meath in ireland s centre east since then its membership has grown to over 20 000 so who are they and what do they want on wednesday the 10th of july an estimated 2 500 farmers took to the streets of dublin to protest against the proposed eu mercosur deal the protest was organised by beef plan a voluntary not for profit organisation who was set up in october 2018 by a small group of farmers from meath in ireland s centre east and who has since grown its membership to over 20 000 buses were put on for farmers from all irish counties sponsored by their local businesses and farming co ops to bring farmers up to the dail some left as early as 5am picking up people en route there where about 18 speakers from different farming groups as well as politicians including hugh doyle and eamon corley of beef plan pat mc cormack icmsa geraldine mc nully irish countrywomen assoiciation pippa hackett green party edmund phelan icsa martin kenny sinn fein richard boyd barrett people before profit michael healy rae and michael fitzmaurice td by loading the video you agree to youtube s privacy policy learn more load video always unblock youtube a major concern expressed as of low incomes and an uncertain future for farmers irish livestock sheep and beef farmers are producing at a loss with low incomes and heavy cap reliance 2018 figures suggest profit margins in cattle farming fell 10 from their already low level costs increased by 8 including feed costs rising 31 on cattle rearing farms and by 12 on cattle finishing farms steer prices rose 1 the average income on cattle rearing farms is estimated at 10 200 for 2018 down 19 from 2017 reliance on cap subsidies for beef and sheep is running at or above 100 the sheep and beef sectors have been impacted heavily by recent crises including the fodder crisis when last summer s drought led to a shortage of silage and hay which had to be imported from elsewhere in europe the potential impact of brexit and of mercosur where both emphasised at the protest rally ireland has historically been heavily reliant on exports of beef to the uk and despite some changes in recent years this is still the case edmond phelan of the icsa irish cattle and sheep association drew attention to mercosur three years ago our organisation stood here protesting against mercosur it was a bad deal that day and it is a bad deal today he said the taoiseach leo varadkar would want to stand up for us or else stand down and if any supermarket thinks they re going to sell brazilian beef we ll close them down mercosur has nothing to do with beef it s all about selling german cars we re not going to lie down and let it happen concluded hugh doyle of beef plan pointed to the sheer scale of amazon rainforest clearance emphasising that we have only one climate if we destroy that climate we will have to look our children in the eyes and say i m sorry and that is just not good enough while beef farmer viability was the core message it was also highlighted by the speakers that this protest was not only a farmers protest but also a rural ireland and climate protest as sinn fein leader mary lou mc donald put it the amazon are the lungs of the world and mercosur represents a sell out of irish farmers and called on taoiseach leo varadkar to support her party s motion to reject the deal impact on small to medium sized farmers in eu and south america mercosur concerns are not only to be found in beef producing countries in europe argentina s national association of entrepreneurs fears small and medium sized enterprises are going to be the most affected by these policies the organization said adding that the only beneficiaries from the free trade pact would be large multinational firms and exporters in the agribusiness to the detriment of local industries ireland is in a similar situation where main beef processor abp run by larry goodman has nearly full control over beef supply and in turn also controls the prices and factories goodman s net worth is about e3 5 billion while his company contributed little in tax returns from its e170 million profits the irish times reported last month on top of this his family receives hundreds of thousands of euros in cap subsidies each year making him one of ireland s leading beneficiaries if this deal gets the go ahead rain forest clearance will increase while the extra importing of 99000t of beef from south america to the eu will in itself have an environmental impact ireland in turn will end up with even more mostly monoculture plantations of sitka spruce which is being pushed hard by the irish government as an alternative to struggling beef and sheep farming despite the negative consequences environmentally of this marchers were also concerned about the social and economic impact on rural ireland of the end of beef farming for every euro in an average suckler farmers pocket more than 4 euro of economic activity is generated in local economies mental health in rural farming communities is declining due to economic pressure and rural isolation huge doyle pointed out that nearly 53 years ago sixteen farmers of the national farmers association started a 217 mile walk from bantry in co cork to dublin to demand better rights working conditions and incomes for farmers by the time they marched through merrion street their number had grown to 30 000 we see ourselves back here today fighting for the same rights he added these where remembered by the protesters in dublin and there was an air of hope for the future as hugh doyle put it in an interview this will not be the last you hear from us and if the government of ireland fails us we will take further action to ensure the survival of rural ireland and its small suckler farmers it may be the case that mercosur will be a catalyst to make a real change as the protest last wednesday has shown when it really comes to it the rural population will stand up and not only shout but also work together and make those changes happen more on ireland from 2019 more on ireland 2013 2019
the international monetary fund completed a review on friday of argentina s economic performance allowing the release of 5 4 billion to the country in a loan program intended to help stabilize its economy the imf board approved the fourth review of the south american country s performance under the loan deal signed last year the argentine authorities continue to show a strong commitment to their economic policy program meeting all applicable targets under the fund supported program said imf managing director david lipton in a statement noting that financial markets have stabilized lipton also said that inflation while still high had decreased and appeared to be on an overall downward path the economy is beginning a gradual recovery from last year s recession he said increased uncertainty despite the imf s confidence american credit rating agency moody s changed argentina s outlook on friday from stable to negative moody s based its decision on increased uncertainty that argentina would continue to implement policies that would stabilize its economy and its currency it said in a statement president mauricio macri has faced increasing pressure over the misfiring economy with presidential elections set for october he was forced to impose austerity measures as authorities struggled to stabilize the currency and rein in inflation to ensure access to imf funding consumer inflation hit 3 1 percent in may and has risen more than 19 percent so far this year while unemployment closed last year just over nine percent and the poverty rate rose to 32 percent argentina originally secured a 50 billion financing package from the imf in june 2018 before returning to the fund to ask for an additional 6 billion and accelerated disbursements in exchange for tougher conditions
the overarching objective of the international monetary fund imf programme is to restore external and internal balance in pakistan so that the country can achieve sustainable growth said imf mission chief for pakistan ernesto ramirez rigo i think the government s programme which is now supported by the fund s programme has two main pillars and i will develop each of them a little bit he said on saturday in a conference call on the release of imf staff report on the extended fund facility for pakistan the first pillar is obviously macroeconomic stabilisation the second pillar is to strengthen and build institutions on the first pillar of macroeconomic stabilisation which was critical for restoring external and internal balance the focus was on the fiscal side given the large deficits and high debt in order to improve revenue mobilisation he said according to rigo the main problem in pakistan is the low level of revenue collection relative to its gross domestic product gdp and relative to many other emerging markets and peer countries so this is where we have put our focus he said the imf has focused on increasing revenues by broadening the tax base and not by increasing tax rates he stressed in addition to that given the external sector conditions the imf has focused on having a flexible market determined exchange rate which should help restore balance he added he was of the view that it was going to help develop local financial markets which were fundamental for growth and in the medium term every country required financial deepening the flexible market determined exchange rate will also improve conditions for local producers and for the export sector he voiced hope in addition there is a third pillar of macroeconomic stabilisation which is to basically increase social spending there was a substantial increase in allocation for some of the social programmes in the budget he appreciated adding that this was something that the imf welcomed he underlined that the imf wanted to make sure that the adjustment was on the revenue side and not on the expenditure side and budget 2019 20 sent a strong signal in that direction now let me turn to the other main pillar of the adjustment which is building institutions this is going to be done in parallel so it is not the sequencing it is going to be followed at the same time as the macroeconomic stabilisation is put in place rigo said he noted that this was basically about improving business and doing business in pakistan reducing red tape streamlining regulations having tax policy reforms etc rigo emphasised that the imf programme was going to act as a catalyst where the authority provided a framework in which many other international partners were to participate the total amount of financing that the programme is going to be unlocking is around 38 billion he said i think you might have seen already that in our press release after the approval of the programme published in the express tribune july 14 2019 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation
negotiations on the minimum wage in colombia are fast approaching on the one hand unions will demand an increase above inflation to safeguard their purchasing power which has been badly hit by the recent tax reform on the other side entrepreneurs will be arguing that the remuneration for work must be aligned with labor productivity the discussion surely will discuss arguments to protect workers while ignoring structural realities when it comes to productivity in a global economy the results of the private competitiveness council are astounding it takes around four colombian workers to produce what one does in the united states there are two main reasons that can help to shed light on the reasons for our lack of productivity 1 poor investment in innovation and training for work and 2 a high rate of informality advertisement ricardo hausmann in an article published by projec syndicate suggests that copying models such as silicon valley without having gone through the previous steps for a similar ecosystem to occur is innocuous and gives suggestions to promote innovation in countries going through the process of development this economist reminds us that most of the investments in research and development in the developed world were driven by large companies such as at t which had a monopoly position in the market this company invested large sums of money in laboratories and think tanks and developed technologies such as fax lasers radars and satellite communications among others unfortunately colombian monopolies invest little in innovation and talent training most of their efforts are aimed at protecting their businesses from global competition and sustaining deficient production structures which generate a higher cost to users for poor quality service it s time to change the way we look at the cartels that dominate our economy either we pass true antitrust laws or we look for ways to get more involved in improving labor competitiveness and innovate for this we need to develop a synergy between the corporation the academy and the state the education system must be more relevant to real work experience and workers must be taught about new technologies the business sector must clearly define its needs when it comes to human resources and the state must curtail its protectionism which seeks to stifle competition through trade restrictions and tax benefits which aid colombian corporations at the expense of the colombian consumer additionally colombia has the second highest rate of labor informality in the region surpassed only by peru this is due to a combination of several factors very high taxes a lackluster education system and a high minimum wage compared to the average salary the minimum wage exceeds the average salary in only six of colombia s 32 states informality is the main explanation of low productivity it generates disincentives for the accumulation of human capital one in three workers in the formal sector requires high levels of complex cognitive skills while only one in six in the informal sector requires them to reverse the trend it is necessary to find ways for these workers to access training programs for work policies such as trade schools and government training programs such as ser pilo paga a colombian program translated it pays to be smart can be effective in breaking the vicious circle as they give children of informal workers access to quality education we do ourselves a disservice by adhering to the same old arguments if the problem of low labor productivity is not addressed we will continue with high rates of informality in the labor market and will be ill equipped to compete in the global economy advertisement share this share print twitter telegram tumblr reddit pocket linkedin pinterest mastodon whatsapp email facebook like this like loading related article originally appeared on today colombia and is republished here with permission
the economic survey said rightly that no country had ever grown fast without buoyant exports and called for policies to generate a virtuous cycle of rising exports gdp savings and investment the budget fails comprehensively to do this far from taking india to 8 per cent growth it could take india down to 6 per cent why have exports hardly grown for five years because india is a high cost economy that cannot compete with its asian peers india has among the highest cost land labour capital electricity railway freight rates air freight corporate and income tax rates a thrust for 8 per cent growth requires lowering every one of these rates alas the budget goes in the opposite direction back in 2007 finance minister chidambaram grasped the importance of being competitive and decreed that import duties should be reduced till they approximated the asian norm of 10 per cent that was achieved by a series of cuts till 2008 and helped fuel india s biggest boom then arun jaitley said india would cut its corporate tax rate to 25 per cent to compete with asia this vision has been abandoned by nirmala sitharaman she has done nothing to bring down the high costs of so many items she has yet to cut corporate tax to the promised 25 per cent rate for large companies with revenue of over rs 400 crore meanwhile corporate tax in many asian countries has fallen to 15 20 per cent the new peak income tax rate of 42 7 per cent is out of line with rates in several competing countries sitharaman wants to attract foreign investment and talent but 42 7 per cent income tax is a clear disincentive foreign portfolio investors organised as trusts suddenly find they have to pay 42 7 per cent tax and are exiting causing a crash in stock markets many indian businessmen will move to low tax havens like singapore and dubai 7 000 billionaires have already left in recent years corporate promoters will keep profits in companies instead of distributing them as dividends that are highly taxed so the policy in antidividend a wedge as high as 17 7 per cent between the top income tax rate and corporate tax rate is a recipe for proliferating tax avoidance the additional revenue sought by the budget may not accrue at all an elementary precept of economic liberalisation is that a tax on imports becomes a tax on exports it creates a high cost economy appreciates the exchange rate and induces investment to shift from export production to import substitution it induces retaliation against indian exports as the usa has demonstrated far from seeing this as a problem sitharaman wants to encourage it jaitley in last year s budget started the dismal trend of raising import duties on overt 40 items just for protection sitharaman expands the list much further this year declaring explicitly that she aims to reduce import dependence protect the msme sector and curb non essential imports this is the language of the licence permit raj that trapped india into the hindu rate of growth of 3 5 per cent infant industry protection for temporary periods has created competitive industries in some countries but the new levies have no sunset clause the industries being protected by sitharaman are not infants merely traditional bjp vote banks attracting large foreign investment to boost investment requires stability and predictability in tax rates but constant changes in income tax surcharges and import tariffs represent tax policy driven by lobbying not transparent principles foreign investors will not respond to her incentives if these can change at political whim in the next budget india urgently needs new land laws to slash land prices and acquisition costs new labour laws that reduce effective cost through flexibility lower fiscal deficits that help reduce the interest rate electricity reforms that end high industrial rates to subsidise farmers rail reforms that end high freight rates that subsidise passenger traffic lower taxes on aviation spirit to lower air freight and a shift from high support prices for crops to direct cash benefits for farmers to lower agricultural prices and make them internationally competitive this is a huge and politically difficult agenda nobody could expect modi to grasp such thorny nettles in an election year but despite winning a landslide lok sabha victory he remains in election mode because some state election or another is always a few months away modi and sitharaman need to realise that the need of the hour is not to just to compete with the congress and regional parties more important is the need to compete with china and other competitors like bangladesh vietnam indonesia and thailand they all have lower costs and faster export growth
u s states and cities hand out tens of billions in taxpayer dollars every year to companies as economic incentives these businesses are supposed to use the money typically distributed through economic development programs to open new facilities create jobs and generate tax revenue but all too often that s not what happens as i ve learned after doing research on the use of tax incentives to spur economic development in cities and states across the country particularly in texas recent scandals involving economic development programs in new jersey baltimore and elsewhere illustrate just what s wrong with these programs and why i believe it s time to end this waste of taxpayer dollars once and for all economic development 101 many states counties and cities have economic development agencies tasked with facilitating investment in their communities these agencies undertake a variety of valuable activities from gathering data to training small businesses owners yet one of their most high profile activities is the use of tax and other incentives to entice companies to invest in their communities generating local jobs and expanding the tax base estimates of how much is spent on such incentives range from us 45 billion to 80 billion a year but what do taxpayers get for all this money as it turns out not much 1 a waste of money first off in most cases investments that result from these incentives would have happened anyway that was the case in baltimore involving a federal program meant to spur development in distressed communities it dubbed opportunity zones propublica reported in june that maryland accidentally designated an area of baltimore that wasn t poor and was already under redevelopment an opportunity zone despite catching the error the state kept the designation allowing real estate investors to potentially claim millions of dollars in tax breaks those investors include kevin plank the billionaire ceo of under armour who owns about 40 of the zone according to propublica this example isn t unique last year tim bartik an economist at the upjohn institute for employment research reviewed 30 studies on the use of economic development incentives he found that 75 to 98 of companies were planning to make the desired investment anyway in my own work in texas i found that more than 85 of the companies offered tax breaks had already planned to open the promised new facilities a few even broke ground before applying for the incentives and in new jersey investigators who uncovered abuse in the state s economic development program found that a lawyer representing a powerful democratic official drafted legislation to benefit companies tied to him and his associates to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars their june report described how the new jersey economic development agency didn t perform the basic due diligence of a single google search which would have shown that some of the companies had already announced a move to new jersey before being offered incentives 2 investments rarely pay off even when an incentive does draw new investments they rarely pay off and they can even harm the fiscal health of cities and states by pulling resources away from other more productive activities in incentives to pander a book i co authored with duke political scientist edmund malesky we reviewed the academic literature in the u s and elsewhere on the use of incentives and found that they are expensive and ineffective in generating employment and economic growth wisconsin residents may be learning this the hard way after their government offered electronics manufacturer foxconn over 4 billion in incentives in exchange for a promise to build a high tech facility that is supposed to create 13 000 jobs but since the 2017 announcement the company has failed to meet job targets and even downgraded the type of facility it plans to build 3 a failure of oversight a third problem is that government agencies fail to provide effective oversight to ensure that company promises on investment and employment like foxconn s are upheld a legislative audit found that the wisconsin agency responsible follows problematic oversight practices and failed to verify that companies created the number of jobs or other goals they claimed wisconsin isn t alone many states and municipalities provide limited oversight of the economic incentives they offer and often rely on companies self reported data to determine whether they ve met targets in texas doctoral candidate calvin thrall and i found that the state even allowed companies to renegotiate their job creation targets sometimes the day before they were required to report compliance with an incentive agreement and even though these deals are often accompanied by splashy pr campaigns that highlight how many jobs will be created the incentive contracts often don t even include actual job creation requirements and only 56 of cities surveyed indicated that they required a performance agreement before offering incentives new jersey investigators found similar oversight problems and other shortcomings in its economic development program finally a lack of transparency surrounding these programs makes it hard for others to determine whether taxpayers got what they were promised ending incentives so you re probably wondering if these incentives don t work why do government officials continue to use and promote them the book i wrote with malesky and a related paper showed how these incentives provide a way for politicians to take credit for business investment in the hopes that it will give them a lift in their next election all they have to do is convince voters that these programs work and that the grand promises being made when officials cut ribbons in well publicized ceremonies will eventually pan out powerful special interest groups are also to blame as they play a big role in shaping incentive programs and lobby vigorously for lawmakers to create them and keep them alive rather than reform or rebrand these programs i believe states should take the advice of some of their own evaluations of these programs and eliminate them taxpayers would be better off without them nathan jensen professor of government university of texas at austin
some that emerged in the last few weeks include fairly drastic declines in economic or business activity surveys conducted by fed regional offices and the biggest one month drop ever in a morgan stanley survey of business confidence taking it to its lowest level since 2008 ihs markit flash surveys showed the slowest expansion in manufacturing in three years and the lowest reading for the service economy since 2009 and orders for durable goods dropped 3 3 per cent in the 12 months through may the biggest annual drop since 2016 many readings from foreign economies are much worse the on again off again on hold again trade war with china and occasionally canada mexico and europe hasn t helped confidence anywhere neither have simmering tensions with iran or britain s inability to engineer a graceful exit from the european union real time data flow is mostly slanted negative said tad rivelle chief investment officer for fixed income at tcw if we re not in a recession then we re on the cusp olga bitel global strategist for william blair co finds that the cusp has come and gone in some sectors globally we can say that the industrial side of the economy is in recession she said for growth to stabilise we need to see a rebound that depends on the trade outlook where bitel said the outcome is binary advertisement if we have a solution things could stabilise she said if there s no solution things could go south in a hurry she s optimistic that something will get done in the next two to three quarters because consumers are starting to feel it in their wallets as tariffs drive up the prices of foreign goods but she warned that if we were to have further escalation retail consumption would take a substantial hit and show up in much weaker growth numbers there may be a third option on trade an extended stalemate that could be the result of president donald trump s meeting with chinese president xi jinping at the group of 20 summit last month the leaders agreed to keep disagreeing but to resume talks at some point that was a tiny bit better than expectations said rebecca patterson chief investment officer of bessemer trust it doesn t mean anything s resolved both sides want a deal but how long it takes to get from a to b and what the details of b are remains to be seen in the meantime she said you just have this persistent uncertainty weighing on business activity and driving economic indicators down the iffy to awful backdrop is doing no favours for the bottom line as the third quarter began earnings for the s p 500 companies were estimated by factset to have declined 2 6 per cent in the 12 months through june after a 0 3 per cent year on year drop in the first quarter the forecast for the current period is a 0 5 per cent decline advertisement none of these developments seemed to matter much to buyers who pushed the index to gains of 3 8 per cent for the second quarter and 17 3 per cent for the first half after falling in may it had its best june since 1955 reaching new highs that have lingered into july that helped the average domestic stock fund tracked by morningstar to gain 3 6 per cent in the quarter with portfolios focused on financial services and technology doing especially well international stock funds did almost as well as their domestic peers rising 3 1 per cent helped by latin america portfolios and held back by losses for funds that specialise in china the market has been largely unperturbed by the persistent economic weakness because each bad piece of data is taken as confirmation the fed will ease but andrew sheets chief cross asset strategist at morgan stanley finds such thinking perverse we strongly disagree with this bad is good logic and the line of reasoning behind it sheets said in a june 13 podcast on the company s website the expectation that easing central bank policy will offset weaker data is at odds with both a wide reading of historical data and monetary theory changes in fed policy take up to a year to affect economic growth he noted the weak data can damp consumer and business sentiment and activity further depressing growth and encouraging risk aversion among investors but stock investors seem to be fixed on the view the central bank will bail them out while the economy is still healthy advertisement the markets have learned to seek the opium of fed intervention and have grown accustomed to the idea that it will fix everything said rivelle of tcw that s a dangerous misplaced idea market forces always overwhelm anything central banks can do the forces he had in mind appeared to be at work in the bond market by briefly pushing 10 year treasury yields below 2 per cent in early july close to 2016 record lows bond traders were pricing in a long run of low growth despite the multiple rate cuts already factored into short term interest rates even though yields have already fallen a lot rivelle recommends that investors play it safe and put their money into treasurys and high quality corporate stuff the decline in long term yields to below three month treasury bill rates created an inversion of the yield curve a reliable precursor of recession an inversion occurred in march it was widely remarked upon then widely dismissed because it lasted only a few days the curve inverted again on may 23 according to the federal reserve bank of st louis and it has been inverted ever since that s harder to ignore whatever the implications of the inversion bond prices rise when yields fall so bond funds did well in the second quarter up 2 5 per cent long term government funds were standouts rising 5 8 per cent while there s debate over how much the fed can help the economy few on wall street seem to doubt that it s willing to try mightily but in patterson s view the fed will need room to move more aggressively later if needed advertisement i don t think the fed s going to cut nearly as much as is priced in she said even before the strong jobs report prompted a reassessment by some traders of just how many rate cuts may be in store if not they re going to have to walk back expectations that will be a fun little dance to do she predicts a quarter point cut at the july meeting when it comes to expectations for share prices hers are meager you want to add risk at this juncture i m going the other way patterson said taking a bit of profits is a pretty good idea the market s putting too much on the fed to save us she would shift a modest amount from stocks to government bonds even with yields so low and she would make a small allocation to gold because it often moves independently of other assets she also likes singapore stocks because of the country s sound economy and she would avoid most other foreign markets particularly in europe and japan bitel of william blair is less averse to stocks but she prefers defensive niches such as software services and health care technology their revenues are more stable and predictable she said they re expensive but they ll continue to perform in a downturn she would avoid economically sensitive market segments although she acknowledged that they re cheap and that if the economy bounces back unexpectedly they should do well advertisement as far as arnott of research affiliates is concerned it s definitely time to be risk off in us assets not only does the economy appear fragile he said but the sharemarket is expensive by just about any measure you look at and is priced to give you terrible forward looking returns emerging markets carry half the valuations of american stocks he said debt in emerging markets yields more than american high yield debt he added and he would own some along with treasury bonds even though treasury yields have shrunk they re far higher than japanese or european equivalents he noted arnott also favours european stocks especially in britain where the market trades at roughly a 60 per cent discount to the united states if you re still worried that fighting the fed is too tough remember that you wouldn t be its only opponent there s the bond market and the deteriorating economy and as rivelle warned there are the ramifications as yet unknown of using exotic methods to push markets to levels that they wouldn t have reached on their own and that might prove unsustainable if the bull market has been substantially due to central bank policy then you have a situation where the institution is responsible for creating the problem he said we re running an experiment and acting like we know the consequences

two economic stories received big headlines the week of july 4 the dow jones industrial average hit a record high and the economy added 224 000 jobs in june on the surface the nation s economy looks to be in great shape especially if you own stocks but just as july 4 holiday beachgoers were concerned about what danger lurks beneath the water s surface we should be worried about below the surface turbulence not reported in these feel good economic stories while the department of labor reports june to be a strong month for job creation it fails to report results for big businesses versus small businesses for that information we must turn to another jobs report the adp national employment report is a highly respected private sector assessment of the nation s nonfarm private sector payroll data in theory it measures the same state of jobs in the country as department of labor statistics but its methodology yields results that can be considered far more accurate the report analyzes the data for businesses with 50 or more employees and small businesses with 49 or fewer workers as it turns out the june jobs difference between big and small businesses is large and scary according to the adp june report small businesses lost 23 000 total jobs last month a closer look at this data shows that small businesses with fewer than 20 employees which comprise the vast majority of small businesses shed 37 000 jobs while those having 20 49 workers added 14 000 jobs these smallest of businesses are the canary in the coal mine most net new jobs come from startups less than 5 years old with four or fewer employees today our country is having a crisis in new small business startups there is something very wrong with our economy that is being masked by big corporations still living off the giant and permanent 40 percent tax rate cut they received from the 2017 tax law this tax reform drove stocks higher primarily for the benefit of shareholders and corporate executives but corporate job growth is now running out of gas down on average about 23 percent compared to last year at this time unfortunately june was the second consecutive month of economic danger warnings coming from small businesses which employ about half of all americans in may adp reported that small businesses with fewer than 20 employees which make up about 67 percent of all businesses in the nation shed 50 000 jobs small businesses shrinking by 87 000 jobs over two months should be newsworthy unfortunately not only is the press missing this economic story so are our elected leaders who can do something about this before we fall into a recession the key to any effort to promote the health of small businesses is to deliver on the promises made by proponents of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act give the average family a raise to create more consumer demand for small business goods and services and promote entrepreneurship and small business growth through proper tax policy the 4 000 extra income for families promised by the 2017 tax law never materialized in fact half of all american families have less wealth today than they did 30 years ago likewise a poll by businesses for responsible tax reform found that 72 percent of small business owners say the 2017 tax law had either no positive effect on their business or a negative effect for the sake of our economy we must revisit the 2017 tax reform and do it right this time for families we must lower the cost of health care education and child care while removing mountains of counter productive college debt all this will spur economic growth in our local communities to inspire entrepreneurship and help small businesses we could make the first 25 000 in small business profit tax free or double the startup tax deduction for small businesses to pay for this we can start by rolling back the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the super wealthy the danger beneath this shimmering economy s surface is real it s time for politicians and elected leaders to heed the warnings

this article is more than 4 years old 2018 bloomberg finance lp people don t flee their homes because they want to they flee their homes because they feel they have to those are the words of nayib bukele president of el salvador and as reported by kirk semple of the new york times one senses that people understand the above well when politics and partisanship are left out of the migration discussion that the desperate from other countries routinely risk everything to get to the united states because it s where the jobs are some say it s about collecting welfare despite the fact that even legal immigrants aren t eligible to access welfare for five years but to bring up the latter is to miss the point they come here for the jobs so long as the u s economy booms the world s poorest will continue to find ways to make it to the country where hard work is a certain path out of poverty bukele says it is our fault as in el salvador s that so many salvadorans have left a country where poverty is the brutally persistent norm most of the salvadorans have migrated to the united states the number according to the new york times 1 4 million one can only hope that the times editorialists are made aware of the previous number since it s one that slays various economic myths routinely promoted on the newspaper s editorial page for one times editorialists frequently argue that government spending is the driver of economic growth salvadorans would surely protest what is absurd and that is most aggressively promoted by a certain princeton economist who has a prominent column on the times editorial page they would reject keynesian mythology mainly because the latter suggests el salvador s economic struggles are an effect of too little government spending such a view isn t serious a more realistic truth is that government spending doesn t power economic growth as much as it s a consequence of it in el salvador s case there s very little government spending precisely because a lack of economic dynamism in the country means there s very little achievement for government to tax in the first place this of course explains why so many salvadorans bring their previously suffocated talents to the united states this is where it gets interesting you see according to the times in 2018 salvadorans abroad sent nearly 5 5 billion in remittances to el salvador equivalent to about 20 percent of the nation s gross domestic product what little growth of the gdp variety that there is in el salvador is actually growth that first took place in the u s it s a reminder to the keynesians who dominate the economics profession that consumption as gdp measures is always and everywhere an effect of production first while el salvador s gdp is pretty small a big portion of it is the result of production that took place stateside production first then consumption where it gets even more interesting is that according to a migration policy institute study cited by semple remittances from abroad constitute two or three times the country s public social spending this matters simply because it s a reminder that governments once again can only spend most often in wasteful fashion insofar as the private sector is producing wealth for them to spend government spending yet again doesn t power economic growth as much as it s an effect of it it s not as though el salvador s politicians are less keynesian than their counterparts up north and it s not as though they re particularly frugal the simpler story is that there s very little growth in el salvador for the government to tax that explains why most aid to el salvador is actually a happy result of stateside production oh well all aid government private or ngo is always always always a consequence of private sector production much as economists at princeton might wish otherwise the laws of economics are just that governments ngos and people can only spend insofar as private sector production has already taken place only for the fruits of that production to be shifted to others or for governments to take it from the productive only to redistribute it to government consumers taking the remittance story even further it s useful to stress that money on its own serves no purpose money is only useful insofar as there are actual goods to be exchanged which brings us to the monetarist school of thought for the longest time monetarists have posed as free market types why not milton friedman was a prominent monetarist that he was is a reminder that even friedman missed on a few things the simple truth is that monetarism is just keynesianism turned inside out keynesians believe government spending powers growth no it s a consequence of it monetarists believe money creation powers economic growth no it s a consequence of it that there are billions of dollars circulating in el salador isn t an effect of federal reserve benevolence whereby dollars are printed for salvadorans to spend rather the dollars circulate in the country precisely because some of the fruits of production that takes place in the u s are shifted down to el salvador as previously mentioned over 5 billion was shifted to el salvador in 2018 this matters because absent u s based production that empowers salvadorans to spend dollars would serve no purpose in el salvador but since stateside production accounts for at least a fifth of the salvadoran economy the salvadoran people have consumptive powers that businesses aim to meet money supply is production determined and dollars are increasingly abundant in el salvador thanks to production up north if you see a monetarist give this person a hug with their rejections of keynesianism they doth protest too much monetarists are confused and in their rejection of ludicrous keynesian thought processes they reveal themselves as self hating money follows production as opposed to it stimulating it the good news with el salvador is that president bukele at least recognizes that salvadorans lucky enough to not be in el salvador quickly discover productive skills that are smothered within their own country policy matters as it were which is a statement of the obvious unknown is if the policy types lucky enough to be in the united states will allow the lessons of el salvador to clear their clouded minds keynesians and monetarists need to exit their shared room

menafn the costa rica news the economic structure of costa rica lies basically in tourism agriculture and the export of electronic equipment and services the country significantly reduced poverty from 1950 to 1980 thanks to a strong impulse on the part of the state to the production processes for the internal market as well as to the development of a strong social investment in education health electricity telecommunications and provision of water services among others the costa rican economy is the tenth economy in latin america in terms of nominal gross domestic product gdp eighteenth after uruguay and before panama and twelfth in terms of purchasing power parity prices ppp after panama and before bolivia costa rica has a per capita income of usd 13 192 gdp and usd 18 660 gdp per capita ppa the reduction of poverty stopped during the crisis of the 80s and stagnated at the end of the 90s oscillating between 20 and 22 of the population this stagnation began before the beginning of neoliberal policy policies through which spaces have been opened up to private activities at the expense of many of the services previously provided by public institutions although the economy and wealth have grown significantly poverty stopped decreasing because the models oriented to the creation of specialized employment exclude people without university or technical training the high government deficit decreased during the decades of the 80s and 90 s the amount of money destined to maintain the quality of the country s social services the austerity policy promulgated during the administration of abel pacheco de la esperilla managed to reduce the deficit and even managed to obtain a surplus in 2005 due to the low investment of the state and improvements in fiscal matters the inflation rate was around 22 5 in 1995 fell substantially to 11 1 in 1997 12 in 2005 13 9 in 2008 23 to reach 4 05 in 2009 then again rose to 5 58 in 2010 ranged 5 between 2011 and 2013 closing 2014 at 5 13 in 2015 the country experienced deflation for the first time in 40 years closing the year at 0 83 from which it began to recover in 2016 when it closed with inflation of 0 77 in 2017 the indicator stood at 2 57 and according to the central bank of costa rica a similar index was produced in 2018 small but stable country thanks to their stable and developed economic base costa ricans enjoy a higher standard of living than many other citizens of neighboring countries although costa rica s economy is not as powerful as the us economy or the european countries which undoubtedly pummeled their weight and were lucky enough to recover quickly from the global financial crisis costa rica has a gdp of 71 billion making it the 77th most powerful economy in the world and the 10th most influential in latin america considering that it has a relatively small population this is a pretty impressive position when the gdp results are adjusted to take the population into account costa rica moves to 75th place and is just above the global average this means that the development of the country extends quite evenly throughout the population and that for the most part certain regions or sectors of the population have not been left behind despite this around 25 of the population lives at or below the poverty line costa rica has a fairly low level of unemployment with only 7 9 of the population out of work the active population is employed in a variety of sectors but those working in the primary and secondary sectors produced 11 66 billion of the value of exports in 2013 about 30 of these products went to the us with 13 2 more going to china the same year the country imported goods worth 17 56 billion with almost half coming from the us history of the economy of costa rica like the rest of latin america costa rica began as a spanish colony and its function was to produce goods to enrich the spanish monarchy the country was a haven during the colonial period however and to a large extent it was not taken into account by the spanish in their frantic search for gold the result was a small economy with the majority of the inhabitants practicing small scale agriculture neighboring countries had made huge fortunes focusing on cash crops such as sugar or tobacco and after independence the government decided that costa rica s economy needed an update they settled in coffee and of course the export of this grain led to economic growth and a constant flow of money coming in this was complemented by the growth of banana plantations on the caribbean coast the export of commercial crops benefited many countries in the latin american region and became the cornerstone of most of their economies but the practice was a double edged sword however and these countries became dangerously dependent on nonproduction this economic model had two main problems first when the overall value of the product was reduced the country would experience a sudden and dramatic fall in revenues the second problem is that often the more developed countries would buy the raw products transform them into finished products and then sell them back to the latin american countries at a higher price costa rica was more aware of this problem than many of its neighbors and took steps to diversify its economy today only 7 6 of its exports consist of bananas and coffee with 6 7 more coming from other fruits and vegetables the country has established itself as a leading producer of electronic circuits and pharmaceuticals as well as medical instruments this means that not only is the dependence on a single product decreased but it also significantly increased the manufacturing of diverse finished products these sensible policies mean that although the economy of costa rica was affected by the global financial crisis in 2008 it recovered fairly quickly and in 2010 the economy was growing at 4 per year costa rica is the fifth best economy in latin america to do business and ranks 61st in the world among 190 countries according to the dingo business 2018 indicator ease to do business costa rica implemented two reforms that improve its business climate which was to facilitate the registration of properties and to protect minority investors to facilitate the registration of property costa rica reduced the time needed to transfer property through several measures including the introduction of effective time limits tourism ecotourism is extremely popular among foreign tourists who visit the vast number of national parks and protected areas that exist throughout the country costa rica was one of the pioneers in ecotourism and is recognized as one of the few international destinations with true ecotourism options in the 2018 competitiveness index for travel and tourism costa rica reached the 44th place being the first ranked among latin american countries the competitive advantages to develop tourism ventures are in the area of human cultural and natural resources in which costa rica ranks 24th worldwide and ranks seventh place when only the natural resources factor is considered with revenues of us 1 900 million per year the tourism industry costa rica stands out as the most visited destination in central america with a total of 2 1 million foreign tourists in 2017 with 470 visitors per thousand inhabitants costa rica has one of the highest rates of tourists per capita in the caribbean basin the majority of foreign visitors come from the united states and canada 46 and from european union countries 16 which allow the country to receive on average approximately us 1000 per visitor the value per visit highest in latin america in 2018 tourism contributed 9 1 of the country s gdp and represented 14 3 of jobs direct and indirect since the beginning of the 2000s tourism generates more foreign exchange income for the country than the export of bananas and coffee together
washington us federal reserve chairman jerome powell is starting to sound a bit like he is the world s central banker in congressional testimony last week he repeatedly cited a slower global economic expansion in laying out the case for easier us monetary policy there s something going on with the growth around the world particularly around manufacturing investment and trade he told the house financial services committee on wednesday as he all but promised an interest rate cut at the end of this month mr powell is not merely being altruistic as he himself said the international slowdown and heightened trade tensions are weighing on the domestic outlook and with other major central banks running short of monetary ammunition that arguably places more of an onus on the fed to support the economy worldwide to prevent it from dragging down the us there are limited tools available in the global central bank community putting the spotlight on the fed to ease and underpin global growth and financial conditions bank of america economist michelle meyer and her colleagues wrote in a july 10 note in one sense mr powell is just trying to undo the damage us president donald trump s trade policies have caused for the world economy mr trump s tariffs realised and threatened have prompted multinational corporations to put off capital spending plans dampening global growth mr powell has cited china and its effort to deleverage its economy as a potential source of weakness this is not the first time the fed has shifted its stance in response to changes outside the us in 2016 it scaled back plans to increase rates as an abrupt decline in china s currency shook international financial markets and in 1998 it cut rates three times in rapid fire succession as russia s debt default rocked the world economy but the fed with interest rates close to 2 5 per cent has now much more leeway to promote growth than either the bank of japan or the european central bank both have negative rates in an interview fed vice chairman richard clarida pointed to something else that has changed in recent years namely a much more globalised capital market this means the us is more affected by developments abroad than a mere toting up of its exports and imports would suggest that exposure comes through the ups and downs of the world s financial markets as investors move trillions of dollars around the globe and the knock on effects those market moves can have on the domestic economy in the final analysis of course the fed is responsible for managing america s economy not the world s and for meeting its twin goals of maximum employment and stable prices but mr powell is still being thrust into taking a bigger role to support expansion internationally and with it in the us people are very concerned about global growth and we will feel that over time mr powell told the senate banking committee on thursday that s the main thing i worry about washington post
shareholder value magazine published article of interest by john m collard turnaround specialist outside independent director money capital finder interim executive and private equity advisor www strategicmgtpartners com www strategicmgtpartners com svm vcm pdf formatted version article of interest built to sell value creation model by john m collard valuing a company is the easy part creating that value in the first place so you can measure it is a more formidable task create a value equation to build worth into your company determining value is more art form than science true value can only be established at the time of a transaction where willing buyer tenders payment and willing seller accepts it in exchange buyers and sellers look at the component make up of a company differently and therefore place different values on these ingredients and on the whole to enhance the real company value analyze company components as they relate to worth in the mind of potential buyers value to one buyer often does not necessarily hold the same value for another establish multiple buyer profiles depending upon the circumstances and prepare to build value each would be willing to pay for there are essentially two kinds of buyers strategic and annuity buyers both with different motives yet both demand returns for their shareholders the strategic buyer purchases for reasons that fit into their strategic plan they benefit through synergies like acquiring customer base in expanded territories new products added capacity and reduced costs et cetera this type of buyer may place some value in the first line management team but will see added value in the ability to place their own managers into key positions the annuity or financial buyer on the other hand sees value in the stand alone entity s ability to generate cash flow from profits year after year the institutional buyer places the highest value on how motivated and incentivized the existing management team is and their receptiveness to remain to generate cash and profits the owner operator conversely will look at buying a job typically strategic buyers of closely held companies purchase at six to 10 times earnings and or cash flow while annuity buyers pay two to six times cash flow the ultimate worth of the company depends upon who the buyer will be these multiples are usually considerably higher in public companies but the concepts of building value are the same the essential is to look at what is valuable and understand how to exploit and preserve this value from the start plan to sell the business and put value creation into perspective free cash flow and the continued ability to produce it with reliable probability creates the greatest value this is not as easy as it sounds in fact it can be complicated is often misunderstood and frequently is bungled look at the elements in the value creation equation to see how each brings forth value and how together they compound the effect value creation net asset value future revenue stream going concern value incentive to purchase net asset value nav sometimes referred to as orderly liquidation value it is the cash net worth of assets less encumbrances if you were to liquidate these assets at a fair market price under orderly disposition conditions when liquidation is not necessary this nav can equal net worth on the balance sheet but is often adjusted for the value of intangibles simply stated tangible unencumbered book value intangible assets adjustments to market value over amortized depreciated expensed assets or usable inventory written down lower than market value obsolete inventory and bad debts outstanding obligations on open contracts market value build a strong healthy balance sheet with adequate reserves and proper statement of asset value because this is a fundamental on which to expand a company and increase its worth tangible assets can be appraised to establish their worth on the other hand intangible assets are harder to value because they are subject to interpretation if you sell a machine you realize cash for the transaction but if you lose a customer no one pays you for it they re just gone intellectual property is also hard to value but filing more patents will generate value particularly to those who can afford to protect them from infringement the real opportunity lies not in building asset base but in building maximum return on those assets and deployed capital assets don t generate worth by themselves they can only be used to generate worth if the asset sits idle it is actually losing value but if volume causes the asset to work to produce output production value is being created the closer the relationship of assets to realize 1 for each 1 dollar on the balance sheet the better cash and securities fit this description accounts receivable will be discounted as they age focus on keeping the days outstanding as low as possible utilize percentage completion contracts when possible to keep receivables low and cash flowing utilize just in time and consignment agreements to keep raw materials at the lowest levels possible to minimize obsolescence produce in process work expediently to cover short term needs build finished goods for firm orders or reasonable short term expectations of sale don t overproduce if in a seasonable business cover production levels over the off season with contracts for sale of goods just before the season cover the risk with orders for goods it may be better to have less than market demand if projections were off compared to interest and carrying costs to hold artificial christmas trees until next year customer lists contacts name recognition trademarks reputation web distribution channels and internet presence are often not considered in asset valuation because they are not carried on the balance sheet these assets however are often worth considerable value in the market place the reasoning for this theory is that these assets can be turned into cash therefore should equal the related value they could generate in return for their sale these intangible assets can produce future sales profits and cash future revenue stream a real value in any company starts with its revenue stream the more you can count on it occurring the more value it has the value becomes the net present value of the after tax free cash flow stream of revenue under contract plus repeat customer base contract backlog is worth much more than revenue that you must locate every year the cost to re create the sale each year is high in terms of time and human energy locate customers where multiple year contract environments can be set up the government often awards contracts for multiple year periods many larger companies favor contract relationships with vendors to reduce the overall cost of screening vendors again and again while not as quantifiable as backlog there is value in a customer base that s been maintained for a long period of time the longer customers remain with a company the more likely they will be loyal in the future when customers stay with an organization this is an indication of the value which they receive from that organization conversely customer turnover indicates their dissatisfaction in the company s ability to provide services for example software companies retain customers and repeat sales with product upgrades and gain new customers with import utilities for easy conversion clearly growth in revenue volume is an indicator of valuation in a company that investors are willing to pay for if customers flock at above industry levels to a company for the services that they provide this is a good indication of the company s ability to perform at above expected levels a motivated sales force with the ability to generate new revenues year after year has more value than a company who has a poor selling reputation a lack of growth indicates that the company does not have an ability to increase its value over time when a company has a great and believable prospectus for the future the buyer will often plan additional capital investment to fuel growth if this case the buyer could be motivated to pay a higher valuation for the company and then invest on top of it going concern value gcv here is where the fun begins in all transactions the going concern value and goodwill or soft assets will always draw the most controversy and discussion in terms of their valuation these elements are most prone to differing interpretation by buyer and seller here to is where you can build the most value into a company transaction value is only at a point in time buyers and investors look more to the company s ability to create additional value to enhance returns on invested capital as they hold their investment impart the elements that future buyers look for businesses that create value consistency is the key you must demonstrate growth in revenue profit and cash flow do everything in your power to eliminate and manage hick ups along the way audited statements go a long way toward verifying results in spite of some recent press high probability of future cash flows a history of positive cash flow at increasing levels is very important true annuity buyers purchase cash flow not the business strategic buyers will value cash flow plus what could happen if additional capital is provided after all free cash flow determines the periodic return on investment and increases the potential for a much higher purchase price in the future management team and human capital attract and motivate a marketing oriented management team with the ability to produce recurring profits return on capital and free cash flow as an annuity for the owners develop an in place stable well trained workforce to implement operating processes on an ongoing basis this is the most valuable off balance sheet asset when the owner of a privately held business has transitioned out and is collecting the net profit and cash without participating in an active management role the value increases dramatically the ability to sell compete distribute produce develop products and thrive this stand alone entity track record demonstrates the viability of the market relationship between the products services offered to meet customer demand and need ability of the company to compete and company reputation in the marketplace the more unique a product is the more value it contributes to the deal the company must be able to differentiate its products and services from the competition even if this is based mainly on perception remember products do have a life cycle and require improvements to remain in demand the directors and management s role must be to build going concern value the gcv can be best maximized with stable leadership setting and following sound strategies to consistently bring products and services to market all the while nurturing resources and implementing processes to manage the company here is where the greatest value resides incentive to purchase create reasons for a buyer to want to consider your company as an acquisition candidate buyers want a fair entry valuation so that they can expect a realistic return potential there must be exit options so that the buyer who buys your business can realize high roi at the time they resell the better the company is at creating stakeholder value and shareholder return the more interest there will be in buying some or all of the stock while investors often buy on hope and promise the dot com market sector collapse clearly indicates a need to ultimately produce returns to substantiate investment think for a moment had many of the dot com managers built gcv to support their promising technologies they might still be around today those that have built gcv have strong balance sheets can weather the storm and will undoubtedly find opportunities to gobble up assets from those who didn t build on any one element in the equation and you increase its individual value build up all elements in the equation and you realize an exponential creation of value to the right buyer the buyer looking for a standalone entity to produce an annuity stream will place the highest value on the company when all components are strong and it operates with little owner intervention buyers looking only for parts of a business to augment their own will want to invest less and only place value on some components regardless of how strong they are for example if you build a strong senior management team but the buyer wants to run the business they will place no value in your senior manager s that will be replaced remember as in field of dreams if you build it they will come about the author john

mexico city first to go was the presidential plane next came the sell off of official helicopters and bulletproof vans then the assault on mexico s golden bureaucracy really took off out went the chauffeur driven cars gone was the private health insurance in just 7 1 2 months mexico s leftist president has achieved the kind of cost cutting revolution that conservatives in washington can only dream of thousands of federal jobs have been eliminated overseas travel has been slashed president andrés manuel lópez obrador even refused to shell out the money last month to fly to the group of 20 summit we can t have a rich government in a poor country he says but what started as a popular attack on official privilege has increasingly generated chaos judges are rebelling over salary cuts public hospitals have canceled surgeries forest fires have blazed out of control for want of more firefighters advertisement the cost cutting is perhaps the clearest sign yet of the radical vision of lópez obrador who won election last year promising a fourth transformation of mexico a shift on the order of the 1910 17 revolution he s no hugo chávez the late venezuelan leader who said capitalism leads us straight to hell lópez obrador backs free trade and promises a balanced budget but he is determined to reorient mexico s government slashing bureaucratic expenses so he can funnel money to other areas including new programs for the poor it s a vision that goes well beyond fiscal austerity said lorenzo meyer a prominent historian here the whole idea of mexico is different said meyer who supports the president lópez obrador who took office in december 2018 still enjoys approval ratings above 60 percent but his budget crusade has revealed a tendency to centralize power worrying some in this country that lived through decades of authoritarian rule advertisement and the mexican government never famous for efficiency risks becoming dysfunctional analysts warn the bureaucracy is not yet collapsing but it s in lousy shape said former foreign minister jorge castañeda a critic of lópez obrador because there s no one there from the start lópez obrador cut a starkly different figure from his predecessor enrique peña nieto was so stylish that the famed beverly hills boutique bijan designed a wristwatch in his honor but his term was stained by scandal including his wife s purchase of a 7 million mansion from a government contractor andres manuel lopez obrador was sworn in as mexican president dec 1 promising a radical change in a country struggling with violence poverty and corruption video reuters after the rumpled lópez obrador won the presidency he invited journalists to peek into his bedroom closet there were just eight suits he s been mocked for his scuffed shoes he s turned the grounds of the presidential palace into a public park and he flies economy slogging through airport lines with all the other poor schleps advertisement he s auctioning off dozens of government airplanes helicopters and vans in a sort of garage sale of privilege several of the aircraft were tied to scandals such as the helicopter that whisked a senior official to his country house in 2015 that kind of abuse was common in a country once run by a spanish colonial elite and later subject to 71 years of one party rule the saying among mexican politicians to live outside the government budget is to live in error lópez obrador is determined to end that he slashed his own salary by around 60 percent to the equivalent of 5 600 a month and it was more than a symbolic gesture his party passed legislation to ensure that federal employees didn t earn more than the president the platoons of aides that once swarmed around senior officials have vanished advertisement lópez obrador s party which holds a majority in the national congress has thrown itself into the austerity campaign with a fervor that would have impressed a medieval franciscan the lower house has whacked 3 000 of its 7 400 jobs said mario delgado the ruling party leader we haven t spent any money on paper delgado said that s because workers discovered 17 storage closets filled with paper he said a sign that someone might have been getting kickbacks in exchange for buying way too many office supplies this month mexico s senate followed the lower house in approving a bill that would cement many of the cost cutting measures into law people got used to wasting government resources delgado said now we need to get used to an austere state but the goal he said isn t to shrink mexico s 300 billion federal budget it s to redirect spending toward other priorities more investment will go to pemex the national oil giant lópez obrador has launched major programs to provide jobs and scholarships for young people and boost pensions for the elderly advertisement so far lópez obrador says he s saved more than 6 billion in government purchases and more than 500 million from canceling bureaucrats private health insurance and savings plans meyer the historian said the plan reflects lópez obrador s desire to change the very relationship between the government and the people he recalled a conversation he had in the early 2000s with lópez obrador then the mayor of mexico city it s hard to change institutions in a few years the mayor said in meyer s telling but lópez obrador promised that when he left office the poor would see the government as theirs share this article share that s a cultural change of historic proportions meyer said of course it has its costs meyer s 35 year old son roman serves in lópez obrador s cabinet as minister of agrarian and urban development he lives with his wife and son in a 1 000 square foot apartment he rides his bike to the presidential office advertisement roman meyer said his ministry has cut about a third of its personnel the austerity forces us to be more creative in redesigning administrative processes he said cheerfully he works 16 hours a day his father is stunned at how small his son s staff is the situation he said is absurd for jaime nieto director of the government owned children s hospital in mexico city the breaking point came in late may already the doctor had suspended overtime dismissed dozens of contract workers and cut back on tests for sick patients his own salary had shrunk by 40 percent now he learned he d have to cancel half of all operations requiring anesthesia i ve worked 40 years at this hospital said the white coated doctor sitting in an office that was dustier than usual due to a new hole in the janitorial budget i ve never lived such a stressful worrying situation advertisement around the country hospitals revolted the head of the social security system quit saying the controls on health spending were inhumane within days the government relented freeing up some funding nieto didn t have to drastically reduce surgeries after all but he still lacks money for nurses and maintenance meanwhile the hospital s internet capacity has been slashed in half everything is still uncertain the doctor said one of the most startling cutbacks has been in international travel government employees were informed in early may that they needed permission from the president s office before taking any trip abroad about two weeks later lópez obrador boasted that he d gotten 100 requests and i only authorized 20 among those denied maria novaro director of mexico s national film institute she was attending the cannes film festival when she got the word she promptly flew home from france advertisement the order sparked panic at the government funded center for scientific research and higher education in ensenada 65 miles south of the u s border researchers there were used to getting academic journals at a post office box in san diego worried they would need presidential authorization for their twice a week mail runs they hired a private courier service the regulation was later eased still the international travel budget for federal workers was cut by 50 percent more than 3 000 scientists and academics have signed a letter to lópez obrador protesting drastic cutbacks at government research centers in some offices energy saving measures are so severe that employees aren t allowed to charge their cellphones this feels like the dismantling of a scientific network that took decades to build said juan martinez a biologist at the institute of ecology but if the scientists reflect one vision of mexico a country with a growing middle class and world class researchers lópez obrador is focused on another he recently defended the austerity program reminding journalists that the indigenous tarahumara in the north were lucky to have a teacher with more than a sixth grade education i want with all my soul and this is why we re taking these measures for poor children to eat before they go to school he said this is equality the government says some of the criticism of its efforts is exaggerated for example some of the institutions protesting the cuts such as the hospital system have had financial problems for years viridiana rios a mexican political scientist said the fundamental problem isn t that the government is wasteful but that it lacks resources mexico s rate of tax collection is among the lowest in latin america and lópez obrador has promised not to raise taxes we are a country that has always benefited the wealthy the result is a tiny skinny state said rios a visiting professor at harvard
economists have dubbed it bad good news an unexpectedly high number of jobs added in june is likely to roil markets and hand federal reserve chairman jerome powell the biggest challenge of his career powell will have a harder time making the case for an interest rate cut when the central bank meets later this month after the government announced that the economy added 224 000 jobs in june compared with the 165 000 expected by economists it becomes harder for the fed to decide if it s appropriate for the fed to cut rates in july daniel zhao senior economist at glassdoor com said after powell obliquely suggested in his most recent remarks that the fed was open to an interest rate cut perhaps as soon as july markets might have relied too heavily on that assumption putri pascualy managing director for paamco prisma said our sense is that bad news is actually good news because that s what the market s anticipating pascualy said softening job numbers open up the door for rate cuts that s been baked in the market she said but today s strong report throws a curveball to that expectation it really complicates their narrative and it s no longer a sure thing that they cut rates this month they may want to wait and see a couple more job reports before they make a move mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the fed chairman will face an unpalatable choice at the central bank s meeting at the end of the month failing to deliver the rate cut that president donald trump has been clamoring for and the market is already expecting could have a seismic effect on wall street there s a very good probability that we ve got to unwind some of this said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute something s got to give to a certain extent in the aftermath of the great recession investors became conditioned to a cycle of dip and rescue with the federal reserve responding to market drops with more accommodative policy it s kind of the playbook that was fashioned out of the crisis every time stocks would go down the fed would step in samana said what the markets might be missing is even though the fed is willing to help out and step in they might not do it as quickly as the market hopes right now investors are treating the prospect of lower interest rates as a kind of cure all pascualy said the crux of all the positive tenor in the market is contingent on one thing which is fed rate cuts that s extremely risky she said the positive is one thing and it has been priced in versus a multitude of negatives that have not been priced in zandi said if it becomes evident that the fed doesn t have enough room to maneuver because rates are historically low to begin with or that rate cuts are unable to stem an exodus of jobs from the economy investor sentiment could plummet if that s the case then the market would turn very sharply he said at this point in the business cycle there s not a lot of room to maneuver so it makes it very difficult for the fed to thread the needle on the flip side if the fed trims interest rates in the absence of clear cut signs of an impending slowdown it risks overheating the economy particularly analysts said if the china trade war does reach a successful resolution the big worry is if china gets solved and the economy really picks up ryan detrick senior market strategist for lpl financial said that can bring back a lot of confidence and business investment although corporate america has been agitating for an end to the tariffs supply chain disruptions and negative sentiment that have inhibited growth since the trade war began a rapid reversal of fortune particularly one taking place in an overly accommodative economic climate could be just as dangerous if the economy starts to pick up and the fed is making cuts maybe inflation could spike quite quickly and business cycles tend to be choked off when you have too much inflation detrick said that s definitely a worry

menafn jordan times how should policymakers in the middle east s gulf states manage their countries large expatriate workforces in saudi arabia foreign nationals account for roughly one third of the population in qatar and the united arab emirates nine out of every 10 residents is an expatriate should these countries governments continue to invest heavily in developing indigenous labour forces with the aim of decreasing dependency on foreign workers the extraordinarily high proportion of foreign labour within the gulf cooperation council gcc countries is often considered problematic because as some see it it threatens local cultures and national identities holds down wages and impedes the development of domestic skills and talent with so many trades and professions dominated by relatively cheap overseas labour the indigenous population is often left with few occupational domains offering competitive wages these tend to be predominantly in the public sector where oil revenues are used to maintain high pay and attractive working conditions but an important dimension of the policy debate within the region risks being overlooked the gulf states large foreign populations are not just workers they are also consumers by inflating the population of the countries in which they live expatriate workers are helping drive economic growth in fact the gcc benefits from a double expat dividend not just a diverse consumer base on the demand side but also a flexible youthful workforce on the supply side as a result following the rapid decline in oil prices of recent years companies could lay off thousands of workers without having to worry about raising the unemployment rate or putting a substantial burden on government coffers this unique feature of gcc labour markets enhances the region s ability to adapt and adjust to fluctuating economic cycles because gcc countries can afford to expand their workforces without running the risk that the share of their elderly population will increase over the long run they enjoy constant young to old and consumer to producer support ratios moreover public and private investments in the region in infrastructure education health and other services has been geared towards the existing consumer base inflated by the expat population those inflows are now causing the gcc population to grow four times faster than in emerging markets and the united states seven times faster than in china and 10 times faster than in the eurozone this trend is expected to continue with annual population growth in the gcc averaging 1 8 per cent twice the average for emerging markets and according to an imf study population growth in the middle east and north africa between 1970 and 2000 has raised the annual rate of growth of output per effective consumer by about 0 5 0 6 percentage points larger consumer markets have sufficient economies of scale and diversity to make the introduction of new products and services into the region economically viable they have the added benefit of generating what the economist amar bhidé calls venturesome consumption demand led entrepreneurship and innovation economies of scale also allow the delivery of health education and other services such as entertainment and leisure at lower prices and larger markets provide a greater incentive for investors and traders to enter and for governments to provide new public goods if not for expat populations in rural and remote areas there would have been little reason to invest in roads schools and hospitals let alone parks libraries and theatres gcc countries have made such investments for the past four or five decades and ongoing construction projects in the gcc are estimated to run in the trillions of dollars in education enrolment in k 12 schools across the gcc rose from 2 7 million in 2003 to 10 7 million in 2012 a compound annual growth rate of 16 5 per cent investment in this sector stands at around 150 billion in health care total spending in the region is expected to increase to 133 billion per year by 2018 the foreign population also provides a human capital dividend to the local population as talented expats introduce knowledge and innovation in sectors that the gcc wants to develop research from mit has shown that an increase in population size is an important driver of technological progress and studies in japan indicate that higher population densities create stronger incentives for individuals to become entrepreneurs a 10 per cent increase in population density increases the share of people who wish to become entrepreneurs by approximately 1 per cent the gcc s expat dividend could grow much bigger but only if governments in the region establish the necessary mechanisms such mechanisms should be designed to maximize the benefits that foreign nationals provide work and retire or invest and retire visas for example would encourage expats to save and accumulate pension funds thereby enabling them to contribute even more significantly to the region s rapid economic growth the writer director of the innovation and policy initiative at insead is the author of black swan start ups

esha mittal talks to virginia state sen siobhan dunnavant who represents 12th senate district follow ambazaarmag sen siobhan dunnavant represents virginia s 12th senate district which includes western henrico and hanover a practicing ob gyn physician the republican is the only doctor serving in the state senate she was first elected to the legislature in 2015 first on behalf of american bazaar i would like to thank you senator dunnavant for taking time to talk to us i have been a young ambassador for the american pain association for the last four years and i am very interested on your sb 726 on cannabidiol cbd oil and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid thc a oil last year you have been viewed as the champion of medical use of cannabis in the commonwealth can you share with us the reasons you support it its current state and future plans it really was not a cornerstone of my legislative agenda when i first came into the senate but when i was running for the primary four years ago it was a question at a forum and the three candidates i was running against all said no no it s a slippery slope to marijuana use i did not really know a lot about marijuana then but i did know that it actually did have therapeutic benefits knowing that the kinds of medications we give prescriptions for even in treatment of chemotherapy that are basically poison i certainly thought that marijuana was not as bad as some of the things we had the ability to prescribe although i was not an expert there was data on it being helpful to patients the year before i got to the senate the original legislation to license pharmacies had gone through but it had to be reenacted my first year to really happen it almost died but i helped bring the bill back to life we had these amazing advocates who were mothers of kids with intractable epilepsy the next year jill vogel one of my fellow senators carried legislation to allow more than just epilepsy be treated by these compounds she asked me to come help her in a house sub committee and explain why this was a good decision to the lawyers the lawyers kept asking about every single medical condition and how it worked and how the cbd or thc oil was valuable i said to them look this is not the way to do it you are not subject matter experts on medical things and literature changes all the time about benefits of these compounds how about we amend the bill and let the doctors decide but they killed the bill i was so frustrated that i told the lobbyists on the way out that next year we would make it so that doctors decide that year once the bill was killed the joint commission on healthcare did a study and said there was no medical value and that there were terrible side effects it seemed to me a very biased study but when we went to the final decision on their recommendation i was somehow able to convince enough people on the committee that we should say that the way to move forward on this was to leave in the hands of the clinicians we had the joint commission recommendation and by the time we went to session in 2018 i had the benefit of that recommendation i was able to get it all the way through the senate all the way through the house and signed with emergency legislation from the governor so that s the whole story and how we got there and know it is just a matter of making sure that the pharmacies are able to compound the substances in the many variety of ways and doses that are necessary to meet the needs of those medical conditions can you describe your bill sb 633 and why you think the bonuses of the state employees should be published on the data point one of my big issues about the state is making sure we are really transparent i think that my fiduciary responsibility at the state level is to make sure that your dollars are spent wisely when we collect them from you transparency is a word that is thrown around so much in medicine we are audited all the time so that was a hard transition for doctors who were used to doing what they thought was best and they were kind of bravado about that but over the last many years so many people look at how we do everything what we do it is put on websites it is just all open and i think that makes us better i think it makes us maybe look for things we would not have thought of and we make sure that we are careful with public bonuses what was happening was that some of the agencies were getting access to money that really was not well tracked and they were awarding bonuses in amounts that nobody knew the whole idea is that if you are a state employee your salary is on the website they were not doing that with additional salaries so the idea that the bonuses are readily open and available makes it so that the state employees will never have to worry about someone accusing them of doing something wrong because everyone will know everything they do let s just be consistent with all the money that is awarded to an individual i am actually very much in favor of incentive bonuses and larger amounts depending on performance we had a big study done at jlarc joint legislative audit and review commission and we are not competitive with the private sector bonuses and rewarding great behavior is where we fall short we re in the process of how we can better compensate our state employees and reward them for great behavior that s what the private sector has done if you can figure out how we can accomplish our goal faster smarter and less expensively we re going to reward you and that s what we should be doing at the state level as a doctor and senator you opposed the medicaid expansion efforts providing health coverage to 400 000 virginians what were your reasons my reasons were that it was kind of a prepackaged idea that pretended it was going to do something but did not really do that one of the major reasons i ran for senate was to make sure i could improve access to healthcare and outcomes of healthcare but this medicaid expansion did not do that the idea that access to health insurance would improve population health has not be shown to be true the idea that we were going to draw down all this money and raise in this artificial way for poverty level did not reach the end point for me it was spending from the federal government that may go away virginia has a balanced budget in the constitution so if that funding goes away i was worried about financial jeopardy for virginia i had an alternative plan and my plan expanded medicaid extensively and includes any mental illness not just severe mental illness so that we could fix this issue between jail hospital and community and get better long term care it would be anyone that had a life threatening medical condition so nobody would be going bankrupt for health needs it also addressed addiction issues it raised general coverage to 100 of the poverty level because we were not there yet the one population that was not included in my plan were the young adults that were childless and healthy so that 18 35 age range with medicaid expansion that was the biggest new enrollment we had mine was paid for by the traditional medicaid spending with a 50 50 split with the federal government instead of 90 10 there were also several other things my plan did that the new plan did not number one is that it covered all of the priority one waivers we have a population of people who have needs and are lumped into priority 1 2 or 3 we have over 3 000 people on the priority 1 list that we did not fund what happened with medicaid expansion is they drew down all this money from the hospitals and the governor took that money and spent it on other things besides healthcare and increasing population health the whole idea of medicaid expansion is that they get to go see a doctor make their overall health better and they don t have health crises that will take them to expensive care this expensive care includes the emergency room the hospital and having a continuity of care the governor and medicaid expansion did not pay for that they reimbursed the hospital at 88 cents on the dollar for medicaid previously the hospitals were at 72 cents they left the doctors that were supposed to prevent health problems primary care doctors nurse practitioners pediatricians psychiatrists and left them at 66 cents on the dollar we paid for all these expensive hospital things but we did not pay to actually improve population health for all those reasons i thought my plan was better my plan left the senate with 40 votes every republican and democrat agreed with my plan that s not true with medicaid expansion it was a bipartisan and problem solving plan that really targeted the populations that needed a safety net that we could fund long term no matter what the federal government does i personally think that medicaid expansion is probably the worst example of big lobbying that i have ever seen people talk about dominion but they re nothing compared to the hospital lobbying medicaid expansion in two years will cost 3 billion 2 million of that money goes to hospitals the idea that i was rejecting helping people is a false narrative in the political arena i actually was very focused on helping people and was looking for something that actually did that rather than just pretend to the sb 631 bill is looking to have a major impact on how community colleges can be valuable in providing more skilled workers to help the commonwealth s economy can you describe this bill for our readers my whole idea is to reduce the cost of education we need to make sure that everyone gets an education that results in a great job happiness and opportunity for them and their families in the future part of that is not duplicating the same thing over and over again and we have some real duplication problems in virginia for one some kids get dual enrollment in high school and they think that is going to count for that class when they get to college they will be able to finish college sooner and will not have to pay for that class that is not how it is working out colleges are rarely accepting the dual enrollment classes if you take english 101 you might get that as an elective but still have to take it when you get to college i m working on fixing it in dual enrollment but this senate bill fixed it at the community college level this made it so that all 23 of our community colleges have the exact same core curriculum and they are developing these outcome measures with all of our four year universities so that every single university will accept every core credit from every community college when i started in the senate people who spent two years in a community college getting that degree still spent four years at a four year university when they went there the whole idea to do 2 years at each school and then be done was not happening lots of my education initiatives focus on getting the right education about 35 of our high school kids leave high school and go to a four year institution and drop out they end up having no credential or license they can market if they go to a credential or licensing program at a community college they can be an electrician and go get their degree later but they do not those are the individuals that have a lot of debt and they cannot pay it because they cannot get a job a lot of our student debt problems are coming from people who maybe should not have gone on to a four year and they should have gotten a different opportunity basically every job in virginia needs more than a high school education but 35 of the high paying jobs do not require a four year university we are not educating that work force because everybody is going to college and then dropping out all of those things are in my eyesight and one of the things i did this year was finalize the assignment of award letters when you get accepted to schools they used to send letters with different language that students would look at sometimes the university language made loans you were going take out look like grants and many kids ended up with more debt than they thought they might have made a different choice for another school or would not have had as much debt three years ago i had our institution of higher education in virginia rewrite protocol for how you write those award letters it was signed by the governor and put into law that all those letters have to look alike so that students understand what they are getting into in a higher education institution how are your preparing for your re election campaign for 2019 and what do you think are the main issues facing district 12 and virginia that will be important for the upcoming november elections we ve been preparing for a long time and one preparation is actually the work i ve done in the legislature i ran because i was tired with where politics were i was tired with the ugly language i was tired with the rhetoric i was tired of people always talking about the same things but not ever offering a solution to the problems it felt like they argued over stuff they never got anything done and all these problems were left unaddressed because they could not get past the arguments the last four years i have kept going in identifying the problems and figuring out a way to solve them in a virtually bi partisan way i always say that democrats and republicans often agree on the problem we just end up at a different solution point if we can go back to the problem and find a new solution point that we agree on we can actually get some things done the first thing is that i ve done what i said i ve problem solved i ve gotten things through and i ve been a very effective freshman senator so i am going to build on that same premise that i am there to use the skill set i have as a physician problem solver at the senate level i am going to be the kind of person that brings people together to get that done and i ve been effective at that my objection to political conversations is even more now than when i ran four years ago i think i am going to keep promoting that i am about positive conversation seeing the good in people and things i ve demonstrated that i work very collaboratively at the legislature and i step aside from that angry rhetoric the other preparation is spending four years in the community this is a full time job and i am out most nights a week even when i am not running for office i am meeting with people listening to them finding out what their needs are and figuring out ways to address those needs in the state legislature i think the two biggest issues in our district are education and healthcare which is where i ve done most of my legislative work it has always been that republicans talk about certain things and democrats talk about others but i do not abide by that structure we need to talk about all problems typically pre school is not something republicans talk about but i carried legislation with democrats to get that done this year cbd is another example i am going to keep this campaign focused on what virginia needs what our problems are how to fix them and i am going to stay away from that nationalized litmus test dialogue because i do not think it does anything but make people angry i am not interested in that i am interested in getting work done as a doctor mother and senator you have inspired so many young people what message do you want to give to our young generations especially girls that really gives me goosebumps i ve spent my whole life empowering women in my office i teach them about how to be healthy i support them when they are emotionally run down i help them get through having their babies marriages and divorces to me one of my most important things is helping people realize how amazing they are at the very center of everything that is important to me every single human being is important and valuable i know people that will treat doctors one way and nurses another way i think you should treat all human beings with dignity and respect for who they are and find what their bright spot is i am going to keep doing that and i want everyone to know they can do that too positivity and joy is a choice and a discipline as much as it is a gift i think that is part of being empowered i hope to continue to include the young generation in shadowing and in coming to the legislature listening to what issues are important to them and showing them that they are that important i hope that we can keep doing that esha

the giant foxconn manufacturing complex planned in wisconsin is likely to continue falling short of the threshold required to begin receiving billions of dollars in state incentives even after production begins next year we understand what is going to be built and when it s going to be finished the first phase gov tony evers told cnbc noting that his administration has now gotten clarity from the taiwanese electronics manufacturer on its plans which are much less ambitious than they were originally portrayed evers spoke exclusively with cnbc in his state capitol office in madison on june 27 one week after paying his first visit to the construction site near racine the site visit was undisclosed to the public until now under the deal negotiated by evers predecessor gov scott walker foxconn said it would build a 10 billion manufacturing complex that president donald trump called the eighth wonder of the world at a groundbreaking one year ago since then no factory has been built but state and local governments already have spent tens of millions of dollars on land acquisition and road and utility improvements the company only recently began laying the foundation for a vastly scaled down manufacturing plant more than a year behind schedule in fact i saw them pouring concrete the other day evers said but the governor said the project s initial phase will employ only about 1 500 people when production begins which is currently scheduled for next may that would be well short of the company s previously announced plans to hire more than 1 800 people by the end of next year the company already has acknowledged that it no longer plans to produce giant glass panels for video displays at the plant using so called generation 10 5 technology for which there are no facilities in the u s instead foxconn will build a generation 6 plant they re going to be making smaller items probably tablets glass for tablets and phones and things like that not the big tvs that they talked about initially evers said foxconn attributed the change to market forces in addition the larger displays would have required an advanced glass plant to be built nearby the leading glass manufacturer new york based corning said it was unwilling to locate a new plant in wisconsin without subsidies but the state was already tapped out foxconn s agreement with the wisconsin economic development corp the state s business development arm calls for the company to create the 13 000 jobs by 2032 the deal calls for the company to do its hiring in phases meeting specific targets in order to qualify for subsidies of around 3 billion the payments are part of a controversial package totaling more than 4 billion in incentives and other assistance the state agreed to in 2017 believed to be the largest such package ever offered to a foreign company in the u s the company s point person in wisconsin told cnbc that its long term goals for the project are unchanged i talked to our corporate and they have reiterated that we are committed to 13 000 jobs said peter buck executive director of the wisconsin valley science and technology park which is what the company and the state have named the development the company already missed last year s target of 260 employees it hired only 156 which meant it forfeited 10 million in credits last year the company has not said whether it will meet this year s minimum of 520 employees to collect as much as 222 million in 2020 the contract requires the company to create at least 1 820 jobs by year s end in order to receive up to 270 million more in credits the disconnect between foxconn s initial promises and reality has been deeply controversial in wisconsin and likely helped evers a democrat defeat walker a republican in last november s election as recently as april evers said the original deal with foxconn was no longer in play and that his administration was renegotiating it at the company s request the comments set off a flurry of activity with trump intervening and foxconn s then chairman terry gou traveling to the white house and to wisconsin on may 1 and 2 to smooth things over gou has since stepped down from the company to run for president of taiwan in the january 2020 election in the interview with cnbc evers first public comments about the project since gou s visit he said specifics of the contract were still under discussion but the clarity he has received has made it more of an ongoing dialogue rather than a one time renegotiation that clarity is important to me that transparency and accountability and protecting the taxpayers has always been a top priority evers said his administration has hired a consultant with industry expertise to monitor the project and is in constant conversation with the company evers said the natural outgrowth of that has been let s have some conversations around the quote unquote deal because it s not going to be what that deal was set up on it s going to be something different evers said backers of the deal including wedc secretary and ceo mark hogan a walker appointee who has announced plans to step down later this year say the experience thus far proves that the contract is functioning the way it was designed and is protecting the taxpayers the contract works they didn t create the jobs it s a performance based contract they don t get the tax credits they understand that hogan told cnbc but that does not address the taxpayer money that already has been spent on the project or the upheaval it has created on what was thousands of acres of rolling farmland 30 miles south of milwaukee under the agreement racine county and the village of mount pleasant where the facility will be located are on the hook for as much as 764 million whether foxconn meets its hiring targets or not as of the beginning of this year nearly 200 million of that already had been paid out mostly for land acquisition while foxconn s factory has yet to rise on the site the area was still a beehive of activity when cnbc visited in june nearby interstate 94 was a giant construction zone it is being widened to eight lanes from six a requirement from foxconn when it was still planning a generation 10 5 plant off the freeway crews were building new roads laying utility and drainage lines and moving tons of dirt orange construction signs pointed the way for wisconn valley trucks the impact extends beyond the neighborhood the village of mount pleasant and racine county both saw their credit ratings downgraded as a result of the money they are spending on the project in its aug 30 report downgrading mount pleasant s bond rating to aa3 from aa2 moody s investors service said the move largely reflects current and anticipated growth in the village s direct debt burden and likely growth in its overlapping debt burden tied to borrowing in support of the foxconn development village officials did not respond to cnbc s request for comment but racine county executive jonathan delagrave said the upfront costs are well worth the benefits foxconn will provide in terms of infrastructure health care and jobs i think it s been a huge huge benefit and there s certainly been a good return on our investment already delagrave told cnbc the ultimate cost benefit analysis of course depends on what foxconn ultimately builds at the site and whether it hires the numbers of people it has promised evers acknowledges the company s commitment to expand beyond 1 500 employees but he will not speculate beyond that well we will take one step at a time he said we ve learned that making sure that things are concrete and discreet and transparent takes some time and we re going to continue to do that
it was only a few years ago that president barack obama and congressional democrats rammed into law a trillion dollar mish mash of government spending taxes and regulations called the affordable care act more commonly known as obamacare the rollout was a mess obama s team couldn t even design a functioning website and it s only been downhill from there alfredo ortiz house dems focus on single payer health care here s what you won t hear millions of americans lost health insurance plans they liked millions more were priced out of the government controlled exchanges and so couldn t afford the promised affordable care at all and most of the people obamacare supposedly helped found themselves not with good insurance but stuck in a medicaid program so dysfunctional that most doctors don t even accept it anymore but if you think this mess might humble democrats confidence in big government and themselves think again today leading liberals are no longer content with politicians and bureaucrats controlling most of the american health care system they want washington to take it all the total federal takeover of the u s medical industry was once the fever dream of socialist extremists like sen bernie sanders i vt but today so called single payer health insurance including the elimination of all private health insurance is the mainstream position of the democratic party it is going to be their platform in the 2020 presidential campaign and their plan as soon as they win back power like most progressive slogans so called single payer health care sounds nice but as health care expert chris jacobs lays out in his new book the case against single payer the reality is worse than the talking points make no mistake single payer health care means politicians and bureaucrats not patients or their families not doctors or nurses or other providers call the shots during the debates about obamacare democrats promised their plan was a compromise that would split the difference between market driven and government controlled health care under single payer health care there is no difference to split it means government pays the doctors and hospital beds pays for the tests pays for the medicine pays for everything that means government not you or your doctor will be calling the shots since there is no upper limit on health care services people might want politicians in charge of single payer systems have to choose whether to bankrupt their countries or ration care they start by raising taxes but it s never enough they always end up rationing care what does that mean it means refusing certain medicines surgeries procedures and services to patients the government deems unworthy of the expense under single payer health care you ll pay more not just for less health care but to be refused care that you need and could otherwise afford you don t have to be an expert to know who this rationing will hurt the most the very young the very old and individuals with disabilities every democratic version of single payer health care would include taxpayer funded abortion on demand indeed they will go a step further and require pro life doctors to perform abortions and other procedures that violate their religious beliefs but single payer health care would not only be morally bankrupt it would be plain old bankrupt too america already faces a 22 trillion national debt former joint chiefs of staff chairman michael mullen has called the debt our biggest national security risk single payer health care is projected to cost a minimum of 32 trillion all by itself just in the first 10 years of implementation such fiscal recklessness would not just swamp the federal budget it could drown our entire economy the left has an almost theological belief in the capacity of government to solve everyone s problems but the history of socialized medicine in canada great britain and elsewhere is that it causes more problems than it solves democrats are right that american health care is too expensive and bureaucratic warps our economy and riddles the federal budget with waste and cronyism but their proposed solution would only double down on these dysfunctions click here to get the fox news app real health care reform requires getting politicians and bureaucrats out of the way they have done enough harm as it is it s time to get health care power out of washington politicians can t solve our health care problems they should hand control of the system back to the patients families and health care providers who can click here to read more by jim demint
if a country doesn t have any babies then in time it won t have an economy but that s not how the central banks see it for the past 20 years through subprime and now their stimulus policies they have believed they could effectively print babies even today they are still lining up to take global interest rates even further into negative territory but common sense tells us their policy cannot work new data shows 2018 births in the g7 richest western countries were just 7 8m this was the lowest level seen since records began in 1921 it was even lower than at the height of the depression in 1933 when births dropped to 7 99m year by comparison during the 1946 70 babyboom they averaged 10 1m year and peaked at 10 6m the chart above confirms the unique nature of the western babyboom births jumped by 15 versus the previous 25 years and since then they have fallen by an average 17 every single country is now having fewer births than at the peak of the boom us births were 3 79m last year versus a peak of 4 29m in 1959 japan had 0 92m versus 2 7m in 1949 germany had 0 79m versus 1 36m in 1963 the babyboom mattered because the boomers were part of the richest society the world has ever seen in 1950 the g7 were half of the global economy and they were still 45 in 2000 the extra babies born during the boom effectively created a new g7 economy the size of canada but since 1970 the west has not been replacing its population as fertility rates have been below 2 1 babies per woman this matters as the second chart shows for the usa the world s largest economy consumer spending is 70 of gdp and it peaks in the 25 54 wealth creator generation when people are building their careers and often settle down and have children spend then drops by over 40 by the age of 75 this didn t matter very much for the economy in the past when most people died around pension age in 1950 for example there were just 130m westerners in the perennials 55 age group by comparison there were 320m wealth creators and 360m under 25 but today there are 390m perennials compared to 515m wealth creators and just 350m under 25s this means it is impossible to recreate the growth of the boomer led supercycle does this matter not really most of us would prefer to have the extra 15 20 years of life that we have gained since 1950 but because policymakers have pretended they could print babies via their stimulus programmes they were able to avoid difficult discussions with the electorate about the impact of the life expectancy bonus now this failure is catching up with them perennials are after all effectively a replacement economy they already own most of what they need and their incomes decline as they move into retirement so we need to adjust to this major change in 1950 it was normal for people to be born and educated before working to 65 and then dying around pension age today we need to add a new stage to this paradigm where we retrain around the age of 55 probably into less physically demanding roles where we can utilise the experience we have gained this would have tremendous benefits for individuals in terms of their physical and mental health and of course it would reduce the burden on today s relatively fewer wealth creators it is completely unfair after all for the boomers to demand their children should have a lower standard of living and instead support their parents in the perennials cohort there is of course one other fantasy peddled by the central banks as part of their argument that monetary policy can always create growth this is that the emerging economies have all now become middle class by western standards and so global growth is still going to power ahead but as the third chart shows this simply isn t true it shows the world s 10 largest economies the circle size ranked by fertility rate and median age only india still has a demographic dividend with its fertility rate just above replacement levels but india s gdp capita is only 2036 brazil s is just 8968 and china s 9608 by comparison the us is at 62606 germany is at 48264 and france uk are at 42600 companies and voters have been completely fooled by these claims of a rising middle class in the emerging economies in reality most people have to live on far less than the official us poverty level of 20780 for a 3 person household in china average disposable income in the major cities was just 5932 last year and only 2209 in the poorer rural half of the country its china s great success has actually been to move 800m people out of extreme poverty income below 1 90 day since 1990 demographics don t lie and they clearly challenge the rose tinted view of the central banks that further interest rate cuts will somehow return us to supercycle days their real legacy has been to create record levels of debt which can probably never be repaid
las cruces sun news these letters were printed in the july 14 print edition of the las cruces sun news an oldie but a goodie in rummaging through some old files i found this letter published in the may 7 2011 print edition of the sun news was i clairvoyant in this time of economic uncertainty many people are experiencing financial personal and political distress and are upset and scared in this context donald trump appeals to a growing number of people what do we see a candidate who is white loud uncompromising rich apologizes to no one and talks in racist code a part of them identifies with him as they cannot do with president obama what folks don t realize is that as far as the middle and working classes are concerned trump does not identify with them or represent them and certainly doesn t support their interests do we deserve this as a candidate let alone a president no jodie marino nachison las cruces america welcomes trump s roaring 20 s as fake news and the meaningless investigations properly failed the libs are now hoping to draw attention in the debates according to most accounts the recent futile debates yielded hopeless candidates speaking almost sincerely of policies trump already fixed years ago spoiler alert trump kept all his promises remember the left field s careless policy fumble at the 1 yard line prior to 2017 was a political career ender now the gdp at an all time high and trump has cleverly kicked that huge economic field goal squarely through the golden uprights of progress americans welcome the roaring 20 s with trump who obviously reaps a second term with great ease and further pence and donald jr can glide the torch to 2040 one credible question is who will the dems wrongly say colludes in the 2020 re election although so many regions have reaped from the mass global impact of proven trumponomics perhaps canada will be credited with colluding this time k a g a folks and check out proverbs 29 2 jim douglass centerville ohio the masses approve the mainstream media labeled president trump s reelection speech dark and fearmongering they criticized his july 4th speech as being sophomoric and 8th grade level the media s hate speech towards donald trump knows no end had president trump delivered lincoln s gettysburg address or king s i have a dream speech he would have been pooh poohed instead of lauded however what really matters is what the american people think since giving his 4th of july speech trump stands at 44 approval rating his highest since assuming office this fact must leave the mainstream media speechless paul hoylen deming little grasp of history facts i was not surprised by ms sanchez s latest paean to the lout in the white house she and his followers must continue to believe least the truth intrudes on their fantasy world she seemed to doubt that the president had lied 10 000 times all she need do is look at the washington post archives which give a listing of these lies she supports a man who has such little grasp of history that he proudly proclaims the us took british airfields during the revolutionary war and that old glory waved oer the ramparts during this war rather than the war of 1812 when it actually occurred claiming that teleprompter failure caused this is simply ludicrous any 12 yea old in this country should know these basic facts apparently not so our self proclaimed stable genius president just today the release of secret cables from the uk ambassador to the united states shows what the world really thinks of this man the ambassador called the president insecure and incompetent and said his entire administration was inept and uniquely dysfunctional so much for respect on the world stage i have no illusion that i will convince ms sanchez or any others of the president s followers to believe the facts having lived in atlanta for many years all i can offer to ms sanchez is a sincere southern bless your little heart steve mclary las cruces something stinks in d c ever notice how we can spend tens of trillions of dollars on warfare and bank bailouts and never hear a whisper about the budget deficit or the national debt most of federal debt is directly traceable to war and banksters however mention spending a fraction of the war and bailout money on healthcare infrastructure education transportation and other services to the non billionaires in our country and all the hand wringers come out of the wall street woodwork we spend about twice the amount per person for medical care as any civilized country with guaranteed healthcare with truly average results we can t afford to reduce our costs to get better coverage our trade treaties destroy our employment opportunities we can t afford to see that everyone has living wage employment our

crisis toxic chemicals best known by the acronym pfas have found their way from the firefighting foams used on cannon and holloman air force bases into our groundwater tragically millions of people across the country drink these cancer causing substances every day but members in congress like rep xochitl torres small have been working hard to bring home much needed money to protect new mexico s drinking water rep torres small worked to include provisions to prevent and clean up pfas contamination in this year s federal budget which recently passed the house 60 million would be used to clean up contamination at military installations like cannon and holloman which has impacted our vital agriculture and dairy industries we have a long way to go before our water is free of pfas but there is no doubt that this funding will make our drinking water safer in the coming weeks congress will also have an opportunity to prevent further contamination by permanently phasing out military use of pfas steps like these bring us closer to the day when nobody has toxic chemicals in their glass cameron reed albuquerque poetry on the border i find the discipline of haiku s classic poetic form of

there is a general rule in finance that things take longer to happen than you would expect but when they do they happen more violently and so it is with the next global downturn everyone worries about it for we all know there is an economic cycle it would be nice if we could get rid of boom and bust as gordon brown thought he had as chancellor but we can t for investors a downturn in america so often a bellwether for the global economy is not yet in sight for investors a downturn in america so often a bellwether for the global economy is not yet in sight the us stock market last week hit a new all time high with the standard poor s 500 index briefly going over 3 000 for uk investors the picture is more clouded for obvious reasons uncertainty about brexit and fear of a corbyn government yet despite uk assets being deeply unfashionable the ftse 100 index is within 4 per cent of the all time peak it hit last year it is easy to see what is pushing shares up the willingness of central banks to keep pumping out money last week s testimony to congress by jay powell chairman of the us federal reserve confirmed that the fed would keep credit flowing and the markets expect a cut in interest rates later this month the european central bank is expected to keep the taps open too and in the bank of england has leeway to cut rates if needed but if it is easy to see what is pushing shares up it is harder to judge what might pull them and the economy down in the past it has often been a sudden rise in inflation driven by higher oil and raw material prices remember the so called oil shocks sometimes it has been wage inflation with tight job markets leading to people demanding and getting higher pay but neither of those looks likely now encouragingly joblessness is at its lowest level since the 1970s in the uk and us despite signs of pay pressures maybe unemployment can go lower still there could be a financial bubble such as the dotcom boom of the late 1990s or the boom in sub prime lending that collapsed in 2008 or a downturn could simply be triggered by bad economic policies the trade war rumblings between the us and china and maybe soon between the us and eu cannot help ultimately though while it would be great to pinpoint the key issue that will send us into a global recession we have to honest and admit we can t we can see warning signs such as weak demand for uk jobs as we report on page 12 and we can make a best guess my own is for a not too serious global downturn starting next year but of this i am sure the longer the downturn is delayed and the more global asset prices are pumped up to keep things moving the harder the bump when we fall better to have a small recession in 2020 than a humdinger in 2022 new car sales are the best immediate indicator of consumer confidence not only are they the biggest big ticket item people buy but also we can probably hang on to the old car if we are worried about our finances so look at this car sales in china the world s biggest market are down 14 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year in india until recently the fastest growing large market they are running down 25 per cent year on year and globally according to germany s centre for automotive research they are likely to be down 4 million the largest fall since 2008 uk car sales are down only 3 4 per cent in the first half of this year if you are in the motor trade this is a disaster there are stories of desperate dealers in china offering bogofs buy one get one free a supermarket trick to bump up sales but from global perspective well maybe the downturn noted above is gathering pace we should always be careful of political scare stories but the first evidence of damage to the economy from fears of a corbyn government came last week the 2 billion sale of electricity north west which delivers electricity and gas across the uk was abandoned the reason labour renationalisation plans if you say you will nationalise companies without full compensation don t expect investors to knock at your door

penalties cassity s associate former bank president james jeffries had already pleaded guilty to failing to report a letter of credit he signed for a company that he and cassity owned the investigation revealed that cassity was involved in at least 138 businesses the u s attorney said cassity admitted in court that while serving as a board member and legal counsel for empire bank he did not obtain prior consent from other board members before issuing letters of credit from empire bank on behalf of companies he had ownership interest in i didn t and i suppose you sort of feel the good ends justify the means cassity said in court i did it at a time i was not how would you say it watching the law as good as i should cassity told a federal judge he was not certain whether he knew at the time that letters of credit had to be reported by law but after repeated questioning and conferring with his lawyer in a whisper said i knew it was a violation of the law in return for the guilty plea the government agreed not to seek further criminal charges against cassity in connection with his activity as an empire bank officer or counsel from 1975 onward the government also agreed not to seek additional charges against cassity in connection to income tax returns he prepared for limited partnerships and businesses from 1975 through 1979 jan 29 1982 cassity was by then referred to as a former springfield attorney in the pages of the news leader a federal judge in kansas city ordered cassity to serve six months of a two year sentence plus three years of probation and 20 hours per week of community service for a year to be served at the national juvenile law center in st louis my client is an extraordinary individual cassity s chicago based attorney said in court he was consumed by a desire to succeed aside from a death sentence the worst possible thing that could have happened to him is this failure he already has experienced in front of his kids and in front of his friends cassity s attorney also urged the judge to place cassity on probation and order community service rather than have him spend time in prison mr cassity has never been a burden on society and i submit it would be wrong to make him a burden on society for even one day terry grimm said he has offered to pay back the money involved and he has been asked by two agencies that he has helped to come work for them cassity told the news leader i hope that the 6 month prison sentence will serve as some sort of example that you can t stretch yourself too thin when you don t have the proper time and resources to take care of things cassity also agreed to surrender his law license a requirement because of the felony convictions jan 30 1982 the news leader reported that some who invested in ventures managed by cassity were angered by the sentence that emerged following the plea deal i think it s an example of token punishment said one springfield physician who formerly did business with cassity it borders on being an affrontery to those who have been injured by this man some irrevocably injured a local psychiatrist said i don t think he s serving enough time for the misery he caused a lot of people and the burdens he put on a lot of people i m not surprised that he was sentenced to something that seems rather light said a third investor penalties for white collar crime seem to be that way the u s attorney who made the plea deal with cassity assured news leader readers that the government is committed to fighting white collar crime saying how people interpret this sentence will not affect the commitment on the part of the executive branch and specifically the u s attorney s office in pursuing white collar crime feb 12 1982 a wichita kansas bank sued empire bank seeking payment of 100 000 on a 1976 loan made to cassity cassity and an associate failed to pay any of the note back the kansas bank alleged empire bank no longer tied to cassity by that time refused to pay

a 1992 audit found that 13 5 million should have already been held in trust state officials also complained that nps was not always cooperative with auditors and monitors cassity has denied any involvement other than occasional consulting services to nps since the early 80s the news leader reported but records from 1993 showed that 88 3 percent of nps was owned by an entity called rbt trust ii the trust s beneficiaries were cassity s wife and two sons through their controlling interest in nps the cassity family also controlled three texas based insurance companies that insured or reinsured nps pre need funeral plans and nine funeral homes through an entity called cassity national heritage foundation cassity s son brent cassity was president nps s attorney howard wittner said he was thrilled by the 20 million settlement it ratifies everything my client does it brings to an end the most ridiculous ludicrous piece of litigation i ve seen in 35 years may 18 1994 news leader opinion columnist chris bentley wrote about the july 1994 issue of traditional home magazine a glossy from the publishers of better homes and gardens the cover and 11 pages inside focus on an opulent mansion in the st louis area where former springfield lawyer doug cassity and his wife rhonda live bentley wrote he wrote that he bet a lot of people in springfield will be furious once they saw the

bed a custom made dressing table a victorian needlepoint chair antique children s collectibles many of which were treasures picked up on travels the family cats even had their own delightful kitty cottage traditional home which reportedly did not mention cassity s stint in federal prison also wrote that the home was a place where rhonda s lifelong quest for domestic graciousness would eventually blossom a line that earned scorn from the news leader s bentley if the writing style isn t enough to make you sick the subject matter likely will have you seeing red because you may have helped pay doug cassity s utility bill in springfield bentley wrote cassity s 82 000 bill dating back to 1980 had not been paid as of may 1994 bentley reported adding interest a cu attorney said it had climbed over 100 000 by that time cassity continued to have no assets in his name so cu was unable to collect from him guess who paid the bill everybody else in the words of cu s lawyer i ought to get one of those magazines he said maybe we ought to get cassity down here again in court and let him explain some of this again may 26 1994 cassity s son brent cassity responded to bentley s column about the cassitys st louis area manse with a letter to the editor characterizing the column as journalism run amok a deliberate hurtful and seemingly vengeful personal attack on my mother nov 25 2010

lawyer said mr cassity has been waiting to confront this in court line by line item by item he feels confident that he can and he intends to do so
president trump is putting his hopes for reshaping the federal reserve on a controversial conservative economist who is a fierce advocate for his economic agenda and who has adjusted her views on monetary policy to fit the commander in chief s after several derailed attempts to stock the independent central bank with allies trump announced last week that he intends to nominate former campaign adviser judy shelton and christopher waller executive vice president at the federal reserve bank of st louis to two open spots on the fed board of governors mosads waller a career academic is seen as a safe and independent choice that won t carry trump s water but shelton s selection may be trump s most viable chance to sway the direction of the fed after republicans rejected his past efforts fill the bank with loyalists if shelton is confirmed and trump wins re election she d be an immediate front runner to replace fed chairman jerome powell when his term expires in 2022 she s echoed trump in a series of op eds and interviews from the president s washington d c hotel calling on the fed to cut interest rates to support financial markets and trump s trade agenda critics of shelton say she s as political as stephen moore and herman cain two trump allies floated for the fed board by the president earlier this year who were rejected by gop senators shelton has also been panned for her past support of a gold standard and global currency union two ideas with almost no support in either party few if any democrats are likely to support shelton which means just four of the 53 senate republicans can sink her nomination but unlike moore and cain there are factors working in shelton s favor that could help garner support among gop senators shelton has already been confirmed by the senate for her current role as u s executive director at the european bank for reconstruction and development she also lacks the baggage brought to the vetting process by cain who has denied four allegations of sexual misconduct and moore who wrote several misogynistic columns over decades as a pundit the problems that moore and cain had were not for the most part related to their economic thinking said ian katz director at political and policy intelligence firm capital alpha partners her issues are more closely tied to actual economics and monetary policy so that makes it at least a little less complicated than things were for moore and cain republicans have expressed little concern about how her closeness to trump or unpopular opinions could influence the fed you wouldn t want the entire board to be made up of those people said sen kevin cramer r n d a senate banking committee member who opposed cain s nomination but diversity of thought is what makes a good deliberative body and their independence does not require neutrality sen john kennedy r la another banking panel member said shelton s evolution on interest rates is simply what good economists do they change their suggested remedies based on symptoms and the condition of the economy kennedy told reporters tuesday i don t know a single economist who knows an economic textbook from an ll bean catalog that says under all circumstances no matter what the economy is doing that you should raise rates every time you have a meeting or vice versa trump s ongoing war against the fed has forced republicans to walk a careful line between supporting the president and the bank s independence most gop senators are generally pleased with powell a republican and don t share trump s vitriolic views of his hand picked fed chief i think done a very good job within the fed the fed is supposed to be independent i think he s done that said sen mike rounds r s d a banking panel member rounds added that trump s criticism is a healthy give and take explaining that trump wants the same thing we all do which is a really strong economy and he s going to lobby hard for whatever he thinks works for the economy while republicans generally cede that trump has a right to rip the fed they ve rejected his most overt threats to its independence after sinking trump s planned nominations of moore and cain the gop demanded closer coordination on future picks with the white house shelton s name has circulated for months as a potential fed pick and top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said tuesday that he s met with members of the senate banking committee to gauge support for her nomination they let that name float out there for a while before nominating her so i would take that to mean that there isn t very big significant enough senate republican opposition to derail her katz said but katz added that shelton faces a narrow path toward confirmation that depends on successfully quelling concerns about her evolving and unconventional ideology shelton like trump had criticized the fed under former chair janet yellen for keeping interest rates close to zero while the economy recovered from the 2008 recession she then flipped her views on monetary policy after trump s election calling on the fed to cut rates despite solid economic growth and unemployment near record lows in a wednesday op ed for the washington post shelton insisted that her positions on interest rates reflect her view that it is important to be able to include the fed in discussions of how best to safeguard financial stability and promote productive economic growth questioning the fed s infallibility in making monetary policy decisions should not be interpreted as an attack on its independence but rather an honest effort to stir much needed debate shelton wrote kudlow also rejected accusations that shelton has flip flopped or holds views too on the fringe for the fed there s no way that judy shelton is radical there s just no way kudlow told reporters monday god forbid anybody should change their forecast i mean c mon democrats have rolled their eyes at such defenses and insist shelton s conspicuous turn toward supporting cheap money under republicans is proof she would be little more than a crony for trump at the fed sen sherrod brown d ohio ranking democrat on the senate banking committee said shelton s is unqualified and political as the two that collapsed because of republican opposition referring to cain and moore she s changed her positions on everything she s auditioned for this job by speaking through media to trump brown told reporters tuesday she brings into question the independence of the fed
atlanta victor idaho as federal reserve chair jerome powell kept the focus on global risks that could trigger a fed rate cut in coming weeks his colleagues from regional fed districts painted a rosier picture of continued u s economic growth and a solid business outlook reuters reported the contrasting remarks show the dilemma the fed faces as it heads toward an end of month monetary policy meeting now broadly expected to end with a rate reduction on one hand emphasized by powell in congressional hearings wednesday and thursday and seconded by the influential chief of the new york fed and fed governor lael brainard global trade and economic risks have put a dent in investment inflation is well below the fed s 2 percent target and the u s expansion may need a shot in the arm but as they polled businesses in their districts atlanta federal reserve bank president raphael bostic and richmond federal reserve bank president thomas barkin saw an economy still humming and no clear need for the fed to ease monetary policy i am not seeing the storm clouds actually generate a storm yet said bostic who described himself as skeptical of the need to cut interest rates right now with very few exceptions businesses are telling me the economy is performing as strong as it was they are not seeing weaknesses in consumer engagement and they are not materially changing their plans i ve been out in the last couple weeks and i m talking to business people barkin said on thursday they are not yet leaning back they are not cutting jobs they are not cutting investments that have already been underway but they are cautious they haven t stopped they ve just slowed more detail about on the ground business sentiment may come next week when the fed releases its latest beige book compendium of anecdotal information from the 12 fed districts powell has pointed to a number of national surveys as evidence business confidence took a hit recently particularly in may after president donald trump threatened to impose tariffs on mexican imports unless his demands about tougher immigration enforcement were met the tariffs were not levied but it was a bit of a confidence shock powell told the senate banking committee in albany new york thursday new york fed president john williams added his voice in support of a rate cut citing uncertainties around trade and global growth and soft inflation the arguments for adding policy accommodation have strengthened over time brainard in a separate appearance in scranton pennsylvania piled on taking into account the downside risks at a time when inflation is on the soft side would argue for softening the expected path of monetary policy according to basic principles of risk management she told a community banking group neither barkin nor bostic have a vote this year on the fed s rate setting committee but they will participate in the debate when the fed meets in three weeks in a session widely expected to reduce the fed s overnight target interest rate by at least a quarter of a percentage point investors expect that cut with near 100 percent certainty powell in appearances on capitol hill this week bolstered expectations such a cut is coming and focused on the need to protect the united states against fallout from a weak global economy neither barkin nor bostic ruled out supporting a rate cut which according to minutes of the fed s june meeting has drawn support for a variety of different reasons both the global tensions powell has focused upon as well as weak inflation and a sense that the fed had unintentionally set policy too tight with its four interest rate increases last year at least a couple regional fed bank presidents do support a rate cut including st louis fed bank president james bullard and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari who on thursday said he is advocating the stronger medicine of a half percent rate cut both men say a rate cut is needed to boost inflation expectations but other regional bank presidents have in recent days said they were struggling to justify lower rates at a time when unemployment is near a historic low at 3 7 percent and job growth continues apace bostic said that even recent weak inflation data may not be as worrisome as it might seem with the fed s current preferred measure of inflation running at 1 6 percent below the 2 percent target some policymakers argue the central bank needs to do more or risk losing public trust that it takes the target seriously if the public comes to believe that a persistent downside miss to the 2 percent goal means the fomc is not committed to that goal then there is a problem bostic said but he added that his analysis of inflation expectations based on surveys of professional forecasters and business executives left him unconvinced that expectations are slipping in addition less noisy measures of actual inflation which strip out the most volatile terms indicate that right now we are very close to our 2 percent price stability mandate
shenzhen china between baskets filled with hard drives memory sticks led lights and countless other bits of technology hardware jason gui found what he was looking for a handful of tiny batteries his business partner tiantian zhang whipped out her phone to pay for them via wechat the all in one messaging and payments app ubiquitous in china and transferred about 4 yuan or 0 60 for each battery the bustling wholesale market with its rows of vendors is part of huaqiangbei a subdistrict in the chinese city of shenzhen that has become known as the silicon valley of hardware for gui it s better than that silicon valley was a little bit slow for us gui said over his workstation at hax a startup incubator in shenzhen if you were to do this in the u s you would just be importing the same materials from china anyway gui 28 and zhang 30 are known as haigui or sea turtles a term for foreign educated chinese people who have returned to china about 80 percent of chinese students who get degrees abroad now go back up from about 33 percent in 2007 according to china s ministry of education some 15 percent take jobs in china s booming tech sector that has implications for the united states with experts worrying that as china turns more attractive for talent the u s will lose out if there are talented people who would be willing to stay we need to keep them said james lewis of the center for strategic and international studies a washington think tank lewis added that uncertainty over immigration has made that harder just as china has put a huge effort into enticing these students back from silicon valley to shenzhen gui and zhang returned to china to start their company vue after graduating from the university of pennsylvania in 2013 along with an american co founder aaron rowley they make smart glasses that track wearers activities and connect to their smartphones to play music and accept calls cheap and ample products make it possible for them to iterate quickly turning a prototype into a finished product in a matter of days gui and zhang initially moved to san francisco after graduation but they accomplished less in a year there than they did in a three month trip to shenzhen gui s and zhang s office sits just upstairs from the sprawling market and their factory is an hour s drive away that proximity has saved them time and money and the pace is faster in shenzhen gui said people work really hard until really late he said more on msnbc s on assignment with richard engel made in china sunday at 10 p m et china s tech sector has its own shorthand to describe the hours that employees work in the country 9 9 6 meaning from 9 a m to 9 p m six days a week our factories are still talking to us at 10 p m or 11 p m sometimes well into midnight they re working on weekends so things get done much faster gui said whereas back in san francisco after 5 p m people won t respond to your emails and you can t get anything done until the next day you can t do that in the valley china s startup scene also offers entrepreneurs the chance to do more with their funding thanks to lower resources and labor costs wang meng qiu a startup founder who graduated from stanford university with a doctorate in computer science held jobs at facebook and twitter in silicon valley before he moved to the outskirts of shanghai to launch his own drone company zero zero robotics wang said the salaries of his 40 person team for two years cost 700 000 you can t do that in the valley he said the pay discrepancy between silicon valley and china has narrowed since he launched in 2014 especially at top tier firms wang s engineers now make 70 percent to 80 percent of what they could get in america that has helped him poach other u s educated engineers a decade ago if you were a computer science whiz the only place you could make a good buck was in the u s wang said but now chinese companies are making comparative or even more attractive offers than those in america if he had wanted to pursue a career in academia wang said he would have stayed in america but to build products and achieve commercial success china s know how available capital and massive consumer base won out we re not as fast in fundamental research or core innovations but in the area of technology application i think we re actually leading the world he said referring to chinese advances in e commerce messaging and mobile payments market fit a similar rationale guided wang yi who graduated from princeton university with a doctorate in computer science in 2009 after a stint at google in san francisco he got the itch to build his own software product an app for language learners that offers personalized instruction wang said he wanted a huge market and proven user demand china fit the bill its middle class is expected to reach 550 million by 2022 according to consulting company mckinsey the share of per capita education spending among chinese 20 year olds is about twice that in the u s yi now lives in shanghai and runs lingochamp or liulishuo the app he launched in 2012 with two other silicon valley expats it claims to be the world s largest bank of chinese speakers with more than 80 million registered users operating in china hasn t stopped yi from wanting to build a presence in america lingochamp went public on the new york stock exchange last year the same goes for wang of zero zero robotics half of the company s orders come from america but wang said he s in no rush to move back china just offers more opportunities he said

when a dozen of conservatism s best minds take on socialism and expose it for the utopian fraud it is attention must be paid in a brief foreword to a special issue of national review editor in chief richard lowry admitted that many conservatives thought socialism in america had been vanquished after the collapse of soviet communism 30 years ago but as t s eliot insisted there is no such thing as a lost cause because there is no such thing as a gained cause the experts examine socialism in its many guises beginning with charles cooke s blunt assessment that socialism is not and never can be democratic cooke the editor of nationalreview com writes that voters should not be fooled by the left s attempt at rebranding there is no sense in which socialism can be made compatible with democracy as it is understood in the west at worst says cooke socialism eats democracy and is swiftly transmuted into tyranny at best socialism stamps out individual agency places civil society into a straitjacket of uniform size and turns representative government into a chimera cooke s description of socialism as tyrannical was confirmed by ugo okere a socialist candidate for the chicago city council who explained that democratic socialism to me is about democratic control of every single facet of our life that would mean presumably rewriting the first words of the constitution to something like we the people of the united states in order to form a more democratically controlled union what has okere s democratic control produced in the socialist paradise of venezuela ricardo hausmann the former chief economist of the inter american development bank has written that venezuela s economic catastrophe dwarfs any in the history of the u s western europe or the rest of latin america how catastrophic under chavez maduro socialism the child mortality rate has increased 140 ninety percent of venezuelans now live in poverty this year inflation will hit an unbelievable 10 million percent that is not a typographical error all this in a country with the world s largest proven oil reserves far greater than those of the united states cooke concludes his essay with lessons learned from 6 000 years of civilization including never relinquish the right to free speech the right to free conscience the right to freedom of religion the right to bear arms or the right to a jury trial whatever you do he warns don t be seduced by socialists bearing promises but if you are seduced get out before it s too late you have nothing to lose but your chains the distinguished author joshua muravchik a fellow at the world affairs institute takes a historical approach to the myths of socialism he writes that the initiator of soviet terror tyranny and violence was its founding father vladimir lenin who exhorted his followers to exert merciless mass terror against kulaks priests and white guards persons of doubtful standing should be locked up in concentration camps i e the gulag to what end not just to accumulate political power but in pursuit of a sacred mission a socialist world when the farmers resisted collectivization lenin s successor josef stalin engineered a famine in which at least 5 million and perhaps as many 10 million starved to death the holodomor if stalin was a tyrant of stupefying brutality writes muravchik he was outdone by communist rulers mao zedong whose cultural revolution resulted in at least one million deaths and pol pot who wiped out one fourth of cambodia s population in his attempt to emulate mao why did they kill so many muravchik provides the answer it was their devotion to an ideal that prompted them to slaughter millions of unresisting innocents economist jeffrey tucker begins with the damning comment among the most conspicuous of socialism s failings is its capacity to generate vast shortages of things essential for life in maoist china he points out there was no meat and no fat in which to cook anything in bolshevik russia there was never enough housing or food not even loaves of bread what happened when nikita khrushchev took over as soviet leader following stalin s death in 1953 he and his colleagues tried desperately to cobble together a system of planning that made sense without relying on bourgeois market forces they failed miserably in tucker s words khrushchev spent his last years as a discredited dejected and sad old man on a park bench if you love deprivation constriction and general limits on material aspirations says tucker plus a tyrannical ruling class that oppresses everyone else you will love what socialism can and does achieve indeed he concludes misery seems to be its only contribution to economic history socialists says national review correspondent kevin williamson are guilty of a fatal conceit they think they can develop a system so powerful that it can consider every variable in society and propose scientific answers about how many acres of potatoes to plant and when and where to plant them but free market economists ludwig von mises and f a hayek a nobel laureate showed that complete knowledge was not attainable on social economic or political questions therefore says williamson the more intelligent and non ideological governments have largely given up on central planning even the nordic social democracies so dear to the self styled socialists of the united states mostly have been divesting themselves of state enterprises reasonably successful state run enterprises such as the swiss railroads have been converted into stock corporations or reformed in other market oriented ways the subtitle of hayek s last work the fatal conceit is the errors of socialism sen bernie sanders i vt and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y have failed to learn from those errors says williamson asserting that you cannot call yourself the party of science and the party of socialism too you have to choose one or the other socialists flaunt their compassion argues former national review editor in chief john o sullivan because it gives them an excuse to impose their will on others unlawfully and even murderously modern socialists tend to disapprove of placing conditions on aid to the poor workfare viewing the receipt of aid as an unqualified right that sounds generous says o sullivan but it traps the poor in long term dependency and undermines what the scholar shirley letwin calls the vigorous virtues among their neighbors before a single socialist regime had established itself says o sullivan 19th century writers like fyodor dostoevsky w h matlock and rudyard kipling saw the horrors that lay concealed within socialism s humanitarian promise their examination of country after country refutes the fraying excuse that socialism has never been tried in the later stages of soviet communism for example a woman would sell herself for a pair of jeans in venezuela today people exchange family heirlooms for a little food although the french welfare state is often offered as a shining example of progressivism pascal emmanuel gobry a fellow at the ethics and public policy center declares you must look at actual france not the fantasy france of progressive propaganda he challenges the french elite who believe they have the right to order society for the benefit of everyone given the results of their leadership low growth mass unemployment social strife and a general mood of pessimism gobry suggests that they might want to rethink their idea of progress bt before thatcher the great britain of the 1970s was generally described as the sick man of europe due to its prolonged experiments with statism and the pervasive stagnation they produced in 1960 according to historian andrew stuttaford the u k boasted europe s most productive economy but that was before the labour party came to power and nationalized almost every industry in sight the mid 1970s were hard on most western economies but the u k appeared to be in a hell of its own says stuttaford inflation shot up 300 gross domestic product fell unemployment rose the pound crumbled industry buckled and some of britain s best and brightest headed for the exit the winter of 1978 was characterized by grotesque images the dead unburied the sick untreated the trash piling up in the streets just months later promising radical change margaret thatcher walked into 10 downing street and proceeded to denationalize coal steel and utilities bring down inflation spur economic growth and refuse to give into organized labor s draconian demands her message the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people s money markets not bureaucrats are better for the environment asserts shawn regan a fellow at the property and environment research center pointing out that eastern europe and the soviet union were the most polluted and degraded places on earth he quotes the economist murray feshbach and journalist alfred friendly jr as writing that when historians conduct an autopsy of soviet communism they may reach the verdict of death by ecocide closer to home says regan the attempts of cuban socialists to maximize production at all costs has caused extensive air soil and water pollution in venezuela socialist policies have contaminated drinking water supplies fueled rampant deforestation and caused frequent oil spills the principal guilty party is the state owned energy company
it s no secret that foes of the united states including venezuela iran russia and china are experimenting with cryptocurrency technology as they seek to render their economies immune to crippling us sanctions however a new study from the foundation for defense of democracies fdd exposes the lengths to which these rogue nations are willing to go to make this a reality for decades u s adversaries have been trying to evade and undermine this power but there has been no way to conduct significant international commerce without moving through the pipes of the u s led global financial system now however new pipelines are being built the foundation for defense of democracies fdd stated in the study weaponizing crypto to resist us economic pressure iran venezuela russia and china four us foes affected by or constantly at risk of us sanctions go beyond mere sanctions evasion and develop alternative global commerce payments systems outside of us influence via blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies the study reads according to the fdd while they are exploring the development of their own state backed crypto china iran and venezuela also restricted access to the public cryptocurrencies that are currently available on the market russia iran and venezuela have initiated blockchain technology experiments that their leaders paint as tools to offset u s financial coercive power and increase sanctions resistance china is also wary of u s financial power and the ever present threat of sanctions against chinese officials the researchers stated venezuela s blockchain mess serves as a case study but these endeavors have met with mixed success as nicolas maduro s government failed to build the economic and technical infrastructure for venezuela s state backed cryptocurrency the petro is useful to neither the south american country s citizens nor its trading partners the fdd argues instead the researchers deemed petro more of a propaganda effort than a technical or financial accomplishment however venezuela s case with its government backed crypto should serve as an example for other us foes who are planning to develop their own digital currency according to the fdd the petro s shoddy implementation provided little more than a vehicle for regime propaganda rather than any technical or economic utility and yet iran russia and even china are likely to learn from venezuela s missteps the study reads russia s regional crypto iran s swift alternative and china s blockchain research while venezuela has failed to get its so called cryptocurrency off the ground the other three us adversaries are working hard to create their own crypto and blockchain based economies according to the fdd russia seeks to lessen the impact of us sanctions by focusing on blockchain technology and including it as a long term national security and economic goal with the goal of facilitating trade and investment outside the grip of the united states russian financial institutions are running multiple blockchain pilots the country s ministry of finance is also planning to develop a regional crypto with other members of the eurasian economic union eaeu as iran has been hit hard by sanctions bringing its crude oil export to a historic low the country s government is looking to create an alternative to swift the fdd stated the trump administration will add more sanctions to iran because iran breached the nuclear agreement that the us is no longer party to make sense to you medea benjamin medeabenjamin july 11 2019 according to the study iran is investing heavily in blockchain development with plans to create a national cryptocurrency which would be used for domestic transaction settlement another crypto is in the works in iran by the startup kuknos in which the organization seeks to develop a gold backed digital currency called peyman that four iranian banks would use initially to tokenize assets in the fiat world aiming to neuter the usd as a global reserve currency and displace the us in the global financial system china devotes much of its resources to blockchain research as well as developing a national state backed cryptocurrency of all u s adversaries china is best positioned to develop blockchain based digital currency infrastructure that could compete with the dollar based financial system the study says in addition to its state backed crypto development the people s bank of china pboc and chinese authorities are researching blockchain s use for credit finance and real estate projects as well as a blockchain powered securities trading platform the us must take the lead in the crypto race with venezuela iran russia and china building their blockchain sanctions resistance it is crucial for the us to be in a leading position during the international crypto race the researchers argue they say the united states needs to ensure that blockchain projects are developed in a way that will

atlanta victor idaho as federal reserve chair jerome powell kept the focus on global risks that could trigger a fed rate cut in coming weeks his colleagues from regional fed districts painted a rosier picture of continued u s economic growth and a solid business outlook reuters reported the contrasting remarks show the dilemma the fed faces as it heads toward an end of month monetary policy meeting now broadly expected to end with a rate reduction on one hand emphasized by powell in congressional hearings wednesday and thursday and seconded by the influential chief of the new york fed and fed governor lael brainard global trade and economic risks have put a dent in investment inflation is well below the fed s 2 percent target and the u s expansion may need a shot in the arm but as they polled businesses in their districts atlanta federal reserve bank president raphael bostic and richmond federal reserve bank president thomas barkin saw an economy still humming and no clear need for the fed to ease monetary policy i am not seeing the storm clouds actually generate a storm yet said bostic who described himself as skeptical of the need to cut interest rates right now with very few exceptions businesses are telling me the economy is performing as strong as it was they are not seeing weaknesses in consumer engagement and they are not materially changing their plans i ve been out in the last couple weeks and i m talking to business people barkin said on thursday they are not yet leaning back they are not cutting jobs they are not cutting investments that have already been underway but they are cautious they haven t stopped they ve just slowed more detail about on the ground business sentiment may come next week when the fed releases its latest beige book compendium of anecdotal information from the 12 fed districts powell has pointed to a number of national surveys as evidence business confidence took a hit recently particularly in may after president donald trump threatened to impose tariffs on mexican imports unless his demands about tougher immigration enforcement were met the tariffs were not levied but it was a bit of a confidence shock powell told the senate banking committee in albany new york thursday new york fed president john williams added his voice in support of a rate cut citing uncertainties around trade and global growth and soft inflation the arguments for adding policy accommodation have strengthened over time brainard in a separate appearance in scranton pennsylvania piled on taking into account the downside risks at a time when inflation is on the soft side would argue for softening the expected path of monetary policy according to basic principles of risk management she told a community banking group neither barkin nor bostic have a vote this year on the fed s rate setting committee but they will participate in the debate when the fed meets in three weeks in a session widely expected to reduce the fed s overnight target interest rate by at least a quarter of a percentage point investors expect that cut with near 100 percent certainty powell in appearances on capitol hill this week bolstered expectations such a cut is coming and focused on the need to protect the united states against fallout from a weak global economy neither barkin nor bostic ruled out supporting a rate cut which according to minutes of the fed s june meeting has drawn support for a variety of different reasons both the global tensions powell has focused upon as well as weak inflation and a sense that the fed had unintentionally set policy too tight with its four interest rate increases last year at least a couple regional fed bank presidents do support a rate cut including st louis fed bank president james bullard and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari who on thursday said he is advocating the stronger medicine of a half percent rate cut both men say a rate cut is needed to boost inflation expectations but other regional bank presidents have in recent days said they were struggling to justify lower rates at a time when unemployment is near a historic low at 3 7 percent and job growth continues apace bostic said that even recent weak inflation data may not be as worrisome as it might seem with the fed s current preferred measure of inflation running at 1 6 percent below the 2 percent target some policymakers argue the central bank needs to do more or risk losing public trust that it takes the target seriously if the public comes to believe that a persistent downside miss to the 2 percent goal means the fomc is not committed to that goal then there is a problem bostic said but he added that his analysis of inflation expectations based on surveys of professional forecasters and business executives left him unconvinced that expectations are slipping in addition less noisy measures of actual inflation which strip out the most volatile terms indicate that right now we are very close to our 2 percent price stability mandate
if you are driving in fog ice or snow the most important rule is to keep your distance it s rule number one two three and up to ten this was said to me by the kind person taking us to zurich airport today he was referring to driving in winter weather here for me it captured perfectly the dilemmas facing the federal reserve as it decides by how much it should cut interest rates at the end of this month yes it s not a question of whether they will cut but by how much while the us economy faces cross currents it remains in a good place using two of chairman powell s favorite descriptors that is domestic economic momentum is able at least for now to overcome headwinds from slowing growth in the rest of the world trade policy uncertainties and increasing currency tensions yet judging from fed chairman powell s remarks to congress last week the world s most powerful central bank is on the verge of cutting rates thereby also opening the door for central banks elsewhere to ease their monetary policies u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell said wednesday that crosscurrents such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth have been weighing on the u s economic activity and outlook photo by liu jie xinhua via getty it s hard to justify a rate cut using traditional metrics the unemployment rate is at a five decade low inflation is not that far below the fed s target financial conditions are the loosest in almost two decades stock indices are at record highs and interest rates are already at low levels yet the fed is under tremendous market and political pressure to cut and it will do so citing the concept of an insurance cut that is increasing monetary stimulus now in order to reduce the risk of future damage but like most insurance you and i get the one the fed will embrace is not free for four main reasons the more the central bank does now the less room it will have to cut later if domestic economic momentum wanes remember the current us economic expansion is already an unusually long one having also set a new record less month the greater the policy easing the stronger the signal to investors and traders to expand their risk appetite even more and this at a time when several indicators of excessive risk taking are already flashing yellow if not red with easing unlikely to have much beneficial economic effects corporate and economic fundamentals will lag further already elevated asset prices thereby accentuating threats of future financial instability that could cause economic harm the more the fed stimulates when the economy is in a good place the more it will be seen as succumbing to undue pressures from markets and the white house this could damage its credibility and undermine the effectiveness of its future policy guidance the fed will balance all this at the july 30 31 policy making meeting of its federal open market committee fomc and with the option of no rate cut practically precluded as it would likely trigger considerable market volatility and quite a political reaction the question boils down to whether to cut interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points the most probable outcome and it s a high probability one is a 25 bps cut wrapped in language that keep open the possibility of more reductions later this year thereby lowering the risk of market and political backlash but make no mistake the fed will be paying a premium for this insurance cut and it s a premium that could prove material if the economy were to hit a rough patch due to either domestic or external disruptions mohamed a el erian is the chief economic advisor to allianz the corporate parent of pimco where he served as ceo and co cio 2007 2014 a bloomberg columnist and financial times contributing editor he was chair of president obama s global development council and has authored two new york times best sellers the 2008 when markets collide and 2016 the only game in town read the latest financial and business news from yahoo finance follow yahoo finance on twitter facebook instagram flipboard smartnews linkedin youtube and reddit
after three years of negotiations puerto rico s federal overseers are at last finishing up a plan to complete the restructuring of the island s roughly 124 billion in debt to resolve the biggest government financial collapse in united states history they have had to untangle the island s thorny finances negotiate with creditors and figure out how to do it without endangering the livelihoods of retirees who rely solely on their pensions that may have been the easy part some of the island s creditors including the hedge fund aurelius capital management which held up argentina s debt settlement for years for a better deal will almost certainly challenge the plan on the ground that it violates the territory s 1952 constitution at the center of it all are two intertwined issues the oversight board wants to cut back the amount paid to some of those who hold the territory s debt while also giving an unexpectedly good deal to more than 300 000 workers and retirees some of whom do not even have social security the good deal for the pension holders means a worse one for the holders of puerto rico s debt you can make social and political decisions said james e spiotto a longtime municipal bankruptcy lawyer who is not involved in puerto rico s legal proceedings but it s best to have them wrapped up in a settlement that everybody agrees to
menafn afp at rallies and whistle stop campaign tours president donald trump proclaims a renaissance in us factories rebuilding the nation with american steel american heart and american hands but in reality despite his relentless use of punitive tariffs to help skew the playing field in favor of us companies the very industries he has tried to help have become the weakest links in the otherwise solid economy with just over a year to go before he faces reelection trump takes credit for the most vigorous economy in the industrialized world with the expansion entering its 11th year and historically low unemployment but while services and office jobs dominate the us economy trump continues to promote the factory and mining jobs that were the lifeblood of the economy in the last century american steel mills are roaring back to life he declared last month in florida the same day us steel announced it would idle plants in michigan and indiana until market conditions improve and to west virginians he said the coal industry is back but in fact each of the sectors trump has championed coal mining steel aluminum and auto manufacturing have been buffeted by a combination of market forces and changing technologies factors beyond his control or damaged by the very things he did to protect them economists and analysts say last month a national survey of manufacturing activity hit its lowest level in nearly three years narrowly avoiding slipping into contraction while regional surveys have also seen record declines in march the number of workers in us manufacturing shrank for the first time in nearly two years and it is now growing more slowly than the rest of the american workforce there s clearly a rather large element of hyperbole in what the president has said said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing which supported the tariffs trump has put on steel aluminum and chinese imports but he adds i think it s also fair to say a lot of americans wanted to see a president fight for american industry trump has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions in imports renegotiated trade agreements and dangled the threat of worse over china and europe and mexico all while publicly browbeating companies that close us factories or move production offshore but weak foreign demand a strong us dollar and a decades long evolution away from domestic manufacturing have progressively shrunk america s industrial sector said gregory daco chief us economist at oxford economics trump s world trade war has not helped either automakers greatest threat the polices that have been implemented in terms of protectionism have hurt the very sectors they were meant to protect there s no escaping that daco told afp to boost the coal industry the president has rolled back regulations on the climate and pollution last month he ordered the energy department to pour millions into research to boost the performance of coal fired power plants but coal is in crisis as more electrical utilities switch to cheaper wind solar and natural gas coal consumption has plummeted to its lowest level in 40 years according to the energy department and bankruptcies have abounded closing dozens of mines shrinking capacity and idling hundreds of workers one company this month shuttered operations with no warning to workers and while us production of primary aluminum has risen benefitting from the worldwide 10 percent tariffs trump imposed last year the number of workers at american aluminum smelters has actually fallen one percent since trump took office according to the labor department on wall street share prices for century aluminum and alcoa corp the top us producers have fallen by more than 50 percent in the last year prices have plunged since last year largely due to oversupply from china said tom leary vice president at harbor aluminum in texas adding that domestic market premiums rose with the tariffs meaning us made product is frequently no cheaper than imports a 10 percent tariff it s not enough leary added elsewhere as automakers pour billions into developing new technologies for autonomous and electric vehicles they are abandoning factories that made the sedans and compacts americans no longer want to buy and as a result the industry has been laying off workers at the fastest pace since the great recession according to the employment firm challenger gray christmas charles chesbrough senior economist at cox automotive said trump s twitter bombast has forced automakers to think twice about offshoring production in a twitter outburst friday trump again touted tariffs as a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home but his threat to put 25 percent tariffs on auto imports would massively disrupt us auto manufacturing in ways still hard to quantify i would say that the president still remains the greatest threat to the industry chesbrough told afp

if you re thinking of raising the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour you need maximum compassion and liberals don t have it promises of more money for lots of people can make voters ridiculously happy if they don t understand that more for some always means less for others so the liberals get elected do their thing and ruin lives of the poorest and most disadvantaged of our fellow citizens here s a big issue just underlined in a report by the bipartisan congressional budget office it says increasing the current 7 25 minimum wage by that much could fatten the wallets of 17 million workers that sounds great except that maybe for 1 3 million others it could bring their pay checks to zero they could lose their jobs knock on doors and probe the internet for maybe weeks and months and then possibly retire to watching tv and sighing a lot such calculations are of course just educated guesses that other guesses of higher or less erudition may dispute the heritage foundation for instance says that a wage boost to 15 would affect a third of those earning wages and salaries and could put a devastating 7 million of them on the streets the chief beneficiaries would be suburban teens and some economists say entrepreneurs would be made more timid the point is that businesses would have to come up with the extra money one way or the other an obvious means being to lay people off usually the less skilled sometimes replaceable by technology the fired then don t get the experience leading to better jobs in the future and won t wish liberals a place in heaven businesses may also raise prices thereby reducing purchasing power for people who often can t afford the squeeze the owners could also substitute part time jobs for fulltime jobs or if nothing worked well close down their operations a deprivation not just to them but to other employees and the community another issue is that a federal minimum wage of 15 might seem appropriate for the economy of one state or area while it would be malware for another but never mind right now as you might have noticed we ve got a bunch of democrats running in a primary that they hope will advance their cause of white house residence on this issue they could opt for a lower minimum wage to help reduce the negatives but at least 19 of the candidates like 15 an argument is that the current minimum wage has been squatting in a corner for years while wages in general have been stagnant some would have you know it s all because of the greedy rich exploiting workers with republican aid nope a republican named president donald trump has raised wages with unemployment rates reaching historic lows even as cheers of halleluiah fail to reach democratic ears trump s tool was not governmental impositions making businesses seek a place to hide but deregulation and tax reform the economic system was free at last or headed that way and corporations expanded and created jobs oh no it didn t happen say the democrats who lately have been giving socialism a hug and want to raise taxes on all those corporations thereby undoing what trump accomplished their other plan is to spend like crazy and look one of trump s major weaknesses has been ignoring the debt but these people could rush us to a crisis in a minute to help fix everything gone crazily amiss there would be their minimum wage hikes and soon enough the public would realize they are on the titanic even as an opportunistic captain keeps saying don t worry jay ambrose formerly with scripps howard news service is a tns op ed writer tns jay ambrose formerly with scripps howard news service is a tns op ed writer tns jay ambrose tribune news service

but the agenda this week is likely to be set by us earnings as local investors wait to see how us firms are fairing through the ongoing trade war it s going to be quite interesting because the expectations are quite low said atlas funds management chief investment officer hugh dive he suggested weaker earnings could prompt the federal reserve to be more vigorous in considering rate cuts which would likely push the local sharemarket higher hugh dive said bad news on wall street could be good news for the asx michele mossop we ll be looking closely for the impact of trade wars and how that s flowed through earnings if we do see some negative data that firms up the chance of a us rate cut he said we re in a weird situation where bad news equals good news and good news could be interpreted by the market going down advertisement the market is pricing in a 22 5 per cent chance of the fed cutting rates by 50 basis points at its meeting in july with a zero per cent chance it remains on hold there is a 37 2 per cent chance the fed will have cut by 75 basis points by the end of the year fifteen of the 18 largest banks on wall street will report their second quarter earnings this week with jpmorgan chase bank of america citigroup wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley all releasing results i think the results will be fine except maybe the banks said swell asset management chief investment officer lachlan hughes the heavy flow of money into the equity market this year on the back of tumbling bond yields and falling rates means valuations have put a high bar on earnings expectations advertisement there is a risk there because across the board investors have been pushed up the risk curve said mr hughes lachlan hughes says the bank results could be weaker james brickwood we ll get the results but there is potential for the market to come back the next few weeks will be crucial for many us companies who will need to justify their elevated prices as wall street continues to test all time highs higher valuations are mathematically possible as the discount rate comes down but the concern is that earnings start to roll over and those valuations are just no longer justified said jpmorgan asset management global market strategist kerry craig locally the us will set the tone for australian markets until our own earnings season really kicks into gear in the middle of august advertisement local investors will also be waiting for a solid indication of how the reserve bank will use its remaining policy ammunition with key june labour force data set to be released on thursday nab flagged on friday that a rise in the unemployment rate would increase the likelihood of an august rate cut the third in as many months the rba will also release the minutes from its july meeting on tuesday when it cut the cash rate to a record low of 1 per cent there will be considerable interest in any exposition of the final part of the post meeting statement that the board will continue to monitor developments in the labour market and adjust monetary policy if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time anz economists noted on friday futures markets are implying just a 14 per cent chance the rba cuts rates at its next meeting but a 70 per cent chance it will ease its monetary policy at its november meeting a cut to 0 75 per cent is fully priced in by march next year
