published wednesday 19 june 2019 print disqus by richard rick mills when americans elect or re elect a president in the fall of 2020 there is a very good chance the closest thing to their hearts their wallets will be top of mind that s because many are predicting the longest running economic expansion in us history is about to slam on the brakes it s been over a decade since the great recession of 2007 09 plunged the world into monetary despair that downturn was particularly bad because it combined an economic slowdown with problems in the financial system rudely exposed by the sub prime mortgage crisis in this article we are asking what is the best indicator for predicting the next recession what does the current data say about a recession economic headwinds we ve become so used to the stock market being in the green we barely notice when the dow nasdaq or s p 500 have a bad day stocks have become like real estate keep buying them because over time they will always go up but as we pointed out in a gold article last week key economic indicators are blinking caution for investors us unemployment is at record lows but the job numbers are indicating a shift the country created 75 000 jobs in may well off the expected 185 000 president trump likes to take credit for near full employment but in fact the jobless rate has been falling for several years shown in the fred chart below it reached 10 during the great recession second only to nearly 11 in 1980 and has fallen steadily under the watch of president obama who was first elected in 2008 trump has but china still hasn t confirmed whether its president for life xi jinping will meet with president trump at the upcoming g 20 to try and make progress on the trade war which is far more serious than a year ago when the first tariffs on aluminum and steel were enacted tariffs now encompass over half of the roughly 500 billion in goods that china exports to the us and almost all american goods imported by china the us has banned large tech companies like intel from doing any more business with huawei one of the world s largest smartphone makers and builder of 5g networks the federal government is pursuing almost two dozen criminal charges against huawei and its chief financial officer over its dealings with us sanctioned iran in retaliation china fined ford 23 6 million for anti trust violations and is investigating fedex for wrongful deliveries automotive news said the country is also threatening to blacklist foreign firms that damage the interests of chinese companies and has warned its citizens against traveling to the us uncertainty over the trade war is having an effect on business leaders who are deferring strategic decisions and in some cases rejigging their supply chains google has already shifted production of its motherboards to taiwan to avoid a 25 tariff and is looking at adding nest thermostats and server hardware taiwan based foxconn which assembles iphone and ipads for apple said it s prepared to move production out of china if necessary on friday morgan stanley reported a rapid deterioration in us business confidence the investment bank s gauge of business conditions fell 32 points last month the biggest drop since the financial crisis orders for durable goods are down and the purchasing managers index pmi of the countries that count are sucking wind wolf street called the us pmi figure of 50 2 the cleanest of the dirty shirts germany japan and china were all lower china s national bureau of statistics published signs of a sluggish economy on friday notably lower industrial output and investment the pmis for us services and manufacturing in may were the worst since recessionary 2009 adding to the sentiment that us economic growth is slowing as for the us federal reserve its board of governors is hinting that a rate cut is being considered as a way to bolster the flagging economy a complete 180 from six months ago when the us central bank was looking at raising interest rates why because the fed is concerned about low global growth especially the chinese economy and disturbing signals that we are heading into a recession 50 years of recessions what is this thing we are calling a recession in a nutshell a recession is what results when an economy stops growing the national bureau of economic research nber is the group entrusted to call the beginning and end dates of a recession nber defines it as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months normally visible in real gdp real income employment industrial production and wholesale retail sales economists agree that a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in gdp which is the total value of all goods and services a country produces results from a recent poll showed nearly half of cfos surveyed expect to see negative growth by the second quarter of 2020 two thirds of economists predict a recession by the end of 2020 citing trade policy as the greatest risk while another 10 believe the contraction will start this year jeffrey gundlach the so called bond king is equally bearish on the economy he puts the odds of a us recession within the next six months at 40 50 and 65 over the next year marketwatch reports marko kolanovic jp morgan s chief quant strategist saying that president donald trump s trade battles have cost u s companies trillions and could trigger a downturn that would end up being known as the trump recession if the above mentioned analysts and surveys are right and a recession is around the corner it would be extremely helpful to know what are the signs also one shouldn t get lulled into thinking that because we ve enjoyed a decade of strong growth that the next slowdown will be gradual or soft history proves otherwise expansions don t die they re killed there s an old saying in economics that expansions don t die of old age meaning there is always an event or sometimes more than one that causes a long period of economic growth to end investopedia does a nice job of naming the causes all the us recessions going back to the roosevelt recession of 1937 38 unfortunately it skips the great recession widely known to be caused by a housing crisis in the us due to sub prime mortgages which resulted in a credit squeeze bank failures and subsequent government bailouts we learn the main triggers for the last three recessions before 2007 09 were in reverse chronological order the pop of the dot com bubble and 9 11 attacks 9 11 recession iraq s invasion of kuwait causing the oil price to spike gulf war recession 1990 91 and the regime change in iran which also caused an energy crisis iran energy crisis recession 1981 82 forcing the us to invoke drastic fiscal tightening culminating in an interest rate spike to 21 5 in fact investopedia reveals the common factor throughout nearly all us recessions is oil market turbulence a sudden increase in the price of crude oil has preceded nine out of 10 post wwii recessions energy prices let s get back to basics most recessions nine of the last 10 are caused by energy crises not surprising considering our dependence on fossil fuels while the amount of renewable energy capacity is increasing every year global consumption of energy is still dominated by fossil fuels and hydro electric power the latter require the construction and upgrading of dams itself a fossil fuel intensive endeavor oil price shocks send ripples through the canadian and american economies since both are significant oil producers for example at the end of 1998 crude oil was priced at just 11 a barrel by late 2000 it had tripled to 34 bbl high oil prices combined with the dot com crash and enron resulted in the 2000 2001 recession an oil price shock puts pressure on other prices to increase like transportation costs which hikes inflation businesses put expansions and hiring on hold or lay people off gradually gdp growth slows unemployment rises as does the cost of living costs are rising but the dollar is worth less people have less to invest or invest more conservatively moving their money out of stocks and into safe havens like bonds foreign currencies and precious metals sustained selling crushes the stock market a recession ensues oil prices shaded areas are recessions yield curve in a typical healthy market the yield curve shows lower returns on short term investments and higher yields on long term investments more importantly yield curve inversion has come before every recession since world war ii the yield curve between long term and short term treasury note yields has been inverted since may 23 in other words short term yields like the three month one year and three year treasury notes turned higher than long term yields that s unusual because it means bond investors prefer to park their money in bonds that will pay them back their money plus interest in one months to three years versus investing in a bond with a term of 10 to 30 years in which case they would demand a higher yield for tying up their money so long a yield curve inversion shows low confidence in the long term performance of the us economy among bond investors however on monday yields jumped the 10 year treasury is at 2 101 and the three year yield at 1 815 as i write the market is focused on the federal reserve s meeting on wednesday when it will announce its interest rate policy investors are anticipating the fed to hold its overnight lending rate the interest rate at which banks loan money to one another unchanged at this meeting and possibly signal a cut to the federal funds rate later in the summer remember up until monday the yield curve was inverted showing a negative spread between long term and short term t bill yields meaning investors had more confidence in short term than long term bonds yield curve inversion oil prices so far we know that yield curve inversions are a very strong indicator of a coming recession all of the post wwii recessions except two were preceded by an inversion we also know that nine out of the last 10 recessions saw oil prices spike immediately or very close before the recession at ahead of the herd we decided to compare two charts the historical price of oil and historical yield curve inversions to see if there is any correlation in fact the two charts match very closely the first chart below shows all the yield curve inversions from the last 50 years along with the recessions that followed the gray bars the second chart is the historical price of west texas intermediate wti the north american crude oil benchmark the u s yield curve steepness chart below courtesy of jp morgan asset management is very interesting it shows when the yield curve inverts a recession is very likely to follow on average 14 months after the point when the curve inverts ie the curve goes under the horizontal line demarcating 0 this has been the case for the last 50 years as an article in advisor perspective reports this yield curve recession indicator is so reliable it cannot be argued author erik conley writes i don t know of any economists who dispute this assertion history is history and not theory taking a look at the chart below there was a recession every time after the yield curve inverted for the last 56 years except for two times when there was an inversion without a recession how s that for odds now take a look at the oil price chart reproduced here for easy comparison in all of the recessions there was a preceding oil price spike for example before the oil crisis recession of 1973 75 the inversion occurred in 1973 and continued to fall to 2 as the fed tightened short term rates to try and tame inflation caused by spending on the vietnam war during this period oil prices tripled beginning with the opec oil embargo in 1973 or the 1990 91 gulf war recession the yield curve inverted in 1989 about a year before the recession caused by iraq invading kuwait whose actions threatened more oil price shocks began oil was gradually rising from 1985 to 1990 when it makes a rapier like slash up to nearly 80 a barrel from around 25 bbl the financial crisis of 2007 09 is even more demonstrative of the connection here we had the inversion occurring in 2006 which few people recognized as a daunting signal to sell their stocks the recession began in the fall of 2007 and by 2010 the spread between short and long term t bill yields had grown to about 2 5 meanwhile wti made an incredible run in a very short time from under 20 bbl in 1998 to an all time high of 163 80 in 2008 finally consider that the two times the yield curve didn t go into recession it was when the oil price was dropping comparing the two charts for the last time look at the red dots in 1966 and 1998 these inversion point anomalies ie happening without a recession coming an average 14 months later occur when the price of oil is falling no recession to us being the keep it simple kind of folks we are this proves 1 that yield curve inversions are excellent recession indicators basically acting as energy price spike warnings and 2 that energy prices can both start recessions and prevent them oil prices interest rates housing market a lot of forecasters consider the housing market to be a reliable indicator of a coming recession economist edward e leamer declared in 2007 that housing is the business cycle recessions are considered part of the business cycle along with expansions and contractions a statement he was proven right on when the housing crisis that presaged the great recession began that same year according to the st louis fed housing downturns have preceded every post war recession warning signals include rising mortgage rates a dip in home sales and lower house prices we would expect housing starts to be a good predictor of a recession since they signal the confidence of home builders in financing projects and being willing to sell them to eager home buyers if developers and builders think a recession is coming they are unlikely to take on new work the st louis fed research found a strong recession indicator in lower housing starts for the last four months before each downturn began it refers to this scenario as a housing starts inversion if a housing starts inversion occurs there is around a 50 likelihood that a recession will start in the next three months not bad odds u s homebuilding starts fell in may dropping 0 9 to 1 269 million units but data for the prior two months was revised higher high household debt we re going to go a little out on a limb here in presenting our next recession predictor unsustainable household debt in 2015 the federal reserve started raising interest rates thinking the economy was making a full recovery following the great recession but as we ve pointed out it was a false recovery based on a very shaky foundation still in 2018 it was hard to argue with 4 1 growth in gdp during the second quarter the fed continued their raises predicting four more in 2019 now they ve changed their tune with gdp growth falling and all the other aforementioned economic storm clouds blowing in rate increases are off the table and we are now looking at another rate cut maybe even reprising the infamous quantitative easing qe it would be the first rise since 2015 and the stock market businesses and consumers would all love it if the economy is faltering and with the fed having raised interest rates from close to 0 in 2015 to the current 2 5 we should expect consumer spending to tank in fact this is not what we are seeing it s true people are buying less houses but they are lining up to spend on just about everything else how do we explain this rash of spending people are making purchases on credit consumer spending makes up 68 of the us economy if most businesses are doing well and they appear to be from the statistics employees should theoretically have more to spend on goods and services people are keeping their jobs and their wages are going up this in fact is what we find the balance reports that consumer spending increased by 1 2 in the first quarter of this year and notes that strong consumer spending is the main reason the gdp growth rate has been within the 2 3 healthy range since the great recession consumer spending has gone up steadily since the first quarter of 2018 when it was 12 7 trillion to 13 trillion in q1 2019 us car sales have leapt from 16 4 million in april to 17 3 million in may consumer spending that got me curious as to where people are finding the money to spend 13 trillion in the first quarter the answer appears to be uncle visa a bloomberg article reports that us credit card debt skyrocketed to 870 billion in 2018 a new record revolving credit americans have more money in their bank accounts but what they make they re spending maxing out their credit cards and dumping balances on lines of credit the us savings rate skidded from 7 5 last december to 6 2 in april it s a far cry from the parsimonious americans of 1975 who put away a record 17 3 of their income freedom 55 forget about it most workers in the us will be toiling away at their work stations into their golden years marketwatch reported on friday that the gap between what people should have socked away for retirement and what they actually have was 28 trillion in 2015 it only gets worse by 2050 that number is expected to swell to 137 trillion according to the world economic forum or a 3 trillion increase in the gap every year canadians like to think of themselves as less materialistic than americans but in fact what we see is canucks heading to the malls and giving their credit card numbers to e commerce platforms with reckless abandon wolfstreet com reports that despite rock bottom interest rates and the highest ever disposable income the percentage that canadian households spend paying principal and interest on mortgages and other debts reached 14 9 in the first quarter matching the record reached in 2017 in canada debt to disposable income was a whopping 175 in 2018 one of the highest rates in the world and rising versus 103 in the us and falling why are us debt levels coming down wolfstreet notes that a lot of home owners defaulted on their mortgages and credit cards after the financial crisis which skewed the numbers another issue is the fear factor of getting too far into debt a lot of americans are gun shy of holding uncomfortably high mortgages knowing that is what caused the great recession they have watched interest rates climb and they don t want to be saddled with higher payments wolfstreet adds that continued low interest rates have created two of the world s biggest housing bubbles in vancouver and toronto many torontonians and vancouverites have such large mortgages that even a small rate increase would make monthly payments a hardship they are truly debt slaves to the banks like household debt government debt is getting more and more unsustainable the problem for the central bank as it considers how it will handle interest rates at its next federal open market committee meeting is how to stimulate the economy and trigger real economic growth rather than just creating asset bubbles in corporate debt and financial markets in february the us national debt hit a record 22 trillion according to npr that means over the next 10 years annual federal deficits are expected to average 1 2 trillion which is 4 4 of gdp much higher than the 2 9 average over the past 50 years snatching defeat from the jaws of victory donald trump rolled into the white house on a promise to drain the swamp in washington of corruption and to put the pedal to the metal on america s economy by bringing back jobs lost to out sourcing and tearing up horrible trade deals not only with the us s strongest competitor china but its so called friends as well like canada and the eu it came apparent a few weeks into his term that trump would be a do er not a thinker in december 2017 his administration passed new legislation implementing 1 5 trillion of corporate and individual tax cuts by the following summer the effects of those cuts started to be felt in the economy although they mostly benefited corporations due to billions of profits that were repatriated from overseas and plowed into stock buybacks nonetheless the 4 2 quarterly growth in gdp was real and something trump could crow about since becoming president in 2017 trump has consistently bragged about the stock market bull that despite pulling back last fall continues to run he s even said that if he loses the 2020 election the stock market will crash same with impeachment the trump economy is setting records and has a long way up to go however if anyone but me takes over in 2020 i know the competition very well there will be a market crash the likes of which has not been seen before keep america great trump tweeted saturday the truth is that trump has very little to do with the strength in the us economy in fact one could argue the economy has done well despite his economic leadership as the chart below shows gross domestic product was growing when obama was elected for a second term in 2016 however even obama s charm couldn t stop the economy from sliding to just 1 9 growth in 2016 when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 it was at 1 8 then jumped to 3 by july between july 2017 and january 2018 it was all downhill the spike to 4 2 the following july was short lived six months later growth had slumped to 2 2 and it now sits at 3 1 us gdp all trump had to do was sit back and do nothing maybe get into a regular golf routine with his buddies at mar a logo and the economy would have hummed along just fine instead we have the tweeter in chief picking fights with all his trading partners passing a massive tax cut that benefited the wealthy and corporations thus exacerbating the divide between rich and poor putting america s exorbitant privilege in jeopardy by snubbing its allies and forcing them into the arms of the enemy as mexico has indicated by holding high level talks with china the dollar is under threat as the reserve currency italy has joined china s belt and road initiative trump refused to shake hands with angela merkel and is now threatening to slap tariffs on auto imports from the eu but the scariest part in all of this is what could happen in iran after two oil tankers were recently attacked in the strait of hormuz trump and his secretary of state mike pompeo were quick to blame iran as the culprit whether or not that s true america going to war with iran right now would be very bad news for the economy let s consider the likely fallout of an attack on ships in the extremely narrow and shallow strait of hormuz over a third of the world s oil flows through the strait if there s war iran will close this vital choke point now the sudden tightening of oil supplies similar to what happened in the 1970s would immediately push up the price of crude interest rates would rise further damaging business confidence and putting the squeeze on corporate and consumer borrowing the dollar would plummet making imported goods more expensive americans standard of living would fall as costs stay the same or become inflated along with energy prices but the dollar is worth less the us dollar s already questionable exorbitant privilege of being the world s reserve currency would come into sharper focus trade in gold and other safe havens besides us treasuries would increase the guardian reminds us of the fragile state the world economy is in having not fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 and getting slammed by tariffs thereby slowing down growth imagine what 80 100 or 140 barrel oil could do the global economy is struggling to regain momentum after the tit for tat trade tariff battles initiated by the trump administration a slowdown in trade over the past 18 months and a collapse in investment spending will push down gdp growth to 2 6 this year after several years above 3 the world bank said in its most recent forecast fears of a slowdown in the demand for oil are one of the main factors keeping a lid on prices at the moment if a deal was struck between the us and china when the two countries presidents meet in june one that prevents an escalation of the trade war economic prospects would receive a boost higher global demand and further tanker bombings in the gulf would probably push oil prices back up towards 80 as we have proven oil price spikes are nearly 100 correlated to recessions right now we also have the other recession indicators we ve outlined yield curve inversion real 10 year yields high levels of indebtedness low housing sales etc it wouldn t take much like a war with iran to tip the boat over in fact the only thing that appears to be keeping the current economy from falling into recession is low oil prices and that is precisely what trump s threats on iran are putting at risk ever the bully trump is literally snatching defeat from the jaws of victory concerning the us economy real yield correlation the federal reserve bank of st louis looked at all the post war recessions that the yield curve had predicted then they compared the 10 year treasury yield at the precise beginning of inversion to the length of the subsequent recession taking into account two variables the duration of the recession and the unemployment rate the results were astonishing lower real rates 10 year yields minus inflation at the onset of a recession correlated with worse downturns what s the connection according to the researchers there is a clear correlation between real interest rates and the severity of a recession the lower the real interest rate the longer a recession that follows a yield curve inversion the real 10 year rate also tracks unemployment suggesting there may be causation between real rates and economic output low levels of real interest rates capture early warnings of future slowdown in economic growth the report said in other words the lower the real 10 year bond yield the more likely it is that the economy will go into recession lower real rates at the point of yield curve inversion also correspond to longer recessions extrapolating that idea to the current data points to an ominous result from the graph below the current real 10 year yield nominal rate minus 1 8 inflation is 0 35 which would plot the vertical line far to the left of where it was in september 1978 during the worst post war recession that means the next recession if the correlation holds true and the real 10 year rate doesn t change much is likely to last longer than 32 months and be characterized by more than 4 5 unemployment in an article on project syndicate nouriel roubini says a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 compared to 5 25 in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing qe central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments the growing risk of a 2020 recession and crisis conclusion what pushes the us into recession war with iran or anything else that causes an oil price spike this article started with the question which is the best indicator for predicting a recession we presented five it should be clear by now that while the other four indicators have some bearing on whether we enter a recessionary downturn it is energy prices that are the underpinning of our entire global economic system mess around too much with oil prices and the fallout will be immediate and likely severe that goes for both dramatic oil price jumps and death defying falls the health of the world economy is predicated on oil prices somewhere north of 50 a barrel and south of 100 bbl the yield curve is the most reliable recession indicator it has shown remarkable ability to predict energy caused recessions we ve proved this graphically and it makes sense the global economy still runs on fossil fuels only 9 3 of global electricity generation excluding hydro in 2018 was from renewables we normally think of the price of energy that keeps an economy in check when oil and natural gas prices are too high businesses that depend on those fuels get hit passing their higher costs onto consumers and in 2014 when the oil price crashed consumer and businesses were happy but it was governments that suffered in terms of depreciated currencies and a big hit to resource revenues but what if we thought about it a different way right now energy prices are low so the economy should be humming along but it s not we ve outlined all the negative indicators showing signs of a sick patient of an economy lower energy costs are like the iv hooked up to that patient they are keeping it alive raise oil prices now and the economy will be in for a shock interest rates will go up employment will crash housing starts will crash and the level of consumer debt will take on a whole new meaning consumer spending is 70 of the us economy the economic patient may even stop breathing the equivalent of gdp growth stopping and go into a recessionary coma predicting a recession is hard if anyone is able to do it they would surely deserve a pulitzer prize in economics as retail investors we obviously don t know if it s to be war with iran or not but we know what happens if it

overview ecb president draghi underscoring the likely need for more stimulus broke the subdued tone as market participants took a wait and see stance ahead of tomorrow s fomc decision draghi s comments sent the euro through 1 12 for the first time in two weeks and drove european bonds yields to new lows asian equity markets were mostly higher with the exception of japan as order returned to hong kong it was the hang seng that led the region with a little more than a 0 9 gain european equities picked up after draghi s comments and the dow jones stoxx 600 was about 0 8 higher in late morning turnover led by the interest rate sensitive utilities sector and health care financials were struggling under the prospect of still lower rates despite concerns about the doom loop of european banks exposure to their sovereign bonds the rally in bonds has done little for bank shares consider that with today s 10 13 bp decline in italy s benchmark 10 year yield the bank shares are lower for the fourth session in the past five over the past month as italy s bond yield has fallen 50 bp the bank share index is off roughly 11 european benchmark yields outside of italy are off around five to seven basis points with most hitting new record lows us shares are trading higher and the 10 year yield has slipped a couple basis points to nearly 2 05 the dollar is firmer against most of the major currencies save the japanese yen the lower rates in the high income countries are reigniting the yield hunt into emerging market and helping to lift the liquid accessible and volatile currencies like the south african rand and turkish lira east and central european currencies are being dragged lower by the euro the chinese yuan is practically unchanged cny6 9265 asia pacific the minutes from the reserve bank of australia s meeting earlier this month underscored the dovish bias additional stimulus was deemed more likely than not the central bank appeared to call on the government fiscal policy to bolster efforts to support the labor market it noted that mortgage arrears were back near 2010 highs but not spurring systemic stress separately australian reported that its index of house prices fell 3 in q1 which was a bit more than expected and takes prices down 7 4 year over year it was the fourth consecutive quarter that the year over year rate contracted and it is doing so at an accelerated pace in q1 18 house prices had gained 6 8 year over year in china new house prices rose 0 71 in may for an 11 3 increase from a year ago new houses prices have risen by an average of 0 62 in the first five months of 2019 in the same period a year ago house prices averaged a monthly gain of 0 48 china manages both supply and demand and it appears that the rise in house prices may be more a function of supply constraints rather than robust demand the dollar has held above jpy108 since last monday there is only a 530 mln option struck there that is set to expire today and larger options there will expire in the coming days including 2 7 bln tomorrow and 1 3 bln on thursday the first target of a break is jpy107 75 but our reading of the charts suggests an objective near jpy107 the dovish rba minutes have sent the australian dollar to new lows 0 6830 since the january 3 flash crash that saw it drop to around 0 6740 which is next important target previous support near 0 6865 may become resistance europe draghi and a collapse in german investor confidence have stirred the foreign exchange and debt markets the ecb president was more dovish than he seemed to be at the ecb meeting a fortnight ago he warned that in the absence of improvement that inflation was headed toward its target additional stimulus was necessary draghi suggested that if needed rates can be cut with measures to mitigate some of the undesired consequences and that the limits around asset purchases could also be revisited the news follows the bundesbank s warning yesterday that europe s biggest economy may have contracted in q2 although draghi s term does not end until october there seems to be some hesitancy to lock in the next ecb president too much separately germany s zew survey disappointed the assessment of the current situation edged lower to 7 8 from 8 2 between the start of last year through june this year the current assessment has improved in only four months this year there has been one increase and that was in may more disturbing was the collapse in the expectations component it plunged from 2 1 to 21 1 it is the worst since last november and it is lower than a year ago 16 1 the optimists hope that the weak data will prompt germany to reconsider its fiscal stance and may win its support for more measures by the ecb that said recently bbk president weidmann has cautioned against deferring rate normalization the selection of the next tory leader in the uk moves into overdrive starting today in the second round candidates need to secure at least 33 mp votes or they do not make it to the third round which will be held tomorrow and the fourth round on thursday when two candidates remain the rank and file will decide meanwhile prime minister may s push for gbp27 bln for education over the next three years is controversial and chancellor of the exchequer hammond has threatened to resign the euro has been sold below 1 12 and has found some bids near 1 1180 an option for 562 mln euros at 1 1150 expires today and a 1 6 bln euro option at 1 12 will also be cut looking ahead on thursday there are another 1 6 bln euros in a 1 1150 strike that will expire in late april through may the euro as seemed to carve a base around 1 11 sterling extended its decline to near 1 25 it is its lowest level since the january 3 flash crash that may have seen 1 2440 a move now back above 1 2550 would help stabilize the tone the euro approached gbp0 8975 the high since mid january but has backed off support is seen in the gbp0 8900 gbp0 8920 area america we caution against reading too much into the latest us treasury data that shows china reduced its holding by 7 5 bln in april before trump declared the end to the tariff truce china sold about 10 1 bln in us bonds and notes and bought around 2 6 bln in bills april was the second consecutive month of net sales but it was preceded by a three month accumulation as a whole foreign central banks sold about 27 5 bln of us treasury bonds and notes not including bills in april china accounted for a little more than a third these are hardly even rounding errors given china s current holdings of a nearly 1 113 trillion more than any other country china s surged from about 845 bln in mid 2010 1 314 trillion in july 2011 it has been above there marginally and has not been below roughly 1 05 trillion since and now is near the middle of the range moreover a decline in treasury holdings is not necessarily an aggressive act consider that japan s treasury holdings the second largest in the world peaked in november 2014 near 1 241 trillion and now stand near 1 064 trillion three other holdings caught our eye belgium which hosts euroclear has sometimes been thought to hide chinese reserves so it treasury holdings rise and fall sharply in 2013 2015 they bottomed in 2017 a little below 100 bln but by january 2019 they had nearly doubled they have pulled back in recent months and are now a little below 180 bln saudi arabia s treasury holdings have risen sharply in recent years according to us data the saudis owned practically no treasuries as recently as 2003 2004 they rose to around 80 bln by mid 2009 where they hovered until 2014 when they began rising perhaps the weakness in oil prices in 2016 was behind the roughly 35 bln drop in treasury holdings but the accumulation quickly resumed and in april a new record of 176 6 bln was registered the uk s treasury holdings swung violently in the 2004 2011 period but since then they have been steadily climbing at the end of 2011 they stood near 107 bln and peaked in march a little more than 317 bln before pulling back in april to about 301 bln part of the recent increase may reflect the building up of reserves to prepare for brexit but something more is going on in the last six months uk reserves have risen by about 6 6 bln while treasury holdings have increased by around 37 bln maybe the negative yields associated with core european bonds spurred some reallocation poor infrastructure led to a blackout in brazilian 2009 and one in venezuela earlier this year the outage over the weekend that impacts tens of millions of people in argentina uruguay and paraguay may have been simply another episode an investigation is underway which may take the better part of the next two weeks while some argentine officials are playing down the likelihood that it was a cyber attack as the trigger for the cascading effect appears to have been a transmission point between two power stations still others refuse to rule it out they wonder if it is coincidental that the ny times had just revealed that the us had penetrated a russian utility trump accused denied the report and simultaneously accused it of virtual treason russia press reported yesterday that it had identified attempts by the us to use cyber attacks on its infrastructure the conspiracy theorists cannot link russia to argentina s blackout but it may have just been opportunistic some suggest trump appears to like argentina s president macri who faces voters in october after promising to address the electrical grid a weaker macri boosts the chances that kirchner returns as vice president under fernandez her former chief of cabinet ministries who is leading in macri in some polls as a senator kirchner enjoys immunity and it is disputed

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

this is not investment advice the author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned wccftech com has a disclosure and ethics policy facebook visa mastercard uber lyft among other finance and tech companies partner for libra coin in libra association to promote global currency libra coin idea libra coin is being created to try to expand payments globally and lower transaction costs while maintaining security the underlying feature of the coin is that it s backed by international deposits from high quality central banks to create diversification and inflation control the libra association released its white paper on how the cryptocurrency would function highlighting better security and performance while maintaining easy to access networks the underlying technology the underlying technology at the heart of libra coin is the libra core this is an open source platform written in rust to perform the read and write requests in the blockchain when it comes to performance the network will have validators that will need to be certified to help run the network the performance will begin at 1000 payment transactions per second with a 10 second finality time which would help smooth over demand each transaction including overhead is 5kb with 1000 transactions being done per second libra estimates a requirement of 40mbps and a commodity cpu would be able to handle the workload the merkle tree method they are using to run the blockchain claims to be far more efficient than competing blockchains as they can be pruned to only carry essential data in the blockchain as long as information is stored in replicas on different servers from the main processing for queries this keeps the ledger state of the blockchain small this in combination with the move programming language attempt to keep performance high while using fewer resources below is a brief description of a transaction provided from the white paper validators maintain the database and process transactions submitted by clients for inclusion in the database 1 the validators use a distributed consensus protocol to agree on an ever growing list of transactions that have been committed to the database as well as the results of executing those transactions this consensus protocol must be reliable even in the presence of malicious or erroneous behavior by a minority of validators validators take turns driving the process of accepting transactions when a validator acts as a leader it proposes transactions both those directly submitted to it by clients and those indirectly submitted through other validators to the other validators 2 all validators execute the transactions 3 and form an authenticated data structure that contains the new ledger history the validators vote on the authenticator for this data structure as part of the consensus protocol 4 as part of committing a transaction t i at version i the consensus protocol outputs a signature on the full state of the database at version i including its entire history to authenticate responses to queries from clients 5 figure 1 shows the two types of entities that interact using the libra protocol 1 validators which maintain the database and 2 clients which perform queries on the database and submit transactions to modify it what separates libra coin from outside investors and regulators what makes libra coin different from other cryptocurrencies are the central deposits backing the currency these deposits are assets from different countries who have experienced inflation stability the stable currencies assets backing the coin and the diversification globally are what the founding consortium hopes will keep the value of libra relatively stable at least as far as cryptos are concerned the consistency of the coin makes it more viable for payments as it would be less susceptible to the speculation which has created extreme volatility with other cryptocurrencies the second point that separates libra coin from others is the association backing the coin with founding members including visa nyse v mastercard nyse ma paypal nasdaq pypl ebay nasdaq ebay facebook s calibra nasdaq fb lyft nasdaq lyft spotify nyse spot and uber nyse uber having payment processors support the currency is vital to getting global adoption and having tech companies such as ebay uber and lyft using the currency would increase in use the digital marketplace there have been previous attempts at an asset back crypto coins termed stablecoins with tether coming to mind the firm promised a u s dollar backed each coin on a one to one basis however they lacked transparency were hacked and now have been accused of hiding losses while the coin is still trading on the market libra coin appears to have a much larger backing with many tech companies willing to join the association global outlook having different global currencies in reserve would essentially peg the currency to multiple different currencies this would provide less flexibility for the coin to adjust to global demand around it with a decentralized approach the movement of the currency would be based almost entirely on outside forces this would eliminate the ability to provide their guidance on value for an interesting look at foreign currencies pegged to others see the impossible trinity there is also the issue of developing countries without their currencies pegged to others that may experience inflation and merchants not updating their exchange rates fast enough giving the consumer less buying power libra coin hasn t established a size yet or what criteria there is for using a currency in their central holdings if the coin does gain value over time and becomes widely accepted it s possible it may one day have an impact on other currencies as well that it derives its value from although this would likely be a long way off and at present it s unclear what the underlying basket of instruments currencies are which will back libra and whether the value will be derived range pegged somehow or floated although pegging a currency usually only is possible for central banks as it takes huge currency reserves to maintain a set ratio at the currency level take for instance black wednesday in 1992 where the british pound sterling fell outside the range set by the erm and was forced to withdraw george soros had been shorting the currency and flooded the market leading to the ejection from erm while solidifying himself as an fx trader and as the man who broke the bank of england it s assumed the high quality assets will include the united states dollar and euro given the nature of the currencies and amount of countries already pegged to them potentially with some of their government bonds it would also be possible to add the japanese yen swiss franc or sterling to the list for increased diversity it would be hard to imagine the inclusion of the chinese yuan renminbi given the current state of u s china relations and the backing of the coin being from u s based companies mark carney the governor of the bank of england spoke to the press saying if the currency is successful in signing up many users it would be inevitable to have regulations around the coin france s finance minister bruno le maire also echoed similar sentiments when asked about the currency as of writing the u s senate has also called representatives from facebook to testify about the project asking to put the project on hold until it can be reviewed from early information on the currency it seems that libra association is doing what they can to make the currency used for payments instead of investors speculating on the coin in unregulated markets the implementation timeframe was not given but only then will we find out if adoption and stability can be achieved this story is just developing in the comign weeks will be updated as information comes out
washington president trump might get what he wants from the federal reserve which kept interest rates steady on wednesday but indicated that it could soon cut them as economic risks mounted and inflation remained stuck below target a growing number of officials on the fed s policymaking committee expect to lower rates before the end of the year amid continuing trade tensions and slowing global economic growth the fed chair jerome h powell said at a news conference after the fed s two day meeting that officials were watching economic developments to gauge whether and when action was warranted the committee felt that the right thing to do was to wait and see more and we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term mr powell said he added that emerging risks have caused a number of us to write down rate cuts and a number of those who haven t to say that the case has strengthened mr trump has been jawboning the fed to cut rates and stop shrinking the large portfolio of government bonds the central bank amassed in the wake of the financial crisis as it tried to shore up the american economy while the fed operates independently of the white house and strives to ignore political chatter while making rate decisions rising economic threats some of them caused by the trade fights mr trump is waging have forced it to open the door to a cut
the day that investors have been eagerly awaiting in anticipation for at least the past month is finally here the latest federal reserve interest rate decision will be announced this evening where there is an air of euphoria and excitement in financial markets that the federal reserve will begin preparing investors for lower interest rates in the united states over the second half of the year and potentially into 2020 but what if federal reserve chair jerome powell spoils the party for investors it has already been baked into market expectations that the fed will provide guidance of an upcoming future change in us interest rate policy and it s moments like these where investors can suddenly need to buckle up tightly and prepare for a potentially wild ride let s put this into a different perspective if we go back to roughly 2014 this was when the federal reserve first started to provide guidance of a potential change for higher interest rates in the united states the first move higher however in fact didn t occur until towards the end of 2015 so in reality the federal reserve went up the lift very slowly but today markets are ambitiously expecting the same central bank to jump down the escalator after close to 10 increases in us interest rates over the past couple of years at a gradual pace i find it hard to believe that it will be that easy for the federal reserve to do two things wave the flag and surrender then put the car into reverse gear and accelerate downhill today s fed decision can set the tone for market sentiment into next decade make no mistake today s federal reserve decision and the tone that it sets in its statement runs the risk of dictating how financial markets will perform into the next decade if the federal reserve does obey market expectations and issues the requested guidance that us interest rates will be lowered this will flatten forecasts for the usd a dollar that is anticipated to slide downhill on lower us interest rate expectations means a stronger euro yen and pretty much everything else where a weaker usd will be warmly applauded and even possibly welcomed with a standing ovation is in emerging markets the prospects of foreign flows returning into emerging markets would mean at the very least a stronger malaysian ringgit indonesian rupiah philippine peso and chinese yuan stretching further than the asian region the feel good factor of a weaker usd would also mean good news for the likes of the south african rand russian ruble and even further afield the mexican peso avengers assemble ahead of extended meeting between trump xi at g20 us china trade disputes have been a very long winded movie for financial markets think of it as a marvel movie in which trade tensions are very much the villain of the story for market sentiment this is why investors are excited at the news that us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will have an extended meeting at the g20 summit in japan later in june viewers want a happy ending to a very long story and are hoping that captain america and iron man will come to the rescue and save investors from the persistent villain the trade tensions the feel good factor stemming from anticipation that there will hopefully be a resolution has fuelled a rally across emerging market currencies on wednesday morning the korean won philippine peso indonesian rupiah chinese yuan and malaysian ringgit are all stronger against the greenback
things didn t work out as expected for federico sturzenegger when he became argentina s central bank chief one of the country s most renowned economists sturzenegger took over the position in late 2015 with big ideas and bigger challenges bring inflation back down to a single digit after years of price controls non stop money printing and fake statistics the mission proved harder than expected and by the time the former harvard professor left the bank a year ago the argentine peso was in free fall despite a record international monetary fund credit line once again argentines found themselves in the middle of a currency crisis as for inflation it was still above 26 and that s low considering the current 57 annual rate sturzenegger now a senior partner at latus view an investment company focusing on fintech looked back on the events last year that left the government of president mauricio macri badly shaken in his first interview since leaving the post looking forward the tight monetary policy adopted by the current central bank head guido sandleris has a chance to succeed where for decades so many others failed in argentina sturzenegger said the disinflation process will be substantial fast stronger than anybody expects if the current monetary policy is kept in place sturzenegger 53 said in new york you could reach the end of the year with a monthly inflation rate around 1 argentina s consumer prices rose 3 1 in may from a month ago the slowest pace since january and off the 2019 high of 4 7 posted in march sturzenegger is convinced this time is different because the government has taken sizable fiscal consolidation while the financial system has finally digested a monetary shock that began last august when the bank started to drastically reduce its short term debt infusing cash into the economy and fuelling inflation he said the economy should stabilize and even be growing by the time of the presidential election in late october before gaining speed next year he added not wavering in the plan s execution will be key he said letting the peso float freely was one of his top achievements sturzenegger says it also led to his demise starting in june 2017 an argument began between the central bank and macri s administration over the bank s inflation goals and high interest rates macri s team wanted the bank to relax its targets which would make it easier to cut rates and boost the economy among other objectives sturzenegger lost the battle and on dec 28 2017 seated next to cabinet chief marcos pena the government announced the change in inflation targets markets reacted negatively interpreting the surprise move as macri meddling in monetary policy despite repeatedly saying the central bank was truly independent perhaps i lowered the guard a little bit at the end of 2017 i thought the economy was doing well the disinflation process was doing well he said the impact on our credibility was more like a permanent shock the dec 28 decision was the first in a series of events that sparked a currency crisis with the peso collapsing and the federal reserve raising interest rates credit markets essentially began to close for argentina which added pressure across the board more arguments ensued between sturzenegger and the government over the floating exchange rate ultimately leading to his resignation the biggest lesson of what happened is that you need to support having an independent central bank and i think a lot of the costs paid were the result of that sturzenegger concluded i don t see that lesson as being learned bloomberg

simply put the purchasing power parity is equalising the purchasing power of two currencies by taking into account the cost of living and inflation differences the gross domestic product gdp is a popular metric to calculate the size of a countryâ s economy the gdp by definition is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given financial year however the gdp figures do not account for the apparent differences in the cost of living in every country hence fluctuations in the exchange rates can push or pull a countryâ s gdp rankings every year without accounting for the changes in the standard of living advertisement hence the purchasing power parity ppp has become a preferred tool to compare economies based on their cost of living simply put the purchasing power parity is equalising the purchasing power of two currencies by taking into account the cost of living and inflation differences under this metric economists compare the quantity of currency one needed to purchase a given unit of a good or common basket of goods and services however it is difficult to compare the gdp of india and the united states on market exchange rates as it does not take into consideration the differences in the cost of living but adjusting the gdp figures with ppp help economists make a more valid comparison between economies in fact the gap between richer and poorer countries narrows when one accounts for the ppp the economist the london based magazine comes out with an interesting matrix called the big mac the matrix gives an idea about the ppp of every country based on the prices of mcdonaldâ s big mac burger for instance if a big mac in china costs 10 41 renminbi and 2 90 in the us then â according to ppp â the exchange rate should be 3 59 for 1 however if the renminbi is actually trading at 8 27 renminbi for 1 the big mac matrix would suggest that the renminbi is undervalued advertisement the ppp is calculated by the following formula s p1 p2 in the formula s represents the exchange rate of currency 1 to currency 2 p1 represents the cost of good x in currency 1 and p2 represents the cost of good x in currency 2 the world bank releases a report every three years that compares various countries in terms of the ppp and us dollars moreover the international monetary fund imf and organisation for economic co operation and development oecd base their economic analysis and prescriptions based on the ppp metrics gdp according to ppp advertisement while china 27 4 trillion is the largest economy in the world in terms of ppp the united states 21 4 trillion comes a distant second india is a distant third with a gdp adjusted to ppp at 11 4 trillion however in terms of nominal gdp the united states is the largest economy in the world followed by china japan is the third largest economy while germany and india occupy the fourth and fifth positions in the world

2 on a us dollar basis over the same period all performance figures are on a us dollar basis with net income reinvested our allocation to argentina was the largest contributor to returns in may as the market was up 14 buoyed by its re entry into the msci emerging markets index our holdings in financial banco macro 29 energy company ypf 10 and electric utility pampa energia 21 all rallied strongly we have trimmed exposure on strong performance while remaining positively positioned we hold little exposure to saudi arabia which also helped returns during the month may saw the saudi market entering the msci emerging markets index for the first time which saw the market give back some of its strong year to date gains 9 we continue to view the market as expensive on both absolute and relative measures as well as structurally challenged we note the very different reactions to the upgrades which we believe were driven by the very different valuation levels across the two markets additionally greek banks continued their run of strong performance with national bank of greece 21 and alpha bank 22 positioning in south east asian countries of malaysia philippines and indonesia were the top detractors from returns in may in addition to our holdings in kazakhstan our holding in british american tobacco malaysia 15 hurt returns post the release of weak first quarter earnings which showed a greater than expected decline in volumes in the philippines conglomerate lt group sold off 7 in spite of solid earnings results on the back of potential tobacco tax increases and investor concern around the funnelling of cash into a rights issue at bank subsidiary philippines national bank indonesian cement company semen indonesia was an additional detractor declining 14 after a weaker than expected earnings result our position in kazakhstan copper miner kaz minerals 24 also hurt returns as copper prices weakened we initiated a small position in pakistan in may as the country signed a us 6bn deal with the imf international monetary fund buying a position in private bank mcb we await to see what measures the country will put in place to tackle the challenges ahead including reducing fiscal spending as well as liberalizing their currency and interest rate regime but think that market valuations are already discounting significant headwinds we cut exposure in malaysia by selling our position in telekom malaysia as it neared our target price taking advantage of a very strong rally into month end 25 after the company reported much better than expected results elsewhere we took profits in vietnam and trimmed positions in argentina greece and romania which have worked well we rotated the proceeds into our preferred names which have underperformed we were in argentina in may visiting companies and policymakers our view remains that the economy should meet the conditions of its imf package it is the political outlook which is more uncertain in our view given cristina kirchner s decision to run as vice president with little known alberto fernandez as the presidential candidate whilst we continue to track the political developments closely we believe that valuations are sufficiently attractive to account for the risks we continue to find value in the smaller emerging and frontier markets and see the markets well supported by the lower rate

we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of epidemic proportions

order on enlist duo requests briefing on may 30 2019 the u s court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit issued an order in national family farm coalition v epa no 17 70810 filed mar 21 2017 regarding the scope of its review of a petition challenging a 2017 epa notice of pesticide registration this 2017 order addresses dow agrosciences llc s enlist duo product the petitioners include the national family farm coalition and the natural resources defense council the may 30 2019 order addresses whether the court could review two prior epa orders one issued in 2014 and one in 2015 regarding the registration of enlist duo those 2014 and 2015 epa orders had also been challenged in court and subsequently remanded to epa to consider additional information following epa s consideration of this additional information epa increased the allowed use sites for the enlist duo registration to include cotton and increased the number of states authorized to use enlist duo from 15 to 34 states the ninth circuit s may 30 2019 order finds that the 2017 order reissues the original enlist duo registration and amendment addressed in the 2014 and 2015 orders thus making the full registration of enlist duo for ge corn soybean and cotton for use in 34 states subject to review the court based its decision on the language of epa s 2017 order and epa s final registration decision the court found persuasive for example that epa s 2017 order states that it supercedes epa s 2014 order which the court stated is consistent with our determination that the 2014 order previously remanded to epa has now been finalized since epa identified its 2017 order as final and had characterized its 2014 and 2015 orders as having an incomplete record the court stated that it will review the 2017 order on the combined records of the 2014 2015 and 2017 orders all of which is incorporated into the 2017 order s record the court further noted that epa s 2017 order also purports to extend the 2014 registration s and that of the 2015 amendment initial 2020 expiration date by two years since the court found that nothing suggests that this term is specific to the new uses on ge cotton in 34 states or ge corn and soybean in the additional 19 states the court stated that the 2017 epa order could not have been limited to adding only these post 2015 uses as epa had asserted more

epcra require that any pfas subject to an existing significant new use rule snur under tsca be added to the tri the senators believe that this provision will apply to almost 200 of the 602 pfas that are currently in commerce require any pfas subject to an ongoing or future snur or finalized toxicity value including the ongoing review of the compound genx be added to the tri after the snur or toxicity value is issued in final direct epa to decide whether to add several additional specific pfas for addition to the tri within two years set the reporting threshold for pfas by entities subject to tri reporting at a level of 100 pounds house bill would require testing for pfas on may 16 2019 representative elissa slotkin d mi introduced the pfas monitoring act h r 2800 the bill would amend

revise definition of renewable biomass under rfs program on may 22 2019 senator ron wyden d or introduced a bill s 1614 to amend the caa to modify the definition of renewable biomass under the renewable fuel standard rfs the caa currently prohibits the use of biomass from federal lands in the making of renewable fuels as defined by the rfs the bill would allow the use of biomass from certain federal lands needing ecological restoration in the making of renewable fuels the bill also is intended to make it financially feasible for private landowners to remove low value brush that impact wildlife habitats and pose fire risks under the bill all mill residuals like sawdust and shavings can be used for biofuels and it requires biomass harvested from federal lands to be done in accordance with all federal laws regulations and land use plans and designations local water protection act introduced in senate on may 22 2019 senators amy klobuchar d mn and marco rubio r fl introduced legislation to reduce water pollution in local communities the local water protection act s 1604 would reauthorize an epa grant program to fund states to develop and implement programs for managing nonpoint source water pollution currently states retain the primary role for addressing nonpoint source water pollution caused by snowmelt and rainfall runoff which they do largely through voluntary means and financial incentives according to the government accountability office gao however available incentives have declined recently leading to increased water pollution the bill would reauthorize 200 million annually for the voluntary grant fund to give local and state governments flexibility to make conservation improvements aimed at decreasing water pollutants through

the risks associated with per and polyfluoroalkyl pfas as it considers a suite of senate bill proposals aimed at driving pfas regulation site clean up and filling data gaps on the presences of pfas in the environment and industrial releases of particular note the senate bill package includes companion legislation to house bills that would require designating pfas as hazardous substances under cercla see s 638 and would direct epa to develop a mcl and promulgate a national primary drinking water standard for pfas under the sdwa see s 1473 as currently drafted the legislative proposals do little to differentiate across the broad class of pfas chemistry in some cases such as the cercla proposal the legislation would circumvent established regulatory processes during the may 22 hearing the epw committee heard from witnesses representing state drinking water regulators the environmental working group ewg drinking water utilities and the american chemistry council acc the witness representing state drinking water regulators testified that the lack of information about associated risks and presence of pfas in the environment has hindered states ability to make regulatory decisions the drinking water utilities spokesperson tracy mehan also emphasized the need for more data and cautioned against bypassing established regulatory processes ewg s witness scott faber encouraged legislators to move forward with the cercla bill to expedite the clean up process and to hold the department of defense and industry responsible for contamination by legacy chemicals acc s witness dr kimberly white stressed that pfas differ greatly in their chemical properties and risk profiles and as such a one size fits all approach to regulation is not supported by science more

online senate bill would require a science based method to determine the cost of carbon pollution senator michael bennet d co on june 5 2019 re introduced legislation intended to blunt the trump administration s efforts to weaken climate protections the carbon pollution transparency act s 1745 is intended to ensure the federal government implements a science based process to account for the cost of carbon pollution in regulations through a standard metric the legislation is co sponsored by the majority of members of the senate democrats new special committee on the climate crisis senator bennet first introduced the bill in the last congress and the new version makes several updates including requiring all costs of climate change to be considered adjusting the values for inflation broadening the group of agencies involved in determining this metric and requiring impacts in environmental justice communities to be considered the bill reinstates a standardized metric and process to quantify the cost of climate pollution across federal agencies ensuring that federal decisions are transparent standardized and grounded in science and economics the bill would codify the most recent version of the federally determined climate pollution damage metric for carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide so all federal agencies are utilizing the same cost of carbon pollution in economically significant rulemaking it also would re establish a federal interagency working group to revise the cost of carbon pollution every five years if necessary the bill would establish a new scientific review committee comprised of ten members selected by the presidents of the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine the committee would provide input to the federal government on whether and how the cost of carbon pollution should be revised senate bill would block the use of funds to withdraw from paris climate agreement on june 5 2019 senator jeanne shaheen d nh introduced legislation seeking to ensure the u s meets its obligations under the paris climate agreement the international climate accountability act s 1743 would prevent the president from using

which the u s joined with nearly 200 other nations house subcommittee holds hearing to address the future of the epa on june 11 2019 the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation convened a hearing entitled critical mission former administrators address the direction of the epa four past epa administrators varying in political affiliation testified and wrote e are united that there has never been a more important time for us to put aside our differences and advocate collectively for public health and the environment energy and commerce chair frank pallone jr d nj ended his opening statement by stating more than ever our communities families and planet need a robust epa that is fully committed to protecting human health and the environment testifying at the hearing were gina mccarthy christine todd whitman william k reilly and lee m thomas member statements witness testimonies and an archived webcast of the hearing are available online gina mccarthy 2013 2017 stated in her written testimony that in my opinion our beloved epa is in serious trouble and if i am right it means that american families are facing increasing risks to their health and wellbeing especially the very young the elderly and those living in poverty that are most vulnerable to the impacts of pollution christine todd whitman 2001 2003 emphasized the need for environmental policy to be led by science rather than ideology whitman also placed large emphasis on the human related acceleration of climate change and the damaging effects it will have on oceans through a long history with epa william k reilly 1989 1993 expressed the urgency to address public health and natural resources to make the strides needed to improve epa needs to re establish the agency s scientific credibility by appointing well qualified scientists from key disciplines to advisory committees and to consider the full range of peer reviewed research and data bases that are relevant to questions at hand epa needs to be strong and replicable along with broad bipartisan support stated lee m thomas 1985 1989 thomas concluded by supporting rigorous oversight by the committee for sound decisions to be made and to provide a clearer direction regarding how to combat climate change house select committee holds hearing on renewable energy on june 13 2019 the house select committee on the climate crisis convened a hearing entitled solving the climate crisis ramping up renewables committee chair kathy castor d fl in her opening statement stated the climate crisis is daunting but the opportunities we have in front of us for good jobs clean air and a just future are boundless so it is a time for resolve and it is a time for hope we have the tools and technology we need to succeed we just need to decide to do it ranking minority member garrett graves r la added by stating that the regulatory process makes it difficult to increase renewables and that the science behind renewable energy needs to be balanced and complementary to promote the industry testifying before the committee were abigail ross hopper president and ceo solar energy industries association tom kiernan president and ceo american wind energy association christine tezak managing director of research clearview energy partners llc and katherine hamilton chair 38 north solutions hopper stated that solar energy is clean reliable and renewable solar currently provides 2 3 percent of the nation s electricity but that number is to rise to 20 percent by 2030 hopper recommended that the committee consider four main options including extending the investment tax credit investing in energy storage maintaining and expanding competition in electricity markets to allow competition for solar and investing in workforce developments hopper and kiernan both emphasized the need to modernize and invest in the outdated grid hamilton proposed flexible technology to retain more valuables from renewable resources this includes investing in energy storage plants to replace coal and gas grid scale solutions when questioned regarding the use of rare earth metals and the diverse issues involved when obtaining these metals from other regions of the world she suggested using innovative methods and practicing rare earth metal recycling tezak suggested designing chemical solutions which could replace these rare earth metals in the future the individuals testifying all emphasized ways to practice inclusion and diversity in the renewable energy industry hamilton stressed using thoughtfulness and a holistic outlook to implement renewable energy practices that best match community needs and resources coupled with tax credits for lower income communities miscellaneous california to commence proceedings to cancel chlorpyrifos applications on may 8 2019 the california environmental protection agency calepa announced that the california department of pesticide regulation dpr will be initiating cancellation proceedings of chlorpyrifos in its press release calepa states that the decision to commence cancellation proceedings follows mounting evidence including recent findings by the state s independent scientific review panel on toxic air contaminants that the pesticide causes serious health effects in children and other sensitive populations at lower levels of exposure than previously understood dpr s decision following years of review in california of chlorpyrifos is sure to garner significant controversy comments and potentially litigation chlorpyrifos first entered the comprehensive risk assessment process after being designated by dpr with a high priority status in 2011 and some of the dpr documents supporting the current action were issued in 2011 in december 2015 dpr released a draft risk assessment for public comment since the risk assessment identified potential human exposure to spray drift via inhalation or deposition as a concern dpr entered chlorpyrifos in its formal evaluation process to determine the scientific evidence for listing it as a pesticide toxic air contaminant tac ca food agric code 14021 14027 dpr s assessments were intended to evaluate chlorpyrifos as a pesticide tac as defined in california regulations title 3 section 6864 the determination of a pesticide tac is based on whether the air concentrations either measured or modeled exceed the reference concentration rfc divided by ten more information concerning chlorpyrifos is available in our blog usda issues proposal to modernize regulations for genetically modified organisms on june 6 2019 the u s department of agriculture s usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis issued a proposed ruleon the movement of certain genetically engineered ge organisms 84 fed reg 26514 the proposed rule would revise the regulations regarding the movement including the importation interstate movement and environmental release of certain ge organisms in response to advances in genetic engineering and aphis understanding of the plant pest risk posed by them thereby reducing regulatory burden for developers of organisms that are unlikely to pose plant pest risks aphis notes that the proposed rule would mark the first comprehensive revision of the regulations since they were established in 1987 it would provide a clear predictable and efficient regulatory pathway for innovators facilitating the development of new and novel organisms that are unlikely to pose plant pest risks comments on the proposed rule are due by august 5 2019 more information is available online in a related action president trump on june 11 2019 issued an executive order on modernizing the regulatory framework for agricultural biotechnology products eo the eo directs federal agencies to streamline the agricultural biotechnology regulatory processes the eo is intended to eliminate delays reduce developer costs and provide greater certainty about the review process for farmers the eo states that it is the policy of the federal government to protect public health and the environment by adopting regulatory approaches for the products of agricultural biotechnology that are proportionate responses to the risks such products pose and that avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions across like products developed through different technologies it directs federal agencies to base regulatory decisions on scientific and technical evidence and take into account as appropriate and consistent with applicable law economic factors agencies also must review regulatory applications for products of agricultural biotechnology in a timely and efficient manner the eo requires agencies to make regulatory determinations based on risks associated with the product and its intended end use and promote trade in products of agricultural biotechnology by urging trading partners to adopt science and risk based regulatory approaches the eo also requires the creation of a web based platform that contains and provides links to relevant regulatory information epa administrator orders review of cost benefit analysis methodology on may 13 2019 epa administrator andrew r wheeler issued a memorandum ordering epa offices to put together regulatory proposals for reviewing and revising the manner in which epa conducts cost benefit analyses the memorandum states that epa must ensure that its regulatory decisions are rooted in sound transparent and consistent approaches to evaluating benefits and costs it notes that many epa statutes require the consideration of benefits and costs as part of regulatory decision making but that epa has historically evaluated these benefits and costs differently depending on the media office air water land and the underlying authority this has resulted in various concepts of benefits costs and other factors that may be considered he wrote mr wheeler stated that his memorandum will initiate an effort to rectify these inconsistencies through statute specific actions eo 13777 enforcing the regulatory reform agenda directs agencies to identify regulations that impose costs that exceed benefits following the issuance of this eo epa opened a public docket to solicit feedback in april 2017 based on the eo and the comments received epa in june 2018 issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anprm to solicit public input on potential approaches for increasing consistency and transparency in how epa considers benefits and costs the memorandum directs the offices to develop regulatory proposals

pmra issued its proposed re evaluation decision prvd2019 05 chlorpyrifos and its associated end use products updated environmental risk assessment updated environmental risk assessment pmra states that this re evaluation considers data and information from pesticide manufacturers published scientific reports and other regulatory agencies and that health canada applies internationally accepted risk assessment methods as well as current risk management approaches and policies pmra is proposing the cancellation of most uses of chlorpyrifos including almost all agricultural uses due to pmra s belief that they pose unacceptable risks to the environment the proposal would allow a small number of uses to continue if certain label changes are made more specifically pmra states that its evaluation of available scientific information has not found acceptable risks to beneficial arthropods birds mammals and all aquatic biota in the environment for most current chlorpyrifos uses but reenhouse ornamental outdoor ornamentals container stock only for control of japanese beetle larvae indoor and outdoor structural adult and larval mosquito uses of chlorpyrifos have been shown to be acceptable from the environmental perspective the label changes that pmra states would be required for these uses to continue include the following 1 standard environmental hazard statements to inform users of the potential toxic effects to non target species and 2 standard environmental advisory statements for prevention of contamination of aquatic systems and to reduce volatilization more

on fatal gas well blowout on june 12 2019 the u s chemical safety and hazard investigation board csb released its final investigation report into the blowout that killed five workers at the pryor trust gas well in pittsburgh county ok csb s report identifies a lack of regulations governing onshore drilling safety and shortcomings in safety management systems and industry standards the report calls on regulators industry groups the state of oklahoma and companies to address such gaps csb determined that the cause of the blowout and rig fire was the failure of two preventive barriers intended to stop a blowout those were the primary barrier hydrostatic pressure in the well produced by drilling mud and the secondary barrier human detection of gas flowing into or expanding in the well and activation of the rig s blowout preventer the report explains that unplanned underbalanced drilling and tripping operations allowed a large quantity of gas to enter the well and safety critical operations used to determine if gas is in the well were not performed the report is available online president trump nominates member to csb on june 13 2019 president trump nominated

yves here this post describes how the forces driving the us suicide surge started well before the trump era but explains how trump has not only refused to acknowledge the problem but has made matters worse however it s not as if the democrats are embracing this issue either by rajan menon the anne and bernard spitzer professor of international relations at the powell school city college of new york and senior research fellow at columbia university s saltzman institute of war and peace studies his latest book is the conceit of humanitarian intervention originally published at tomdispatch we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of epidemic proportions

a war of words has erupted between donald trump and mario draghi over europe s efforts to boost its economy who s right advertisement a fresh war of words has erupted between the us president and the head of the european central bank ecb over whether the eurozone s efforts to help itself are unfair on the united states after mario draghi suggested additional stimulus would be required unless the european economy improved donald trump complained that such action would unfairly give europe an edge over the us the terse exchange comes as the economy in europe and beyond is reeling from the effects of a trade war between america and china what did draghi say the ecb president used a speech in portugal this week to hint strongly at more monetary support to boost flagging growth in the eurozone draghi said targets risked not being reached on inflation which looked like being too low in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required he said he went on to say the ecb would consider all measures including interest rate cuts and a further boost to its quantitative easing programme if the crisis has shown anything it is that we will use all flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future how did the markets and trump respond draghi s comments prompted the euro to fall around 0 5 against the dollar the us president lost no time in to cry foul mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others he said amid a surge in european stock markets and government bond prices trump added european markets rose on comments unfair to u s made today by mario d three hours later came another tweet german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states later the ecb president responded to trump s outburst to deny any attempt to manipulate the markets we have our mandate our mandate is price stability defined as a rate of inflation which is close but below two percent over the medium term we are ready to use all the instruments that are necessary to fulfil this mandate and we don t target the exchange rate draghi said why is the ecb considering more stimulus demand in the world economy has fallen as the us fights a trade war with china last month saw both sides slap more tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods europe has not escaped being caught up in the fallout economies relying on exports especially germany have been particularly exposed the ecb s decision to end its quantitative easing stimulus programme at the end of last year has also contributed to slower demand at home and abroad advertisement in may germany s jobless rate rose for the first time in more than five years albeit from a near 30 year low some analysts see this as clear evidence that the country is being caught in the us china crossfire earlier this month the bundesbank slashed its growth forecast there are fears that the rest of europe is also exposed is the ecb justified and would its action work so far the impact on european industry has been far stronger than on the rest of the economy spending has held up thanks to wage growth and fiscal measures taken in several countries including france and germany to boost household income however there are concerns that sectors other than manufacturing may soon be affected laurence boone chief economist at the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd has warned that services are likely to feel the pinch before long there is said to be scepticism among investors that the ecb has enough ammunition in its fight against inflation and that it can do more to kickstart growth advertisement mario draghi is due to step down later this year and it is possible that a successor will pursue a different strategy the european commission s latest growth forecast was relatively optimistic saying that domestic demand could carry the european economy through its recent slump but many forecasters believe that growth in the eurozone will have to be supported to revive the recovery unless washington and beijing resolve their differences soon more on this topic want more news
we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of epidemic proportions
the trade war between beijing and washington has stoked concern in financial markets that china might opt to weaponize its holdings of more than us 1 1 trillion worth of u s treasuries in retaliation for the tariffs the trump administration has imposed on chinese imports often referred to as the nuclear option choosing to dump so large a pool of assets would likely destabilize world financial markets drive interest rates higher and push tensions between the world s two largest economies into uncharted territory china has been slimming its treasury securities portfolio for some time but most analysts see an aggressive reduction of its holdings as a remote possibility at most there is no evidence beijing is seriously looking to flood markets with its u s bonds here are some key points about china s treasuries portfolio how much u s debt does china own about a decade ago china overtook japan as the largest foreign holder of u s government debt its holdings stood at more than us 1 12 trillion at the end of march according to u s treasury department data japan is a close second with nearly us 1 08 trillion china s holdings peaked in late 2013 at nearly us 1 32 trillion and have come down by about 15 per cent since then in march they were the lowest in about two years its share of the treasury market has fallen even faster because of the steady issuance of u s debt required to finance the growing federal budget deficit the world s second biggest economy owns about 7 per cent of the us 16 18 trillion of u s public debt outstanding its lowest share in 14 years and down from a peak of 14 per cent in 2011 still its slice of the pie is exceeded only by the u s federal reserve which owns us 2 15 trillion of treasuries or 13 5 per cent of the market treasury issuance is expected to keep accelerating after a massive tax cut enacted in december 2017 so china s share of the market will likely drop even further why does china own so much u s debt as a net exporter to the united states and the rest of the world china has the world s largest stash of foreign exchange reserves at more than us 3 trillion much of that is denominated in u s dollars accumulated through its persistent trade surplus with the united states since the early 1990s a natural place for china to park a lot of those greenbacks is the u s treasury market which is by far the largest and most liquid pool of safe assets in the world also since the financial crisis of 2007 09 u s treasuries have consistently yielded more than bonds issued by other large developed economies such as japan and germany which has been another lure what is the risk to the united states if china sells most analysts agree that large scale selling by beijing would disrupt the treasury market and other markets an abrupt shift in the balance of supply and demand could drive down treasury prices and drive up their yields which move in the opposition direction to prices that would cause a spike in borrowing costs for the u s government also because treasury yields are a benchmark for u s consumer and business credit interest rates on everything from corporate bonds to homeowners mortgages would rise likely slowing the economy such a jarring move would also erode global investors confidence in the u s dollar as the world s top reserve currency what is the risk to china if it dumps treasuries most analysts argue china has not opted to sell uncle sam s ious because a nosedive in u s bond prices also would bring down the value of china s remaining treasury holdings also china s currency the yuan is not fully free floating beijing uses its treasury holdings as a key tool to stabilize the yuan within a targeted range against the dollar in particular some critics have alleged china uses treasuries and its other currency reserves to hold down the yuan making its exports more attractive at the same time allowing the currency to cheapen too much risks other problems such as foreign capital flight any sharp depreciation in the greenback might force beijing to defend the yuan which may mean shedding more of its treasuries stake back in 2016 china s treasuries holdings fell sharply by some us 200 billion from may to november of that year as the yuan depreciated on worries about the chinese economy lastly any knock on effect in the u s economy would also be felt in china because the united states is the destination for nearly a fifth of chinese exports

it was draghi s strongest indication yet of concern about the global economy and it came as the federal reserve s policymaking committee began meeting in washington amid expectations it could also resume cutting interest rates additional stimulus will be required unless the stress on the eurozone economy eases mario draghi the central bank s president told an audience of economists he added that the bank was prepared to use all the monetary policy weapons at its disposal including de facto money printing to forestall a recession sintra portugal a global shift back to easy money policies reminiscent of the last financial crisis gathered force tuesday after the european central bank signaled it was poised to step up its stimulus to the eurozone economy in response to international tensions and the trade war advertisement draghi s remarks brought a rebuke from president trump who accused the central bank president of manipulating currency rates they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others the president said on twitter get trendlines a business newsletter from globe columnist larry edelman covering the trends shaping business and the economy in boston and beyond enter email sign up only a few months ago central banks were putting the brakes on their fast growing economies or in the european central bank s case unwinding emergency measures put in place during the last crisis but now the policymakers who manage monetary policy are reversing direction in the face of new threats to growth including trump s trade war escalating tension between the united states and iran and rising fear of recession the euro declined sharply against the dollar after draghi s speech but he denied trump s accusation that he was deliberately trying to give european companies an unfair advantage a weaker euro tends to make european cars machine tools or wine less expensive for customers paying in dollars we don t target the exchange rate draghi said to applause from the economists and central bankers gathered at a golf resort here for the european central bank s annual forum on central banking advertisement trump s contention that the european central bank s actions are unfair and his consistent belief that the federal reserve should lower rates and weaken the dollar underlines his views of the global economy as a winner takes all system in which other countries are cheating if they work at cross purposes to his own agenda the fed s policymakers whose meeting ends wednesday are expected to leave rates unchanged but many economists predict they will signal that they are willing to cut rates soon if a slowing global economy and escalating trade tensions threaten the outlook for us growth trump has long fixated on what the euro and china s currency are doing relative to the us dollar and how monetary policy at home and abroad fits in he tweeted about the lack of a level playing field last year and his adviser peter navarro made similar attacks on germany for currency manipulation before that draghi has defended euro area monetary policy saying that it reacts to economic fundamentals the fed and other global central banks guide their domestic economies by moving short term interest rates and by buying bonds those moves cause their national currencies to adjust but policymakers rarely explicitly target such moves for fear of being labeled currency manipulators such an approach is critical in a globalized economy with freely floating currencies it is intended to allow major nations keep economic activity operating at an even keel without resulting in tit for tat currency battles that become a race to the bottom and risk ignoring other monetary policy goals like controlling inflation advertisement draghi had signaled earlier this month that the european central bank was becoming increasingly willing to revive stimulus measures used to combat a debt crisis that began in 2010 but in a panel discussion at the central banking forum tuesday he made it clear that his statements during a speech earlier in the day signaled a significant shift in response to a climate of pervasive economic uncertainty draghi had signaled previously that the central bank would act if the economic situation worsened but now the reverse is true the central bank will act unless the situation gets better this is exactly because of that lingering uncertainty that by itself is a materialization of risk draghi said

overview risk taking was bolstered by the dramatic shift in draghi s rhetoric less than two weeks after the ecb meeting and a trump s tweet announcing that there was going to be an extended meeting between him and xi at the g20 meeting and that the respective staff would begin coordinating it was later confirmed by the chinese media today s focus is on the fomc barring a rate cut that would surprise the focus is the extent to which the statement and powell manage market expectations the one two punch of draghi and trump lit a fire to equities in europe and the us asia followed suit with the msci asia pacific index up the most in five months european equities are consolidating yesterday s gains and us shares also are little changed the same meme is evident in the bond markets where asia pacific played catch up while european and us bond yields edge higher after yesterday s sharp decline the dollar is little changed against the majors with the antipodeans trading a little softer most emerging market currencies are firmer the turkish lira is the notable exception as both the us and europe are considering sanctions the us is contemplating action to express its disapproval of turkey a nato member for buying a russian missile system while europe disapproves its drilling activity in the southeast part of the mediterranean south korea and taiwan currencies led the emerging market currencies with 0 8 and 0 6 gains respectively asia pacific us japanese trade talks are underway and today s data illustrates the challenge simply put the days of japan s large trade surplus driving the current account surplus are history japan reported that after a three month surplus the trade balance returned to deficit in the first five months of the year japan has recorded an average monthly shortfall of almost jpy300 mln in the same period last year the average deficit was near jpy30 mln the current account like switzerland s for example is driven by the investment income balance profits interest dividends licensing fees royalties etc japan reported its sixth consecutive year over year decline in exports the 7 8 decline is the largest since january last may exports rose by 8 1 year over year chips and auto parts were important export drags 30 and 12 respectively in terms of destination exports to china were off 9 7 year over year in may and down 6 3 in april exports to the rest of asia fell 13 4 after a 1 6 decline in april exports to the eu were down by 7 1 but exports to the us rose by 3 3 imports unexpectedly fell by 1 5 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a 1 0 gain the weakness is seen as a reflection of the soft domestic economy the boj meeting concludes tomorrow and no change is expected though pressure may be building for some technical adjustments given that it owns around 80 of the 7 10 year bonds and there is concern that it is disrupting activity for the eighth consecutive session the us dollar sits on a jpy108 handle over this run the dollar has finished the north american session roughly within 10 ticks of jpy108 45 there are nearly 1 2 bln in options struck between jpy108 30 jpy108 40 that expires today there is a hefty 3 bln option struck at jpy108 that will also be cut while volatility around the fomc announcement may challenge the range sizeable option expiries tomorrow may reinforce the range tomorrow sees 1 6 bln options at jpy108 and 1 2 bln at jpy109 roll off the australian dollar initially made a marginal new high for the week before turning lower the aussie had approached 0 6900 where an a 512 mln option that expires today has been struck initial support is now pegged near 0 6860 the us dollar briefly traded below cny6 90 for the first time in two weeks but eventually edged slightly higher on the day europe there can be little doubt draghi s comments were impromptu the ecb president knew exactly what he was doing and he noted in a panel discussion that it was a deliberate recalibration of the message from the ecb meeting two weeks ago there are three important takeaways first the bar to moving on policy is low it does not require a deterioration of conditions merely the lack of improvement anonymous sources told bloomberg that a rate cut would be the likely first step even though draghi indicated that there was also scope to re start asset purchases if needed second the ecb has made the judgment that uncertainty will linger and this uncertainty is itself the materialization of risk third the us president s claim that the ecb was manipulating the currency were rebuffed and more part of what is ailing the eurozone is the weakening of global growth for which tariffs and disruptive trade practice play an import role the ecb may need to react further and the market understood draghi to signal a rate cut in h2 19 rather than in h2 20 as previously discounted part of the uncertainty comes from europe though too brexit uncertainty has increased the risks of an exit without a deal have appeared to have risen the tory leadership battle continues johnson is seen as the hardest brexit candidate left rory stewart is perceived to have the mildest stance and he practically doubled his votes round 2 a johnson stewart choice for the 160k members of the conservative party would therefore arguably be the widest range one consideration that has emerged that the commitment to leaving on october 31 is not ironclad johnson has appeared to soften his rhetoric by sounding more ambivalent meanwhile labour seems to be evolving to a more decisive remain position and a referendum under all circumstances sterling was bid before the inflation data and spiked to session highs 1 2580 before pulling back the may cpi was in line with expectations cpih rose 1 9 year over year 2 0 in april the core rate slipped to 1 7 from 1 8 which is the lowest since january 17 the boe meets tomorrow and is expected to stand pay sterling needs to resurface above 1 26 to stabilize the technical tone the euro is in a tight range the bears want to see a better level to sell while the bulls were chastened by draghi optionality may also deter the upside consider that there are around 5 7 bln euros in options struck between 1 1175 and 1 1210 that will expire today of those options 3 3 bln are between 1 1200 and 1 1210 america we did not think that a trump xi meeting would materialize but there have been some noises in recent days that suggested some movement was afoot china s vice foreign minister was in washington d c over the weekend because the staffs will meet first do some heavy lifting it won t be the impromptu unscripted event in which we recognized would not suit xi the role of domestic american political considerations should almost be factored into the equation while us election experts would caution against paying much attention to the polls at this stage in the cycle the president does and recently fired is polling team but not after polls showed biden running well ahead in many states including in the midwest other democrat candidates would also give trump a run for his money so to speak ultimately even if ironically enough people around trump must recognize that the biggest threat to the economy which is the main factor leading some wall street economists to forecast trump s re election is the tariffs with china an escalation would undermine the economy which sucks the wind from his broader agenda perhaps a short term trade deal may be politically more advantageous than standing on ceremony and demanding one deal that resolves all the multi dimensional complexities mnuchin s deal from last year might not look so bad trump s language has changed from wanting a grand deal or no deal the us president now says a fair deal is desired with unemployment at a generation low the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker anticipating another quarter of above trend growth the case of an immediate cut may not be compelling however powell we suspect has learned from miscues and likely wants to indicate that the fed will act appropriately when needed the fed will probably acknowledge that crosscurrents remain powerful and that officials are taking it into account given the aggressiveness of the easing priced in the january 2020 fed funds futures contract implies an effective average rate of 1 765 compared with the current rate of 1 38 this means two cuts have been fully discounted and half of a third move fed officials will update their forecasts and some insight into how transitory they think the softness in price pressures last may be gleaned canada reports may cpi today and a small increase is expected it is unlikely to be much of a market factor it is overshadowed by the fomc meeting and friday s retail sales report may be more important for investor sentiment the bank of canada meets next on july 10 and is steadfastly on hold the us dollar recorded a potential key downside reversal by making a new high for the move a two week high before turning lower and finishing below the previous day s low the us dollar extended yesterday s losses to cad1 3365 but is quiet in narrow ranges initial support is seen around cad1 3350 a move above cad1

we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of epidemic proportions
scrubbed from the pages of glossy coffeetable books the history of u s imperialism can be found in the archives of wall street s oldest largest and most powerful institutions a deep dive into the vaults and ledgers of banking houses such as citigroup inc and j p morgan chase and co reveals a story of capitalism and empire whose narrative is not of morally pure and inspiring economic growth technological innovation market expansion and shareholder accumulation but rather of blood and labor stolen sovereignty and pilfered resources military occupation and monetary control sugar comingles with blood chain gangs cross spur lines and the magical abstractions of finance are found vulgarized in the base manifestations of racial capitalism the caribbean archipelago was ground zero for u s imperial banking this history of bankers and empire is also a caribbean history the caribbean archipelago was ground zero for u s imperial banking wall street s first experiments in internationalism occurred in cuba haiti panama puerto rico the dominican republic and nicaragua often with disastrous results for those countries and colonies and often for the imperial banks themselves yet where there was expansion there was also pushback the internationalization of wall street was met with local resistance refusal and revolt and just as the history of imperialism has been excised from popular narratives so too has this history of caribbean anti imperialism and autonomy the history of imperial banking and racial capitalism begins at the end of the nineteenth century at the

unprecedented wealth and boosted by the expansionist jingoism following the victory over spain in the caribbean and the pacific new york city s bankers and merchants believed that the organization of

bank from a merchant bank into a modern financial department store creating a new managerial structure expanding into new financial markets and exploring the possibilities of foreign expansion and international banking the most important theater of internationalization was the american mediterranean as one city banker described the countries and colonies ringing the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico there the bank experimented with the issuance of sovereign debt the ﬁnancing of international trade the funding of industrial infrastructure and the organization of regional state banks and currency systems beginning in 1914 it also made the caribbean the centerpiece of the largest foreign branch bank system of any u s banking house with cuba the jewel in its crown law was critical to city bank s internationalization and expansion as part of its efforts city bank hammered away at the banking regulations shackling its activities and pushed for regulatory reform while creating new subsidiary organizations that could navigate the complex regulatory geographies of international finance or simply evade existing legal constraint wall street lawyer john sterling of shearman and sterling worked closely with stillman and vanderlip while other firms worked to devise the colonial methods by which the imperial banks operated race was central to city bank s work too in its encounters with the nations and colonies of the caribbean and latin america wall street helped reorder those economies along racial lines exporting the u s racist imaginaries in which wall street was embedded and through which it functioned when conducting business in the caribbean u s bankers understood people of color whether africans or indigenous peoples through the same racist lenses they viewed them through at home white representations of african americans in particular were exported to the west indies and inscribed in a vast and diffuse archive of pamphlets reports circulars press releases prospectuses and journal articles produced by wall street about the caribbean and latin america at the same time in their dispatches back to the united states bankers translated the caribbean to u s businesspeople investors and the general public in some cases they debunked stereotypes as a means to encourage investment in others they replicated and reconstituted racial stereotypes in order to further the expansion of white supremacist control of the region with returns to investment found not in the extraction of capital values but in the ledger of white racial dominance wall street helped reorder the economies of the caribbean and latin america along racial lines one example of this practice can be found in city bank vice president john h allen one of the new slate of managers and vice presidents appointed by vanderlip as part of the bank s modernization of its bureaucracy allen aided the bank s expansion into cuba and argentina and was the manager of the city bank controlled banque nationale de la république d haiti in the 1910s in the city bank s foreign trade journal the americas allen evoked a picture of haiti that would have been recognizable to white u s audiences but for its tropical setting cock ﬁghting and card playing allen asserted are the national pastimes and these together with a supply of haitian rum are all that is necessary for a haitian citizen s perfect day he claimed that during his visits to haiti he found that humorous incidents were of almost daily occurrences for allen such incidents showed the naivete and also the restricted mentality of the people which latter was plainly noticeable even among the more highly educated these anecdotes did not exist in a vacuum they were not an incidental cultural membrane stretched over the inner workings of banking racial capitalism and imperialism instead they contributed to the fundamental ideological and cultural rationales that made the caribbean the target of wall street s imperial aims and at the same time helped fashion the terms through which the caribbean was encountered these representations were underwritten by both direct and indirect forms of violence by coercive diplomacy military force and labor impressment as well as by the terms and conditions of credit and debt the imbalanced application of law and legal regulation and the imposition of modern forms of post emancipation ﬁnancial governance indeed allen himself was deeply involved with the decision to send u s marines to haiti in 1915 in what would become a nineteen year military occupation city bank had been interested in haitian investments since about 1910 and vanderlip sought to use some initial railway and dock investments as a springboard to control the republic s financial system haiti s internal political conflicts fueled in part by outside agitation and interference from both u s and european speculators created disastrous terms for business in response city bank s roger l farnham who viewed the haitian people as nothing but grown up children who required the paternalistic guidance of a stronger power drafted a document arguing for u s military intervention to stabilize the country and protect u s financial and commercial interests the farnham plan as it was dubbed was realized in 1915 when marines landed to restore order following the assassination of haitian president vilbrun guillaume sam the occupation provided the platform for city bank s takeover of the banque nationale while making city bank s imposition of a 30 million loan to the haitian government almost risk free vanderlip described haiti as a small but profitable piece of business for city bank but such profits came at a cost the suppression of a series of peasant insurgencies that left thousands of haitians dead and dozens of villages burned hundreds of haitians were jailed or forced to work on chain gangs serving as a reminder to many haitians of the days of slavery city bank was not the only u s ﬁnancial institution charting an imperial turn it was joined by its neighbors on wall street sometimes as collaborators involved in a collective project to consolidate the ﬁnancial realms of the u s imperium sometimes as rivals embroiled in bitter competition chase manhattan bank for instance made an aggressive push to displace city bank in panama while fighting city bank for pride of place in the financing of the dictatorship of gerardo machado y morales in cuba meanwhile wall street s unincorporated and private investment banks including j p morgan and co speyer and co and kuhn loeb and co began ﬂoating the public debt of caribbean latin american and asian countries states and municipalities and ﬁnancing railroad and port projects these private bankers had initially grown in prominence by using their strong european networks and their close family ties as the conduit to market u s government bonds and corporate securities across the atlantic now increasingly they sold caribbean and latin american debt in the united states the domestic crisis of ﬁnance capitalism in the united states became a crisis of racial capitalism in the caribbean private bankers came to play an important role in the policy of dollar diplomacy initiated by president william howard taft and his secretary of state philander knox in the 1910s in the attempt to displace european inﬂuence and extend u s capitalism in the caribbean which purported to replace military intervention with ﬁnancial diplomacy private bankers worked with ﬁnancial experts and local governments to refund sovereign debt reorganize customs collection and currency systems and organize nominally national government banks the disordered global ﬁnancial and economic conditions unleashed by world war i accelerated the internationalization of wall street and intensiﬁed the relationship between banking bankers and imperialism but the expansion and this initial experiment in imperial banking was short lived the sharp economic crisis following the postwar commodity boom forced a brief retreat from internationalization prompting many wall street institutions including city bank to rethink their strategies for expansion meanwhile the local banking sector in cuba was completely destroyed of course by the end of the 1920s another crisis had occurred the concussions of the october 1929 stock market crash were felt not only domestically but throughout the international branch and subsidiary networks of wall street perhaps most acutely in the caribbean the domestic crisis of ﬁnance capitalism in the united states became a crisis of racial capitalism in the caribbean as wall street s financial edifice imploded so too did the racial bolsters on which it was constructed a wave of anti imperialist and anti wall street sentiment rose across the caribbean manifested in the withdrawal of funds from foreign banks editorials in local newspapers attacking the monopoly presence worker takeover of foreign controlled sugar mills bombings of bank buildings calls for the nationalization or indigenization of foreign owned banks and in the case of cuba calls for the renunciation of foreign debt these assertions of sovereignty were not only a claim for economic independence they were also a rejection of the governing tropes of racial paternalism moreover the rejection of ﬁnance capitalism and imperial banking served as a rejection of white supremacy and the obliteration of the circular logic associating whites with wealth and wealth with whites the desire to break the hold and allure of city bank and other u s banking and investment firms meant a challenge to the divine laws of racial capitalism in these calls for the nationalization or indigenization of state banking and in the cries to default on sovereign debt was a refusal to be governed through the implicitly hierarchal and implicitly racialized international orders that had subordinated these countries to the united states it was also an effort to critique the registers of proﬁtmaking and accumulation through which the caribbean labor that produced products especially sugar was obscured shrouded and hidden in the commodity form itself the radical journalist carleton beals captured this process in the crime of cuba 1933 his account of u s ﬁnance capital of chase bank and city bank and the machado dictatorship early in the book in his discussion of the racialized political economy of sugar beals evokes karl marx s description of the commodity as a social hieroglyphic whose meaning is only revealed through exegetical means for most americans cuba is but the hieroglyphic of a ticker beals writes amer sugar 26 5 8 cub amer sugar 17 1 7 cub am pfd 18 1 5 he goes further unpacking or deciphering the meaning of sugar as the story of the capture of black labor power but for me beals writes all this inner mystery is forever imprisoned in each cube of white sugar i drop into my morning coffee black cuba and black sweat and black song and dance crystallized into a snow cube held in silver prongs the caribbean s rejection of ﬁnance capitalism and imperial banking served as a rejection of white supremacy often such critiques occurred under the guises of the communist party and the comintern especially through their efforts to build a global movement of radical black labor the literature and propaganda of black communists at this time linked racial or what was called national oppression of black workers to ﬁnance capital and imperialism the pages of the negro worker for instance contained denunciations of city bank s involvement in haiti alongside accounts of black labor exploitation and colonial oppression across the african diaspora the magazine was published under the auspices of the international trade union s committee of negro workers a branch of the red international labour union and an appendage of the comintern tasked with mobilizing black labor in worldwide class struggle against global capitalism the paper s one time editor george padmore also cataloged global conditions of black exploitation in his life and struggles of negro toilers published in 1931 padmore was a young black trinidadian functionary for the communist party s negro wing and a proliﬁc writer life and struggles of negro toilers presents a sweeping comparative account of the conditions suffered by black people in africa and the african diaspora and includes attacks on early twentieth century u s expansionism overseas and with it the transformation of haiti and the dominican republic and liberia and abyssinia into colonies of u s ﬁnance capital padmore assails city bank s imposition of debt on the dominican republic and the transformation of haiti into an american slave colony during the u s occupation he lambasts the black ivory trade the conscription of haitian workers to the cuban plantations of the general sugar company and the united fruit company he argues that haitians were brought to the country in the same ways as chattel slaves of former days haitians were underpaid indebted to their contractors and housed in segregated and unsanitary barracoons in padmore s writing ﬁnance capitalism was racial capitalism similar critiques were implicit in jacques roumain s novel masters of the dew 1941 the founder of the haitian communist party roumain was jailed during the waning days of the u s occupation masters of the dew centers on a haitian bracero who returns to his country from cuba and attempts to rebuild haiti through collective labor and a call for black autonomy for roumain the collective pull of the coumbite farmers cooperative replaces the coercive push of the corvée forced labor gang at the same time u s banking and corporate interests became the subject of a radical anti imperialist caribbean literature a literature that can be viewed as a counterpoint to the rhetoric of city bank and attempts by wall street to visualize the caribbean to borrow allen s term for the purposes of exploitation and accumulation cuban poet nicolás guillén s west indies ltd 1934 for instance satirically attacks the corporate transformation of the caribbean into the grotesque headquarters of companies and trusts in nicaraguan novelist s hernán robleto s los estrangulados 1933 the brown brothers and j w seligman controlled banco nacional de nicaragua and the mercantile bank of the americas compañía mercantil de ultramar feature as dominant and domineering institutions undermining the economic independence of the nicaraguan elite through its loaning practices langston hughes wrote of the role of city bank not only in haiti but also in cuba he evokes the transitions from mercantilism to imperialism and colonialism to neocolonialism in cuba s history and offers a glum assessment of the ability of the little fort of san lazaro standing sentinel at the entrance to havana s harbor facing the caribbean sea and the united states to repel the pillaging of ﬁnance capitalism but now writes hughes against a pirate called the national city bank what can you do alone pushback against racial capitalism did not occur only under the auspices of the communist party caribbean intellectuals also turned inward to seek out an autochthonous anti imperial critique that was the precursor to the philosophy of négritude this phenomenon was perhaps most pronounced in haiti for the haitian elite the utter humiliation of the u s occupation forced them to rethink their identities their longstanding identiﬁcations with france and european enlightenment thought and culture proved an absurdity in the face of the brutal racism of the u s occupation many among them realized they were suffering from what jean price mars called a collective bovarism a deluded and misrecognized sense of self the haitian elite slowly realized that europe was not their home africa was price mars s ainsi parla l oncle an ethnological exploration of the culture and folklore of the haitian peasantry and its african origins published in port au prince in 1927 helped spur the development of insurgent literary and national cultures in the caribbean and throughout the african diaspora cuba turned to blackness as an alternative to racial capitalism in cuba this turn to blackness as an alternative to racial capitalism took on multiple and contradictory forms in the early 1920s writers such as jesús masdeu in la raza triste 1924 depicted the black workers in the cuban sugar mills in sentimental romantic and often paternal tones the racial paternalism began to slip away in la danza de los millones 1923 venezuelan expatriate rafael antonio cisneros s experimental novel with its efforts at narrating the effects of the banking crisis of 1920 21 on his black characters in la zafra 1926 a collection of combat poems cuba s agustín acosta recounted the effects of the sugar boom and bust on the country linking ﬁnance capital to racial capitalism and sugar to blackness money and the poison of u s empire acosta made this explicit in the poem la danza de los millones it evokes the incursion of the instruments and techniques of u s ﬁnance capital into the cuban economy portraying it as a turbulent sea threatening to capsize the ship of cuba s sovereignty acosta warned of wall street with its usurious bankers in the novel écue yamba ó written by a young alejo carpentier while in machado s prison in 1927 blackness was rendered as the soul of cuban culture and an african alterity became the terms of a critique of imperialism and white ﬁnance el bongo carpentier wrote antídoto de wall street the antidote to wall street did not prove to be a cure certainly changes occurred and the crises of the 1930s forced wall street to rethink the organization of ﬁnance capital and the project of internationalization in a new era of governance regulation and sovereignty in haiti city bank sold the banque nationale to the haitian government but kept its management structure and its ties to wall street in place in the dominican republic city bank s branches became the basis for a national banking system but u s capital still dominated the country in cuba attempts to renounce chase bank s debts and default on amortization payments were stalled by the cuban courts and it would take another three decades before wall street was finally expelled from the country meanwhile city bank and chase bank would spend the next decades struggling to return to the heady days of unregulated expansion and unbounded freedom that characterized the early twentieth century history of imperial banking writing anew the caribbean ledger of finance and racial capitalism note this essay is adapted and reprinted

securities on the fed statement few expected the fed to cut rates today but there was a remarkable shift in the number of members who expect the next move in interest rates will be down and the most dovish member bullard dissented on the decision believing the fed should have cut rates at this meeting the majority of members expect to cut rates 25 basis points next year with the median dot for 2020 50 basis points lower than its march level we have recently shifted our own forecast in favour of fed rate cuts given increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook thanks largely to tensions on the trade front today s projections make clear that the fed is not too far away from our own view and has committed to act is need be oxford economics on the fed as expected the fomc kept the fed funds target range unchanged at 2 25 2 5 however fed officials dovish forward guidance and significantly lower fed funds dot plot estimates in 2019 leave open the possibility of a 25 basis point rate cut as soon as july advertisement oxford also said the dot plot estimates were more dovish than we expected the median interest rate forecast for 2019 barely remained at 2 38 as it was just one vote away from declining seven out of the 17 fed officials are looking for two 25 basis point rate cuts this year while one sees a 25 basis point rate cut eight officials look for rates to be on hold while one looks for a rate hike for 2020 the median estimate calls for a 25 basis point rate cut to 2 13 mid point of fed funds range followed by a 25 basis point rate hike in 2021 rbc capital markets on the fed clearly there is a low hurdle for the fed to ease but even with a low hurdle there still needs to be justification as powell said if developments over the inter meeting period lack of progress on trade is clearly high on the list suggest they should cut they will but we think the opposite is also true that the events of coming weeks are likely to dictate whether they cut or not makes the current make up of the dots interesting there are two factions right now and they are pretty close to evenly split about half are looking for 50bps of cuts in 2019 but about half are also looking for no cuts it is much easier for members to consolidate into one of these camps than it would be for the fed to come in today with broad consensus for a cut in 2019 and then to have to back off of that if trade developments improved this distribution gives them credibility cover it also suggests the fed either stands pat for the balance of the year again contingent on how big the tail risk from trade is or they cut 50 basis points but nothing in between on this it is worth noting that powell was receptive to the idea that when rates are so low and in the effective lower bound era it makes more sense to cut harder sooner so that there is a relatively high market probability of about 1 3 that we get a 50bps cut in july seems about right but this should also get a significant

table of contents what we know about libra how will this work what libra mean for the crypto market a lightning rod for regulation the ripple effects of facebook s big pivot photo by justin sullivan getty images facebook s long rumored cryptocurrency finally got its big debut and it s called libra after all facebook today released a lengthy white paper along with a post from mark zuckerberg and another from vp of blockchain david marcus announcing the ambitious crypto initiative and all that comes with it the open source libra cryptocurrency and blockchain will be governed by the nonprofit libra association while a new facebook owned subsidiary called calibra will release a wallet for libra tokens and ultimately other banking and finance products a move that could turn facebook into a financial services giant in addition to a social and advertising one while the public launch of libra won t happen until the first half of 2020 the developer testnet of the libra blockchain is live today there will also be a new programming language called move for developers to build distributed applications atop the libra blockchain though facebook said neither itself nor the libra foundation will be in charge of vetting and approving apps meaning there could be the potential for fraudulent or scam apps we ve heard rumblings about a secret blockchain project since last may when cheddar s alex heath reported that facebook had been exploring blockchain and the creation of its own cryptocurrency for use within its apps since 2017 facebook s goal is to launch a virtual token allowing anyone in the world and particularly billions of unbanked individuals who don t have bank accounts but do have smartphones the ability to make seamless digital payments and transfers both inside and out of facebook s apps there s a staggering amount of technical detail to how the permissioned libra blockchain works read not completely open like bitcoin and ethereum and how the libra association will keep the price stable using a reserve asset pool tied to multiple currencies including the dollar pound euro swiss franc and yen but for consumers wary of trusting their money and financial data to a company known for privacy problems there are a few important points facebook is hammering home with libra not only is it ceding control of the blockchain but facebook s social data and libra s financial data will be kept entirely separate you don t need a facebook or whatsapp account to use libra or sign up for calibra while users will be vetted for anti fraud protection when setting up an account like other blockchains there will be no personal information associated with libra and all transactions will be encrypted facebook can t take the data from your transaction history and use it to target ads or sell you products what we know about libra cheddar reported in december that facebook was on a hiring spree led by marcus the ex paypal president who formerly served as vp of facebook s messaging products marcus an early bitcoin investor who serves on the coinbase board confirmed he was leaving messenger to focus on heading a small group to explore how to best leverage blockchain across facebook starting from scratch the team has grown from a dozen members to more than 50 employees including the former team behind blockchain startup chainspace which facebook acquired in february facebook explored a number of different avenues while figuring out exactly how the financial side of its cryptocurrency will work after meeting with dozens of financial institutions and tech companeis about backing its token including zuckerberg s old friends the winklevoss twins facebook decided to give up absolute control by setting up an independent governance body called the libra association based out of geneva switzerland to oversee the token the 27 founding members of the libra assocation paid a minimum of 10 million to operate a node on facebook s blockchain underlying the token which will be a stablecoin meaning facebook s cryptocurrency will have a stable price during payments and transactions backed by a number of different global currencies beyond just the us dollar facebook employees will reportedly have the option of taking the cryptocurrency as part of their salaries at launch and for the foreseeable future libra will not be a permissionless blockchain other cryptocurrencies meaning that it s not truly decentralized not just anyone can set up a node and join the blockchain facebook said it couldn t figure out how to make a permissionless blockchain scalable to the number of transactions libra is expected to see upwards of 1 000 per second libra has a vague plan to transition to a permissionless system within five years but for now the association will focus on adding new vetted members photo by justin sullivan getty images every company operating a node will be part of the decentralized foundation governing the token as for who facebook has courted to invest 10 million for a node and join the libra association the wall street journal originally reported that marcus recruited his old friends at paypal along with visa mastercard and uber also participating in facebook s crypto payments network are online payments giant stripe argentinian e commerce marketplace mercadolibre and booking com the block obtained a full list of companies involved now confirmed by facebook the libra association s membership also counts venture capital firms including andreessen horowitz and union square ventures other popular apps and websites like ebay lyft and spotify telecommunications corporations such as vodafone nonprofits and blockchain companies including leading crypto exchange coinbase in addition to buying nodes the companies co signed the white paper one sector that didn t jump at the opportunity is wall street firms including goldman sachs and jpmorgan reportedly passed and there no big banks signed on at launch at least three companies chose not to partner with facebook due to data usage concerns coindesk reported how will this work the short answer is that it s very very complicated the tokens be transferrable at low to no cost according to zuckerberg between messenger instagram whatsapp and other facebook owned apps and services so for users who need to send money to friends within the facebook ecosystem the coin could serve as a way for facebook to undercut services like venmo and apple pay cash acquiring chainspace helps facebook on the transactional side the startup was working on decentralized smart contracts to facilitate faster blockchain based payments the cryptocurrency is also key to facebook s grand e commerce designs facebook is building out a network of businesses and merchants to accept libra as payment and facebook plans to make its cryptocurrency available to exchange from traditional currency through physical atm machines as well small businesses and merchants who accept libra will also be able to offer discounts and promotions for signing up new users as well as cut down on transaction fees compared to traditional credit card processors the most ambitious aspect of the stablecoin may be its potential to tie the global financial system together through a single crypto asset laura mccracken facebook s head of financial services and payment partnerships for northern europe first told a german business magazine that libra won t be tied to any single fiat currency but will be linked to multiple currencies to prevent volatility for a tl dr of how the crypto finances work the number of libra tokens will always correspond exactly to the pool of physical currency backing it when a user transfers money for libra new tokens are created when they cash out the token is destroyed the tokens are pegged to a pool of reserve currencies which the libra association can adjust based on world markets to ensure there aren t volatile swings in libra s value what members like visa mastercard uber and spotify get out of the arrangement are dividends on the interest generated by libra s pool of reserve currency as well as the ability to offer discounts and incentives for customers to pay in libra the calibra wallet will be built into messenger and whatsapp but will also be available as a standalone app for android and ios facebook sees calibra as just one of many third party wallets that consumers can choose from to hold their libra tokens there aren t too many blockchain companies in the association at launch but coinbase s participation is a signal to other wallet apps that may think about supporting libra calibra will launch with the same verification and anti fraud processes used by banks and credit cards and facebook will have automated monitoring to detect fraud and potentially offer refunds what libra mean for the crypto market facebook s token is poised to achieve two very important firsts for cryptocurrency the first crypto asset launched by a major tech company with a wide global rollout across both the financial world and consumer web services and the launch of the most high profile stablecoin ever created stablecoins are enticing but risky endeavors and in some cases fraught with controversy the idea behind a stablecoin is to reduce the volatility and uncertainty of crypto prices to ensure that conversions remittances and other transactions remain well stable for consumers there are a few ways to do this one is to peg a cryptocurrency either as a fiat currency or in facebook s case a basket of currencies such as in the case of tether the most high profile stablecoin until now which is in theory pegged 1 1 to the us dollar this turned out not to be entirely true and tether has dealt with a myriad of issues from allegations of price manipulation to a loss of trust and investigations into in whether the coin was fully backed and was used to cover popular exchange bitfinex s losses stablecoins can also be peggged to a reserve resource like gold or silver or in some cases it can be a coin where the supply demand and exchange rates are monitored and controlled to keep prices consistent stablecoins have gained popularity in countries like venezuela where citizens need an alternative to the hyperinflated bolivar but they can come in many different forms jpmorgan s jpm coin is a stablecoin in a fashion albeit only for use within the bank s own private blockchain network and ibm has partnered with blockchain payment network stellar to let international banks launch their own stablecoins on the stellar public blockchain the way facebook has structured libra gives the cryptocurrency instant global legitimacy both it the high profile members behind the effort and in tying the tokens to a number of government backed fiat currencies particularly through apps like whatsapp libra could also realize the promise of frictionless remittances and cross border payments in the developing world that gives unbanked users simple low fee ways to send and receive money libra is a huge market validation for crypto s long held promise of digital payments but the trade off is that the permissioned more centralized blockchain creates the transaction scalability needed while somewhat compromising the truly decentralized and distributed nature of the technology a lightning rod for regulation the moral is facebook s coin will work quite differently from bitcoin ethereum or any of the mainstream cryptocurrencies built on public blockchains libra won t be transacted over a public blockchain like bitcoin where it would be difficult for facebook to ensure the coin wasn t being used for illegal activities the private permissioned network set up through the libra association where only verified companies control nodes creates a network that s still decentralized to a degree but governed and monitored by a foundation that facebook and its partners control bloomberg reports that facebook will test its stablecoin first in india for whatsapp transfers with the goal of realizing one of cryptocurrency s ultimate goals seamless cross border payments and remittances anywhere in the world facebucks will shine a bright light on the cryptocurrency market as a whole and it ll also come with increased regulatory scrutiny from us agencies including the sec and ctfc as well as countries worldwide rolling out a global stablecoin of this kind that s pegged to multiple currencies and backed by giants of the tech and financial worlds will force the kind of accelerated regulatory action that the cryptocurrency market has been waiting for it ll also mean a lot more financial lobbying for facebook which is already dealing with multiple inquiries and regular calls for the social giant to be broken up in may members of the senate banking committee sent an open letter to zuckerberg inquiring into how facebook s cryptocurrency and payments system will work libra may ultimately be a net positive for cryptocurrency s legitimacy in financial markets and its fully realized potential for cross border payments but its most immediate impact may be the fallout of whatever regulations are enacted to police it the ripple effects of facebook s big pivot mark zuckerberg s messaging has changed significantly in the wake of facebook s tumultous stretch of privacy scandals security breaches and regulatory actions since the 2016 election after 15 years of making billions from online advertising as its core revenue stream zuck wants to change the core bargain at the heart of facebook and free online services writ large since the dawn of social networks the trade off has always been we give you a free service and you give us your personal data to target advertising at you most users didn t realize the implications and ramifications of this bargain until the cambridge analytica scandal and subsequent privacy revelations woke us up but that transaction is at the heart of how the modern internet works in march zuckerberg outlined plans to re engineer facebook and its entire app family from the ground up as a privacy focused platform in april at facebook s f8 developer conference zuck expanded on that foundational pivot by announcing that the company is overhauling the infrastructure behind facebook messenger instagram and whatsapp to make end to end encryption the default standard and promote private conversations where facebook collects less personal data on the one hand this broader unification fits with zuckerberg s vision to enmesh all of facebook s apps and make them more interoperable the founders of instagram and whatsapp have all left the company one after another reportedly amid increasing pressure from facebook to integrate their apps more deeply with the mothership on the other is this shift toward unified privacy two big dominoes fell in march when chris cox facebook s chief product officer and the de facto no 3 exec behind sheryl sandberg left the company along with him went chris daniels the recently installed head of whatsapp according to the new york times the zuckerberg led transition toward connecting the apps was the primary driver behind the departures facebook s revenue will always be built on targeted advertising but it s telling that at the same time zuckerberg announced the new privacy focused facebook he also touted a slew of new features around e commerce and shopping at f8 facebook announced that it s redesigning the marketplace with shipping support for sellers that instagram users will be able to buy products directly from influencers and that businesses will be able to upload product catalogs to whatsapp facebook already lets messenger users interact and shop directly with brands wouldn t it be easier for users if they could complete all these transactions with facebook s built in money the true value of a crypto coin for facebook is in convenience and engagement beyond any kind of altruistic notion of advancing an economic vision of digital money facebook is connecting all its apps and giving users a universal currency to use within them billion of users who already use these apps daily or monthly will have a built in mechanism to spend their money there too the implications of this shift could turn facebook from an online ad behemoth into a financial services and shopping giant to rival amazon and big banks especially because libra and calibra will be available to everyone beyond just the billions who use facebook owned apps if zuckerberg does see his vision of a private facebook become a reality the new connected continuum of facebook apps will have a self sustaining e commerce and shopping ecosystem built in to keep its billions of users sated within the walled garden and give billions more a new reason that facebook s technology is now indispensable in their daily lives editor s note this story was updated at noon

over a decade two weeks ago fed chair jerome powell set off a rally on wall street after he signaled that the central bank is willing to cut interest rates to help stabilize the economy if the trade war between washington and beijing starts to crimp growth any continued escalations could put the brakes on what is poised to be the longest economic expansion in u s history most analysts say they think economic growth has slowed sharply in the april june quarter to around a 1 5 percent annual rate only half the pace of the past year investors collectively envision a fed rate cut by july and possibly further cuts after that some are even betting on a rate cut this week many economists though think the fed will wait until september at the earliest to announce its first drop in its benchmark short term interest rate since 2008 and might not cut again in 2019 a few fed watchers foresee no rate cut at all this year i don t know that the fed is going to deliver what investors want

federal reserve officials are holding the second day of their two day june meeting wednesday under pressure from the u s president and financial markets to reverse at least some of last year s interest rate hikes most investors and economists expect that the fed will hold rates steady at the meeting but signal that they are likely to cut rates later this summer perhaps at their july meeting that signal could come in a change in language in the fed s statement and from the post meeting press conference with fed chair jerome powell market measures of expected interest rates which are not always accurate suggest interest rate traders expect the fed to cut rates three times this year president donald trump on tuesday once again seemed to be criticizing the fed in a series of tweets about the european central bank s signal that it would deploy stimulus the summer if the pace of economic growth did not pick up the euro weakened against the dollar which could make european exports more attractive globally and european stocks indexes rallied i just want a level playing field trump said to reporters the fed hiked interest rates four times last year most recently in december early last year the official forecasts of fed officials showed they expected to raise rates at least three times this year continuing its policy of gradually raising its interest rate target the fed has also been shrinking its balance sheet by letting some of its bond holdings run off as the bonds mature trump began openly criticizing the fed last summer arguing that the hikes were hampering his efforts to accelerate economic growth while fed officials never responded directly to trump s complaints in their official statements they argued that their hikes were not intended to stymie growth they claimed that their policy was aimed at extending the now record long economic expansion while bringing interest rates closer to historical norms after several years of ultra low rates that followed the financial crisis and great recession financial markets panicked in the last three months of 2018 culminating in a crescendo of selling in december of 2018 while some investors blamed both heightened trade tensions for the sell off a december agreement between the u s and china to restart trade negotiations and hold off on further tariff escalation did little to bolster the market many investors feared the fed was signaling that monetary policy was on auto pilot and rates were headed up despite some signs of economic weakness this raised the prospect that the fed could mistakenly push the u s into a recession the fed changed its policy in january instead of gradually raising rates the fed announced it would now be patient still though official fed forecasts implied that they would hike rates at least one more time in 2019 this shift placated investors and stocks rallied economic growth came in at better than expected showing the economy grew at a better than three percent rate in the first three months of the year trump however continued to criticize the fed his two picks to fill seats on the fed board businessman herman caine and conservative economic pundit stephen moore were forced to withdraw themselves from consideration after it became apparent that senate republicans could not muster enough votes to confirm them at the heart of trump s dispute with the fed is a disagreement about the potential of the u s economy the fed foresees the economy growing about 2 percent this year and thinks the long term growth path is slightly below 2 percent growth above that level is seen as the economy performing above potential and as risking an acceleration of inflation in most of the economic models deployed by the fed the very low level of unemployment recorded last year and this year would indicate that interest rates should be rising to stave off possible overheating and inflation trump and his closest economic advisers think the potential growth of the economy is much higher they are aiming for 3 percent growth this year and think the economy could grow as much as four percent trump s tax cuts and push to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses were aimed at encouraging investment raising productivity and pushing economic growth higher inflation has remained surprisingly low defying predictions that a tight labor market would push up price levels most recently the personal consumption expenditure index the fed s favorite inflation gauge came in at 1 5 percent well below the 2 percent fed target inflation has consistently undershot the fed s target for years prompting some to speculate that the fed s target of 2 percent is in effect a ceiling rather than a target fed officials insist that the target is symmetrical meaning deviations below the target are as undesirable as deviations above the target this however may make the fed s failure to hit its target more problematic it implies that the fed either lacks the policy tools to hit the target or has incompetently deployed its tools another alternative explanation is that inflation is just taking longer to reach the target than expected at least some fed watchers have said that the fed has acted as if it were actually targeting a lower level of inflation than it claims to be consistently undershooting the inflation target poses the risk that the public s expectation for prices could move lower to match recent experience in the view of most fed officials inflation expectations are an important cause of actual expectations if inflation expectations become anchored at too low of a level it becomes harder to move inflation to the fed s target the university of michigan s recent survey of consumer sentiment showed that inflation expectations fell in june to their lowest level in at least forty years trade policy has been another source of uncertainty and surprise over the past year the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum in the spring of 2018 saying tariffs were necessary to protect industries vital to national security from price levels for the metals depressed by chinese overproduction many business leaders and economists predicted that higher metals prices would push up consumer prices as producers passed on the costs of the tariffs that did not happen prices of metals rose but were largely absorbed in the chain of production indicating that businesses have not been able to pass on the costs and have instead allowed profit margins to contract prices on store shelves or car showrooms fell or remained in line with the low level of inflation seen in the rest of the economy it may be that the trump tax cuts which have boosted after tax returns for businesses created more room for tariffs to be absorbed by businesses the china tariffs have followed a very similar path when trump began to impose tariffs on china last summer starting with a 25 percent tariff on a basket of mostly high tech goods used by u s businesses critics said they would raise consumer prices those claims became more amplified when the trump administration imposed a 10 percent tariff on 200 billion of chinese goods but higher prices did not follow the tariffs on china have instead been absorbed by a combination of u s importers accepting lower margins china s currency falling in value against the dollar chinese producers lowering prices and u s companies shifting production to other low cost countries not subject to the tariffs some critics continue to say that the tariffs will eventually raise prices although these claims have lost much of the credibility after several months of tariffs the failure of a tight labor market and tariffs to raise prices may have caught fed policymakers by surprise suggesting that at least the last hike was made based on inaccurate forecasts more recently the u s economy has shown some signs of sluggishness consumer sentiment has fallen from all time highs although it remains at an elevated level job creation in february and may was low by recent standards and lower than most economists had forecast although still high enough to keep the unemployment level at or near its 50 year low growth in the manufacturing sector which is just 12 percent of the economy but often serves as a bellwether for approaching economic contractions has slowed and some regional surveys even suggest activity has contracted critics of the trump administration have been quick to point to the tariffs as a drag on the economy the brief threat of tariffs on mexican goods may have created a heightened level of anxiety given the complex and deep ties that have developed between the u s and mexican economies over the last three decades but it is far more likely that sluggish economic growth in europe and elsewhere around the globe has depressed demand for u s goods and services than that tariffs are playing much of a role the fed is likely to respond somewhat elliptically to recent economic data many fed watchers think they will drop the word patient from their official statement indicating that they will act quickly to keep the economic expansion going the very word that once reassured markets is now seen as stale and many fear a patient fed would cut rates too late the fed could also add language to their statement indicating that they stand ready to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion a phrase chairman powell used in remarks earlier this month if the fed does not make at least some of the expected changes to its statement or if powell conveys a message of hesitancy on rates financial markets are likely to react by selling off risk assets and bidding up u s treasuries pushing yields down fed officials are all too aware that each word of the statement will be closely parsed and weighed by investors the fed could also cut its interest rate target there seems little to gain by holding off until july especially if the fed is basically sending a message that a cut is coming soon markets are not quite prepared for a june cut but it would not come entirely as a shock the futures market suggests that there is about a 20 percent chance of a cut this month and indeed surprising the market with an aggressive move would lead little doubt about the fed s ability and willingness to act

traders june 19 2019 trade protectionism and us manufacturing employment chunding li jing wang john whalley nber working paper may 2019 abstract this paper uses a numerical global general equilibrium model to simulate the possible effects of us initiated trade protection measures on us manufacturing employment the simulation results show that us trade protection measures do not increase but will instead reduce manufacturing employment and us losses will further increase if trade partners take retaliatory measures the mechanism is that although the substitution effects between domestic and foreign goods have positive impacts the substitution effects between manufacturing and service sectors and the retaliatory effects both have negative influences therefore the whole effect is that the us will lose manufacturing employment is an army of robots marching on chinese jobs osea giuntella tianyi wang university of pittsburgh working paper april 2019 abstract a handful of studies have investigated the effects of robots on workers in advanced economies according to a recent report from the world bank 2016 1 8 billion jobs in developing countries are susceptible to automation given the inability of labor markets to adjust to rapid changes there is a growing concern that the effect of automation and robotization in emerging economies may increase inequality and social unrest yet we still know very little about the impact of robots in developing countries in this paper we analyze the effects of exposure to industrial robots in the chinese labor market using aggregate data from chinese prefectural cities 2000 2016 and individual longitudinal data from china we find a large negative impact of robot exposure on employment and wages of chinese workers effects are concentrated in the state owned sector and are larger among low skilled male and prime age and older workers furthermore we find evidence that exposure to robots affected internal mobility and increased the number of labor related strikes and protests disentangling global value chains alonso de gortari nber working paper may 2019 abstract the patterns of production underlying the recent rise of global value chains gvcs have become increasingly complex nafta supply chains for example are now deeply integrated using mexican customs data i find that exports to the u s use a much higher share of american inputs than exports to other countries however the conventional framework used to measure gvcs ignores this heterogeneity since it assumes that all output uses the same input mix i develop a new framework that combines input output data with additional information on supply chain linkages in order to construct gvcs reflecting the use of inputs observed in the latter improving measurement matters quantitatively since it affects both value added trade measures and counterfactual experiments i show that incorporating mexican customs data raises the estimated share of u s value in u s imported mexican manufactures from 18 to 30 and amplifies the welfare cost of a nafta trade war u s presidential cycles and the foreign exchange market samar ashour david rakowski salil sarkar review of financial economics forthcoming abstract we examine the association between the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar and us presidential cycles results show that republican presidencies tend to start with a strong dollar which then depreciates over the course of the presidency in contrast democratic presidencies tend to begin with a weak dollar that then appreciates these patterns result in an apparent presidential effect in us foreign exchange rates the direction of which depends on whether exchange rates are measured by levels or by returns quitting globalization trade related job losses nationalism and resistance to fdi in the united states yilang feng andrew kerner jane sumner political science research and methods forthcoming abstract existing research has found that american politicians benefit from trying to attract investment and creates jobs in this paper we build on this work by describing the drivers of americans attitudes toward inward foreign investment fdi we posit that foreign and chinese investment are different than domestic investment in the public imagination and that nationalism and proximity to deindustrialization interact to shape public opinion about them we propose and test two theories of this interaction using a survey experiment that randomizes whether a respondent is responding to a statement about business investment foreign business investment or chinese business investment we find that 1 americans are skeptical of business investments by chinese and to lesser degree foreign firms 2 the gap in enthusiasm for generic business investment and foreign chinese business investment rises with local trade related job losses and 3 the distinction between nationalists and non nationalists attitudes toward fdi declines in local job losses trade and worker deskilling rui costa swati dhingra stephen machin nber working paper june 2019 abstract this paper presents new evidence on international trade and worker outcomes it examines a big world event that produced an unprecedentedly large shock to the uk exchange rate in the 24 hours in june 2016 during which the uk electorate unexpectedly voted to leave the european union the value of sterling plummeted it recorded the biggest depreciation that has occurred in any of the world s four major currencies since the collapse of bretton woods exploiting this variation the paper studies the impact of trade on wages and worker training wages and training fell for workers employed in sectors where the intermediate import price rose by more as a consequence of the sterling depreciation calibrating the estimated wage elasticity with respect to intermediate import prices to theory uncovers evidence of a production complementarity between workers and intermediate imports this provides new direct evidence that in the modern world of global value chains it is changes in the cost of intermediate imports that act as a driver of the impact of globalization on worker welfare the episode studied and the findings add to widely expressed growing concerns about poor productivity performance relating to skills and to patterns of real wage stagnation that are plaguing contemporary labour markets trade blocs and trade wars during the interwar period david jacks dennis novy nber working paper may 2019 abstract what precisely were the causes and consequences of the trade wars in the 1930s were there perhaps deeper forces at work in reorienting global trade prior to the outbreak of world war ii and what lessons may this particular historical episode provide for the present day to answer these questions we distinguish between long run secular trends in the period from 1920 to 1939 related to the formation of trade blocs in particular the british commonwealth and short run disruptions associated with the trade wars of the 1930s in particular large and widespread declines in bilateral trade the narrowing of trade imbalances and sharp drops in average traded distances we argue that the trade wars mainly served to intensify pre existing efforts towards the formation of trade blocs which dated from at least 1920 more speculatively we argue that the trade wars of the present day may serve a similar purpose as those in the 1930s that is the intensification of china and us centric trade blocs foreign financing and the international sources of property rights timm betz amy pond world politics july 2019 pages 503 541 abstract how do firms protect themselves against infringements of their property rights by their own government the authors develop a theory based on international law and joint asset ownership with foreign firms investment agreements protect the assets of foreign firms but are not available to domestic firms this segmentation of the property rights environment creates a rationale for international financial relationships between firms by forming financial relationships with foreign firms domestic firms gain indirect coverage from the property rights available to foreign firms under investment agreements if a government is less likely to violate the property rights of covered foreign firms it is also less likely to violate property rights for assets held jointly by domestic and foreign firms this article presents systematic evidence from data on the activities of firms in countries that have investment agreements with the united states international financial relationships between firms through mergers and acquisitions as well as through bond and equity issues are more common where property rights are weak the theory suggests a political logic to the fragmentation of firm ownership stakes across jurisdictions offers an institutional explanation of international financial flows and identifies new distributional consequences of international law international business travel and technology sourcing nune hovhannisyan wolfgang keller nber working paper may 2019 abstract access to new foreign technology is often central to countries development strategies however we know very little about the quantitative impact of technology sourcing in this paper we study the role of outward international business travel for technology sourcing and innovation by examining whether patenting in european regions is affected by the number of business travelers heading to the united states using european regional patent data for the years 1996 to 2010 from eurostat and information on incoming business travelers from the u s department of commerce s survey of international air travelers we find that controlling for a region s r d spending and size innovation is increasing in the number of business travelers of the region to the united states technology sourcing through in person business travel is not only statistically but economically significant accounting for example for 20 of the higher patenting in germany s greater stuttgart area compared to portugal s algarve region tracing the legacy china s historical aid and contemporary investment in africa pippa morgan yu zheng international studies quarterly forthcoming abstract in this article we depart from the classic model of foreign direct investment fdi determinants and examine the effect of sociohistorical factors on fdi we argue that past foreign aid projects confer social capital that constitutes specific resources available to investors in the present increasing their preferences for host countries in which their home country has accumulated more social capital we use new data on china s historical aid in africa to test these contentions uncovering a positive significant connection between china s historical aid program in africa 1956 1999 and contemporary 2000 2015 investments by chinese companies while china s historical aid may have been politically driven it has had important long term consequences for its commercial investors more broadly these findings suggest a sociohistorical explanation of the puzzle of why chinese foreign investments deviate from conventional fdi patterns evidence for the effect of monitoring costs on foreign direct investment bruce blonigen anca cristea donghyun lee nber working paper june 2019 abstract a proposed reason for the significant inverse relationship between distance both physical and cultural and foreign direct investment is the increased costs for a parent firm to monitor an affiliate when there is greater distance between them we provide the first direct test of this hypothesis using o net data on occupational skills to construct industry level measures of the importance of monitoring related skills we then exploit this cross industry variation to examine whether physical and cultural distances have a greater impact on cross border m a in industries where monitoring related skills are more important using data on worldwide cross border m a activity from 1985 through 2014 we find significant evidence for the effect of monitoring costs on cross border m a activity we also show that the relatively low importance of monitoring related costs in manufacturing industries compared to those in other sectors is an important factor in explaining why cross border m a in manufacturing is so large despite its relatively small share of the modern economy

president donald trump has already given the global economy trade wars now there are signs he may be gearing up for a currency war too with a series of tweets on tuesday aimed at the european central bank and an announcement by mario draghi its president that he was prepared to cut interest rates further below zero in response to europe s slowing growth trump made a rare american presidential intervention into another economy s monetary policy mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others he tweeted later he added german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states it was not the first time trump has blamed currency manipulation overseas for a strong dollar that raises the cost of u s exports he has already become unique among recent american presidents in a shift away from the strong dollar policy of his predecessors by targeting draghi directly and responding in real time to an overseas central bankers policy pronouncement trump was dialing up the heat just as his own federal reserve was gathering in washington to decide on rates in a decision expected wednesday coming just days ahead of a summit with other group of 20 leaders in japan the salvo served to highlight his administration s increasingly aggressive currency policies and the place he sees for them in his trade arsenal they are preparing the ground they are laying out the potential tools they may have at their disposal said cesar rojas global economist at citigroup global markets inc though he added we re not at a currency war just yet german dax way up due to stimulus remarks from mario draghi very unfair to the united states donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 18 2019 finance ministers and central bankers this month agreed that a currency war a tit for tat push at times of slow economic growth to actively weaken foreign exchange rates in order to boost exports is in no one s interest they reaffirmed commitments made in march 2018 to refrain from competitive devaluations last month the u s treasury increased the number of economies it scrutinizes to 21 from 12 and expanded its watch list from four to nine adding countries such as ireland italy and singapore under new tougher criteria it again refrained from labeling china a manipulator the commerce department on may 23 proposed allowing u s companies to seek trade sanctions against goods from countries with undervalued currencies though it said it did not intend to target independent central banks or their monetary policy decisions the administration has also been pushing to include currency provisions carrying the threat of sanctions in new u s trade agreements there are plenty of economists who argue the u s should take a more forceful approach to addressing currency manipulation by trading partners some have even called for a 21st century plaza accord the 1980s agreement that saw countries including japan agree to engineer a devaluation of the dollar under pressure from the reagan administration top priority in a paper released this week brad setser a former u s treasury official now at the council on foreign relations argued that countering currency intervention by foreign governments should be a top priority of u s international economic policy if nothing else other countries manipulation hurts the u s s ability to use exports to recover following economic downturns he wrote in an interview on tuesday however setser said that trump s ecb intervention was misplaced largely because draghi s comments were aimed at domestic conditions most of the world recognizes that the ecb has failed to meet its inflation target and that with a slowing european economy there is pressure on the ecb to ease policy he said worse trump s intervention could be seen as its own form of market manipulation setser said and feeds into a building narrative in europe that the u s is a rogue actor under a rogue president trump has defied convention in a number of other ways including his repeated criticisms of federal reserve chairman jerome powell for raising interest rates he asked white house lawyers earlier this year to explore his options for removing powell as chairman joseph gagnon a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and another advocate of stronger u s currency policy said the world was in an uneasy peace over currencies with china and other g 20 countries having in recent years accepted a u s push to refrain from competitive devaluations in a june 6 note gagnon and a co author said interventions by countries to weaken their currencies to affect their trade balance fell in 2018 to the lowest level since 2001 but the g 20 commitments are weak and if there s a global downturn a global recession countries would be very tempted to violate these terms and try to claim special circumstances he said there s really no regime in place to sanction them or hit them except the u s might do something trump may have some legitimate reasons to grumble the big mac approach to gauging currency valuations shows the euro is about 15 too cheap since trump launched his trade wars china s yuan has also fallen against the dollar prompting the president to complain that it was undermining the impact of his tariffs and his efforts to raise pressure on beijing those currency moves are widely seen as related to the weakening of the european and chinese economies and a global economy that is looking increasingly fragile thanks in part to trump s trade wars the fear however is that trump s anger over the currency shifts could also help fuel further trade actions including tariffs he has threatened to impose on imported cars and parts from the eu but put on hold for 180 days a drop below 1 10 for the euro dollar rate could inflame trump s temper and make him more likely to impose those auto tariffs according to jens nordvig the founder of exante data llc the rate fell as low as 1 1181 on tuesday after draghi said additional stimulus may be needed and trump levied his latest twitter missive

securities on the fed statement few expected the fed to cut rates today but there was a remarkable shift in the number of members who expect the next move in interest rates will be down and the most dovish member bullard dissented on the decision believing the fed should have cut rates at this meeting the majority of members expect to cut rates 25 basis points next year with the median dot for 2020 50 basis points lower than its march level we have recently shifted our own forecast in favour of fed rate cuts given increased uncertainty in the global economic outlook thanks largely to tensions on the trade front today s projections make clear that the fed is not too far away from our own view and has committed to act is need be oxford economics on the fed as expected the fomc kept

point rate cut as soon as july advertisement oxford also said the dot plot estimates were more dovish than we expected the median interest rate forecast for 2019 barely remained at 2 38 as it was just one vote away from declining seven out of the 17 fed officials are looking for two 25 basis point rate cuts this year while one sees a 25 basis point rate cut eight officials look for rates to be on hold while one looks for a rate hike for 2020 the median estimate calls for a 25 basis point rate cut to 2 13 mid point of fed funds range followed by a 25 basis point rate hike in 2021 rbc capital markets on the fed clearly there is a low hurdle for the fed to ease but even with a low hurdle there still needs to be justification as powell said if developments over the inter meeting period lack of progress on trade is clearly high on the list suggest they should cut they will but we think the opposite is also true that the events of coming weeks are likely to dictate whether they cut or not makes the current make up of the dots interesting there are two factions right now and they are pretty close to evenly split about half are looking for 50bps of cuts in 2019 but about half are also looking for no cuts it is much easier for members to consolidate into one of these camps than it would be for the fed to come in today with broad consensus for a cut in 2019 and then to have to back off of that if trade developments improved this distribution gives them credibility cover it also suggests the fed either stands pat for the balance of the year again contingent on how big the tail risk from trade is or they cut 50 basis points but nothing in between on this it is worth noting that powell was receptive to the idea that when rates are so low and in the effective lower bound era it makes more sense to cut harder sooner so that there is a relatively high market probability of about 1 3 that we get a 50bps cut in july seems about right but this should also get a significant

major wall street economists believe the federal reserve will not cut rates on wednesday but will signal a readiness to act in the future the central bank will issue its much anticipated interest rate decision on wednesday afternoon they are under pressure to pretty much signal a rate cut is coming if they don t do it on wednesday traders have priced in a 20 chance of a rate cut in june and about 80 probability of another reduction in july according to the cme fedwatch tool but some of the economists believe the fed may fall short of sending a clear signal that rate cuts are on the way they say the fed will remove any hikes from its forecast of future rate moves the so called dot plot but not explicitly show a cut is on the horizon we expect the committee will prefer to keep its options open stated a note from goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius in our view not enough has changed to warrant a clear signal of an upcoming cut barclays sees the fed dropping the word patience from its statement and instead adding flexibility here s what the major banks expect at wednesday s fomc meeting
spread the love tokyo ap global markets were mixed wednesday amid some optimism about u s china trade talks and ahead of an interest rate decision by the u s federal reserve the fed isn t considered ready to announce its first rate cut in more than a decade but many expect the central bank to signal an inclination to ease credit sometime within the next several months its meeting comes a day after the head of the european central bank said it was ready to cut interest rates and provide additional economic stimulus if necessary france s cac 40 was stable at 5 513 while germany s dax was flat at 12 331 britain s ftse 100 fell about 0 3 to 7 423 after a report showed that inflation in britain dipped in may likely easing the pressure on the bank of england to raise interest rates this summer u s shares were set for a mixed open with dow futures up less than 0 1 at 26 509 s p 500 futures ticked down less than 0 1 to 2 925 two weeks ago fed chair jerome powell set off a rally on wall street after he signaled that the central bank is willing to cut interest rates to help stabilize the economy if the trade war between washington and beijing starts to crimp growth any continued escalations could put the brakes on what is poised to be the longest economic expansion in u s history investors collectively envision a fed rate cut by july and possibly further cuts after that some even expect a rate cut this week many economists though think the fed will wait until september at the earliest to announce its first drop in its benchmark short term interest rate since 2008 and might not cut again in 2019 i think the fed is going to send the markets a clear signal that they are ready to lower rates in the very near future said brian bethune an economics lecturer at tufts university earlier asian markets rose after u s president donald trump said he will hold talks with chinese president xi jinping at an international summit in japan u s businesses have implored trump to stop escalating the trade war and refrain from expanding his tariffs to 300 billion on goods from china analysts acknowledged an immediate resolution to the trade conflict isn t expected but the confirmation that trump and xi plan to talk at the g 20 in osaka was cause for some optimism while warning that risks remain while this certainly is a near term boost for markets the question as to what can be resolved by the two leaders meeting that had not been done so despite months of discussions keeps this as a risk factor said jingyi pan market strategist at ig in singapore japan s benchmark nikkei 225 added 1 7 to finish at 21 333 87 australia s s p asx 200 rose 1 2 to 6 648 10 south korea s kospi was also up 1 2 at 2 124 78 hong kong s hang seng gained 2 6 to 28 202 14 while the shanghai composite added nearly 1 0 to 2 917 80 energy benchmark crude oil edged down 1 cent to 53 89 a barrel it rose 3 8 to 53 90 a barrel tuesday brent crude oil the international standard lost 42 cents to 61 72 a barrel currencies the dollar inched down to 108 39 yen from 108 48 yen on tuesday the euro rose slightly to 1 1207 from 1 1191 share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading

the federal reserve held interest rates steady but shifted towards a more dovish stance and pointed to possible interest rate cuts in the future citing rising uncertainties about the economic outlook at the end of a two day meeting marked by concerns about slowing growth and rising trade tensions the fed said it would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion and would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook this marked a change compared with previous language in which the fed said it would simply be patient in determining changes to interest rate policy the fed also downgraded its description of the health of the us economy saying activity was rising at a moderate rate a less rosy picture than the solid rate of expansion it saw in may and noted that inflation continued to run below its 2 per cent target yet even as the fed set the stage for possible monetary stimulus economic projections released by the us central bank along with its statement suggested that interest rate cuts could take time to happen and may not occur before next year read more the median interest rate forecast of fed officials showed no change for the rest of 2019 but a 25 basis point reduction next year compared with their previous projection of a 25 basis point increase in 2020 copyright the financial times limited 2019
washington ap stock markets are subdued today as investors look ahead to the u s federal reserve s policy meeting in which the central bank is expected to indicate it could cut interest rates in coming months futures for the dow and s p 500 are down about 0 1 percent this morning as is germany s dax stock index the dollar is stable against the yen at 108 43 yen and against the euro at 1 1200 the fed isn t considered ready to announce that it s reducing rates for the first time in more than a decade but when it ends its latest policy meeting today the central bank is expected to signal an inclination to ease credit sometime within the next several months what it won t likely do is indicate when that might happen i think the fed is going to send the markets a clear signal that they are ready to lower rates in the very near future said brian bethune an economics lecturer at tufts university bethune said he thinks the first rate cut will occur when the fed next meets at the end of july and then a second one at its subsequent meeting in mid september i will be looking for two rate cuts to have an impact bethune said other fed watchers have said they aren t sure rates will be cut anytime soon many think the policymakers want at least to see whether a meeting that presidents donald trump and xi jinping are to hold at the end of the month produces any breakthrough in the u s china trade war the fed will announce its decisions about 2 p m today in a policy statement after its meeting followed by a news conference with chairman jerome powell the central bank will also update its forecasts for economic growth employment inflation and interest rates if investors are hoping for clarity about the fed s policy plans for the coming months they re likely to be disappointed some analysts think powell will merely echo the theme he struck in a speech earlier this month that the fed will act if it thinks the trump administration s trade conflicts are threatening the economic expansion that comment signaled a shift from holding rates steady to at least the hint of rate cuts and it ignited a stock market rally economists say when or even whether the fed eases credit this year will depend on a host of factors that are hard to predict will trump s trade wars be resolved before they inflict real damage on the economy will the job market remain resilient even as growth slows will inflation finally edge close to the fed s target level many analysts think the fed will wait until september at the earliest to announce its first drop in its benchmark short term rate since 2008 and might not cut again in 2019 a few fed watchers foresee no rate cut at all this year especially if the united states and china reach some tentative resolution to the trade war complicating the timing of possible rate cuts is an escalation of public attacks on the fed by trump as he gears up for his 2020 re election campaign trump s public criticism a highly unusual action for a president has raised concern that he is undermining the fed s independence as a central bank the president has asserted that under powell s leadership the fed hurt the economy by tightening credit too much last year and by failing to lower rates since then on tuesday trump was asked about a news report that the white house in february had explored whether the president had the authority to demote powell as chairman while leaving him on the fed s board let s see what he does trump said tuesday of powell they re going to be making an announcement very soon so we ll see what happens

reconciliations of certain non gaap measures with that i will now turn the call over to kurt darrow la z boy s chairman president and chief executive officer kurt kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer thank you kathy good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning last evening we released our fiscal year 2019 and fourth quarter results in line with our pre announcement that we released on june 5th fiscal 19 was an exciting and productive year for la z boy incorporated we delivered excellent retail performance nearly doubling our operating income acquired the arizona based la z boy furniture galleries stores the highest performing operation in the la z boy store network solidified our position in the e commerce space with our acquisition of joybird a premier direct to consumer retailer and manufacturer of upholstered furniture further strengthened our well established manufacturing platform and set the stage for ongoing long term growth we closed fiscal 2019 achieving a 10 increase in sales to 1 75 billion reflecting improvement across all core reporting segments and posted a 7 4 consolidated operating margin representing a strong performance within the home furnishings industry the la z boy furniture gallery network performed well and the company owned stores in our retail segment posted a delivered same store sales increase of 5 7 for the full fiscal year we generated 151 million in cash from operating activities and returned a combined total of 46 million to shareholders through an increased dividend and share purchases and with a strong financial position we are able to make strategic investments to drive growth across the enterprise fuel new ventures to tap into new markets and weather macroeconomic changes now let s turn the discussion over to the fourth quarter consolidated sales for the quarter increased 8 driven by excellent results for our company owned retail segment including both organic growth and acquisitions including the north dartmouth store in massachusetts and nine arizona stores joybird also fueled our sales performance however as indicated in the early june announcement sales declined in the wholesale upholstery and casegoods segments in the fourth quarter consistent with a slow start to the calendar year across the north america retail home furnishings landscape and with the lower volume translating to a direct impact to earnings given our fixed cost structure as noted in our pre release challenges in the canadian market had a disproportionate impact to our sales for the quarter now onto the wholesale business in our upholstery segment while the full year showed positive growth sales for the fourth quarter declined 1 2 versus last year s quarter consistent with the declines we have seen across the industry while our us la z boy wholesale business was up slightly we saw weakness in canada as well as with other international and non branded businesses gaap accounting for the quarter was 11 5 and non gaap operating margin was 11 6 versus 12 8 in the prior year with the declines versus the prior year s quarter reflecting a change in product mix to more power products and our duo line as well as the fixed cost impact from a decrease in units but all in all we delivered a strong margin for the quarter up sequentially from the third quarter even on lower sales in the casegoods segment which also grew sales for the year q4 sales decreased 12 9 versus the prior year consistent with industry trends at 9 1 we essentially held operating margin down volume versus last year s quarter highlighting our agile supply chain our casegood team continues to increase its presence on retail floors positioning us to capture future opportunities with respect to our brand platform we are investing in the strong brand equity of la z boy to further solidify our standing in the marketplace as you know in may we introduced kristen bell as our new brand ambassador and relaunched the live life comfortably campaign across multiple channels including tv digital print la z boy social and web platforms and through the la z boy furniture galleries stores we are up spending on the brand platform in the first quarter along with our independent la z boy furniture gallery dealers who are contributing to this investment we are delighted with the initial consumer response with kristen bringing in new energy to la z boy with her vibrant personality warmth style quick wit and a focus on home and the family with a robust social media following particularly among younger consumers kristen is already bringing a new eyes to the brand as she highlights the wide variety of comfortable stylish and quality products and services offered by la z boy on the product and innovation side at the april high point market we introduced a wireless hand remote option for our power and motion furniture the remote includes two memory positions a home button a usb port and a lockout feature it was very well received by our dealers and is representative of the fantastic work being done by the r d team at our dayton tennessee innovation center additionally as consumers demonstrate increasing interest in concern for the environment we introduced an eco friendly collection of fabrics called conserve these fabrics contain at least 30 recycled plastic bottles that are spun into yarn and on average each sofa made with the conserve fabric utilizes approximately 110 recycled plastic bottles we also expanded our urban attitude and duo lines both of which remain popular with consumers now moving on to our retail segment our company owned retail segment turned in an excellent fourth quarter with our team continued to execute at a high level sales increased 25 excuse me sales increased 24 9 delivered same store sales increased 8 and operating income increased significantly on a gaap basis operating margin improved to 8 4 from 6 6 and non gaap operating margin increased to 8 5 from 6 6 excluding result from acquisitions the core la z boy retail business delivered healthy increases in sales and operating margin delivered by a higher ticket and increased design sales performance for the period was also driven by 22 million in sales from the 10 stores acquired nine of which are in arizona as noted previously the arizona stores have higher volume experienced a higher operating margin and have a lower sg a as a percent of sales than the average across our remaining retail portfolio now across the complete la z boy furniture galleries network written same store sales for the 353 stores was positive at 0 8 for the quarter and up 1 8 for the full fiscal year excluding canada where business was challenged by weakening exchange rates and tariffs on finished goods coming from the us written same store sales across the 318 us network stores increased 2 5 for the fourth quarter and 3 2 for the full 2019 year on a positive note the canadian tariff on finished goods was lifted in may and our canadian la z boy furniture gallery stores experienced their first written same store sales increase in eight months and to provide some up to date color we are pleased with the performance throughout the network over the memorial day weekend we are continuing to invest in our la z boy furniture galleries store system as that is where we re having the best opportunity to showcase the full array of our product offerings while providing the consumer with an excellent shopping experience the stores also afford us the opportunity to sell full room groups design services which expand the average ticket across the network for fiscal 2019 we executed 19 projects including new stores remodels and relocations and for fiscal 2020 we have more than 20 projects on tap and expect to end the year with 358 stores including five net new stores now let s turn to joybird the e commerce business we acquired last august just five years old joybird continues to exhibit rapid top line growth that is providing la z boy with new consumers through a new channel for the quarter joybird delivered 22 million in sales on the bottom line we are making progress and driving to be slightly profitable in the back half of fiscal 2020 excluding purchase accounting adjustments leveraging our supply chain expertise has already unlocked pre acquisition capability constraints at joybird tijuana facility almost doubling it additionally we are now making and delivering several of joybird s best selling sofas at our dayton tennessee plant to take advantage of our nationwide distribution capabilities to shortened delivery times and lower costs while it s too early to determine how large joybird will become it is our fastest growing business today on pace to deliver more than 75 million in revenue in our first nine months of ownership we have every confidence in its ability to become one of the leading online destinations for unique and beautifully crafted mid century modern furniture and to deliver long term value to the company now before turning the call over to melinda i will take a few minutes to address the recent changes to tariffs as we mentioned early the 10 retaliatory tariff on finished goods going into canada was lifted on may 19th good and encouraging news however we are still up against currency trends that are making goods coming from the us more expensive in canada so it may take some time before we see that business completely regain its strong momentum also in may the 10 tariff on goods coming from china increased 25 this continues to impact several items we source from our manufacturing operations however most of our cover for our including most of our cover for our upholstery product as a reminder however for la z boy two thirds of our cover is converted into cut and sew kits in our mexican based facility and is therefore not subject to the chinese tariff leaving just one third of kits subject to the tariff we continue to be subject to the full 25 tariff on actuators a component part used in our power product now recall at 10 we were passing through the combined tariffs as a surcharge on our wholesale business then increased our price roughly 2 on the la z boy s upholstery business and about 3 on upholstered units with power with the supply chain working diligently with our global partners to minimize the impact of tariffs the increased tariffs at 25 translated a pass through surcharge as of june 1st of about 3 5 on non powered upholstery and about 4 on power products since raising our prices in response to the initial round of chinese tariffs we have not seen a significant change in buying patterns but at this point it s too early to tell what will be the impact to demand elasticity from the recent increase to 25 but with that said we continue to believe we are more competitively positioned than many in the furniture industry based on our us upholstery manufacturing footprint and the sourcing capabilities of our global supply chain i will now turn over the call to melinda to review our financial performance melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks kurt and good morning everyone to start let me remind you that we are presenting our results on both a gaap and non gaap basis which excludes purchase accounting adjustments for our acquisitions and the non cash charge for the fourth quarter termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan we believe this non gaap presentation better reflects underlying trends in performance of the business throughout fiscal 2019 we recorded 7 5 million or 0 12 per share in purchase accounting charges the majority of which related to the acquisition of joybird which is reflected in corporate and other and the 10 la z boy s furniture galleries stores which are reflected in our retail segment for consistency we have presented prior periods similarly for the impact of prior acquisitions the termination of the pension plan resulted in a one time non cash charge of 32 7 million or 0 58 per diluted share and as always a full reconciliation of gaap to non gaap is included in our press release the tables are also included in the appendix section at the end of our conference call slides and now i ll briefly review our consolidated fourth quarter results before moving to a discussion of the full year as kurt noted sales increased 8 versus the prior year quarter to 454 million reflecting strong growth in retail and joybird but challenges to our wholesale businesses consistent with the industry gaap consolidated operating income was 37 million for the quarter and excluding purchase accounting charges non gaap consolidated operating income was 39 million versus 46 million in last year s quarter consolidated operating margin on a gaap basis was 8 2 versus 10 9 last year and non gaap consolidated operating margin was 8 6 versus 10 9 last year given our fixed cost structure volume declines experienced by our wholesale business translated to a negative margin impact on these businesses in addition as discussed last quarter changes to our consolidated business mix with the acquisition of joybird and the growth of our retail segment impacted quarter over quarter comparisons this created an expected 120 basis point drag to operating margin the combination of 310 basis points higher sg a partially offset by an improvement in gross margin from this mix in addition incentives increased incentive compensation costs were 170 basis points higher than prior year and changes in employee benefits policies increased cost 40 basis points during the q4 transition period gaap earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2019 fourth quarter were 0 03 versus 0 72 in the prior year period non gaap eps was 0 64 per diluted share in the current quarter versus 0 72 in last year s fourth quarter non gaap results exclude a 0 03 per share charge for purchase accounting as well as the non cash charge of 0 58 per share for the termination of the defined benefit pension plan also affecting comparability the fourth quarter includes the increased incentive comp cost of 0 13 a 0 03 per share charge for changes in employee benefits as well and conversely last year s fourth quarter included a 0 06 per share benefit related to tax reform turning to a discussion of our fiscal 2019 full year results sales increased 10 or 161 million to 1 75 billion driven both by growth in our core businesses and from recent acquisitions consolidated operating income on a gaap basis increased to 131 million and on a non gaap basis to 137 million gaap consolidated operating margin declined to 7 4 from 8 2 last year and this year s non gaap operating margin was 7 8 compared to 8 2 gaap earnings per share were 1 44 versus 1 67 in prior year non gaap eps for this fiscal year was 2 14 versus 1 68 in the prior fiscal again this year s non gaap results exclude the non cash pension termination charge of 0 58 and the charge for purchase accounting of 0 12 on the year fiscal 2018 non gaap results exclude a similar charge for purchase accounting of 0 01 per share for the full fiscal year our consolidated gaap gross margin increased 90 basis points and non gaap gross margin increased 110 basis points again the majority of the gross margin increase was due to changes in our consolidated business mix driven by the growth in retail and the contribution from joybird both of which carry a higher gross margin than our wholesale business fiscal 2019 gaap results also include the purchase accounting charges related to our acquisition that were 20 basis points higher than the prior fiscal looking at gross margin percentages by segment we experienced a decline in upholstery due to higher supply chain costs and changes to our product mix which were offset somewhat by higher selling prices gross margin improved in our casegoods segment for the year primarily driven by increased volume and a shift in product mix to new higher margin collections our retail segment s gross margin increased primarily due to the increased design services and custom sales as well as the benefit of acquired stores that have higher margins than our average stores moving on to sg a for the year gaap sg a as a percent of sales increased 170 basis points in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 non gaap sg a increased 150 basis points adjusted for acquisition related costs for joybird changes in our consolidated business mix increased sg a by 200 basis points for the year reflecting the growth of joybird and retail for roughly three quarters of the year that we own them in addition incentive compensation costs as a percentage of sales were 80 basis points higher for fiscal 2019 due to our improved financial performance against incentive targets partially offsetting higher sg a was the improved leverage of fixed costs on higher sales dollars our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 26 4 compared with 36 7 in fiscal 2018 both periods reflect the impact of tax reform but the statutory rate for each year differed due to our april year end as tax reform was phased in during our fiscal 2018 year absent discrete items the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 would have been 25 1 for fiscal 2020 looking forward absent discrete items we estimate our effective tax rate will continue to be in the range of 25 to 26 regarding our significant non cash pension termination charge recall that as part of the redesign of our employee benefits plans we terminated our defined benefit pension plan for eligible factory hourly employees during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we settled all future obligations under the plan through a combination of lump sum payments to eligible participants who elected to receive them and transferred the remaining benefit obligations to a highly rated insurance company in connection with this we recognized a non cash pre tax charge of 33 million on our consolidated statement of income which equated to 0 58 per share we did not have to contribute any additional operating cash into the plan to settle the obligation both the cash usage and the non cash p l charge were significantly lower than we initially expected due to favorable developments in the risk premiums we were able to secure and the number of individuals electing lump sum payments terminating the plan transfers the administration costs and risks of planned funding going forward and allows us to fund more meaningful benefit programs for our employees turning to the balance sheet in fiscal 2019 we generated 151 million in cash from operating activities we ended the year with 131 million 130 million in cash and cash equivalents 31 million in investments to enhance returns on cash and 2 million in restricted cash during fiscal 2019 we invested 48 million in capital expenditures primarily related to our new innovation center in dayton tennessee upgrades to our dayton manufacturing facility and construction of a new corporate office building for our england subsidiary for the full fiscal year we paid 23 million in dividends and spent 23 million purchasing 800 000 shares of stock in the open market under our existing authorized share repurchase program which leaves 5 9 million shares of purchase availability under that authorization we also repaid the remaining 20 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit line in the fourth quarter our capital allocation priorities remain to invest in the business to drive growth and then provide returns to shareholders with our dividends and discretionary share buyback and finally turning to our fiscal 2020 year let me highlight several important items regarding leases beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we will adopt the new accounting standard on leases and we ll record all lease debt and related right of use assets on our balance sheet we estimate we will record amounts in the range of 300 million to 325 million on the balance sheet and we do not anticipate any material impact to our income statement regarding capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 we expect capex to be in the range of 50 million to 60 million including plant upgrades and improvements to several of our retail stores regarding tariffs the environment remains volatile as noted earlier we expect to continue to pass through tariffs as a surcharge resulting in higher selling prices and we believe with our supply chain structure we are competitively well positioned against our peers however with the broader industry having a negative start to calendar 2019 we may see an impact on demand elasticity with increased tariffs regarding seasonality our first quarter is typically the weakest in terms of sales and earnings across our businesses due to a general slowdown throughout the furniture industry related to the summer period as a result the majority of our manufacturing facility is closed for a week in july for vacation and maintenance and with lower volume during that period in addition to the one week without production and shipments we historically convert at a lower rate during the first quarter further into the year our changing consolidated sales mix may also affect seasonality of the consolidated company for our retail segment and joybird the third quarter is typically the highest volume sales quarter while the fourth quarter is typically our strongest on our wholesale upholstery businesses as the retail and joybird businesses grow as a percentage of our consolidated sales third quarter sales could outpace or be level with fourth quarter for the consolidated company in future years regarding sg a cost trends in addition to normal inflationary pressures we would again note the impact of changes in our consolidated business mix with retail growing and the acquisition of joybird which will again drive an approximate 200 basis point to 250 basis point increase in sg a for the first quarter versus fiscal year s versus last year s fiscal first quarter when we did not yet own joybird or the arizona retail businesses we estimate this mix impact for the full year to be an sg a increase in the range of 100 basis points to 150 basis points while on the topic of sg a i would note that we have more heavily front loaded advertising investment in the year to support the first quarter launch of our campaign featuring kristen bell in fiscal 2020 and on quarterly results more broadly i would remind you that we anticipate joybird becoming slightly profitable in the back half of fiscal 2020 excluding purchase accounting adjustments for comparability let me note that in fiscal 2019 first quarter results included a 0 03 per share benefit from currency and employee benefits changes resulted in one time 0 07 per share benefit to q3 offset partially with a 0 03 additional charge in q4 all of these items being in 2019 and one time in nature and finally we will continue with our non gaap presentation as we go into 2020 excluding purchase accounting adjustments for acquisitions to date adjustments are anticipated to be in the range of 0 08 to 0 10 per share for the fiscal year plus any effect from reevaluation of the contingent consideration liability for future earn outs on joybird as a reminder this earn out could range from 0 million to 65 million as we ve discussed extensively in previous quarters and now i ll turn the call back to kurt for concluding remarks kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer thank you melinda in the shorter term we are facing several hurdles with a fluid tariff environment geopolitical uncertainty and the negative growth posted by the furniture industry for the first calendar quarter but with that said with our strong brand multi channel distribution network and predominately domestic manufacturing footprint we believe we are competitively well positioned in the marketplace additionally our balance sheet is strong which will allow us to weather a possible economic downturn i m so proud of the work that la z boy team has accomplished this year we are playing offense and implementing creative solutions to optimize our portfolio of powerhouse brands maximize the reach and efficiencies of our supply chain and capture new and different consumers we are excited about the future narrative of la z boy and believe the best is yet to come we appreciate your interest in la z boy incorporated and now i ll turn over the call to kathy to provide the instructions for getting into the queue kathy liebmann director investor relations and corporate communications thank you kurt we ll begin the question and answer period now christie will you please review the instructions for getting into the queue to ask questions questions and answers operator absolutely thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions and we ll take our first question from bradley thomas with keybanc capital markets please go ahead bradley thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning kurt melinda and kathy let s see i wanted to focus on the sales trends and just follow up on the slowdown that you all experienced in the quarter in the upholstery and casegood segments and kurt if you could just give us an update about how you re thinking about the health of those two segments going forward particularly when you contrast it against what s been very strong same store sales and strong merchandise and an exciting new advertising campaign that s been helping your retail segment kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer well i would have a couple of comments on that brad number one we reminded people earlier that we are in the furniture business and everybody that reported numbers in the first four months five months of the year showed a slowdown and we weren t immune to that but our us business is fairly healthy but then you take the effects for the la z boy brand then you take the effects of we ve got a significant business in canada which we talked about in the call we ve got a business in the uk and with what s going on there and when things get a little tougher sometimes our non branded companies don t do quite as well as the la z boy brand so it s a mixture of things there that we re dealing with and similarly we talked in february about we were pleased with presidents day weekend and things got softer after that we were very pleased with the memorial day weekend but that s no prediction that the trend is going to continue so we don t think there s anything systemically wrong i think you see with our store performance that the core la z boy brand is holding up real well but we ve got some other parts of that business that have normally they ve been consistent with the la z boy brand and for the last few months that hasn t been the case bradley thomas keybanc capital markets analyst and then with respect to the price increases that you are putting through can you just give us an update as of today how much are prices up maybe year over year and as you look forward the next couple of quarters do we need to put through more price increases given the timing that raw materials are coming in and goods are coming in that are hit with the tariff how should we think about that kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer i think we outlined that brad pretty well in the call we took a 2 and 3 increase on the first round of tariffs which was some time ago and this next time around it s melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer we re up to with the chinese tariffs on our portfolio we re up to about 4 across the portfolio it depends on if you re a power or a non power on the chinese tariffs of course everything s volatile that s what the adjustment the first round of chinese tariffs we took that first round we re up to call it across the blended portfolio just under 5 on chinese tariffs mexico came and went in the last couple of weeks which would have created another round of pricing canada has come off so at this point we are with just pricing that has come out in two weeks three weeks ago we are whole in what we re trying to pass through what we don t know is how the elasticities will be impacted on that pricing or what else will come along in the next round of tariffs which again we would still try to pass through but at some point you re just hitting an elasticity point that could be troubling particularly on the back of recall over the last two years the industry has seen some pretty significant upticks in raw material charges that we re starting to see become a tailwind instead of a headwind but overall furniture prices have certainly taken an uptick over the last two years kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer yeah and i think we saw that the combination of all those things really hit the wall in canada when you add on the currency so i think some of the furniture coming from america and canada is 30 40 more expensive now given the currency so there could come a time brad when the effect on volume and not running our plans at the level we want to is better than passing on more tariff but we don t believe we ve reached that point yet but we ll keep a watchful eye on it bradley thomas keybanc capital markets analyst great and if i could add one more on joybird it s really been experiencing some exciting growth can you help us think about how much you think joybird could be up this coming year just obviously can i know you i ll tend to not hide on sales but obviously it could create a lot of variability given how fast it s been growing historically for example how much was the 22 million up year over year in 4q and again how are you thinking about it going forward kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer well we re not going to give you exact but i would say honestly we don t know because we are slightly behind in the integration plan we had but we re very pleased that we are making their product now in dayton tennessee we are we have filled our regional distribution centers with their products so they can get consumers can get product in a week or less having half the line made on the east coast cuts down the time and the transportation costs but i just if you did run out of progression brad we bought them when they were on a 50 million to 55 million pace and now after owning them for less than nine months we believe they re on a 70 million to 80 million pace and we would expect that to be a higher pace all next year if everything we have comes together now another worry there if the mexican tariffs ever come back into play they would be affected on that with the full tariff burden on finished goods which would be significantly more price or profit than we anticipated but everything from our standpoint everything is going as planned it s just not going as fast as we want but the teams are working hard on getting everything integrated and the big takeaway here though for our company this gives us a new customer and a new channel that we re not attracting with a la z boy brand or in the la z boy stores and it s very accretive to everything we re trying to do from a growth standpoint bradley thomas keybanc capital markets analyst that s very helpful thank you so much kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer thank you brad operator operator instructions and our next question comes from anthony lebiedzinski with sidoti company please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst yes good morning and thank you for taking the question so i just wanted to follow up about the mexico so obviously there was a recent threat to potential tariffs that went away but longer term are you perhaps rethinking your supply chain or is it just too early at this point how are you guys thinking about that kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer i think the broader answer to that anthony and good morning to you too i think we think our supply chain all the time so we re flexible we re nimble there s been a big move to vietnam in the industry with products out of china we still think mexico is advantageous to us from a speed standpoint and for us to deliver the customer order promise in four weeks or less it would be hard to do that we might be able to save a little bit of money but it would destroy one of the competitive advantages we have is doing custom and we today in the la z boy furniture gallery stores nearly 50 of all our business is either in home design or custom so there s more factors than just costs and we also don t want to make one bet in any one country outside of the united states or one currency so we are flexible on how much of a given commodity or anything that we do in these various countries so it s ever changing there is no roadmap because these things are just fluid right now and get announced and you have to react but we ve got a number of contingency plans should something change permanently that we can react to anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst all right that s good to hear so moving on to a different topic so in your 10 k you talked about your expectation for higher costs in fiscal 20 for raw materials transportation which includes ocean freight costs and some other things so can you perhaps give us some more detail as to what you guys expect from a cost perspective melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah just to clarify raw material inputs have actually become a tailwind so some of those steel poly and some of our wood input costs that were at all time highs call it six months to 12 months ago have actually become a tailwind consistent with the rest of the industry but it s the rest of our input costs that continue to see increases and so that was really the the point of that comment is to make the point of it s a balance while we appreciate being able to leverage the tailwinds of some of those raw material costs that we price for over the last two years we are seeing other input costs and as you know transportation being one of them that are definitely up year over year and we don t see those trends easing and similar with just employee costs including insurances health insurance and those type of benefits anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay thanks for that explanation and clarification so as far as the retail segment obviously another good quarter there you mentioned that you did have a higher ticket driving that delivered same store sales increase can you give us a sense as to the magnitude i just wanted to get a better understanding of traffic versus ticket as to what s driving the performance there and whether and also while we re at that subject your thoughts on the sustainability of that going forward kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer well let me talk about the mix between average ticket and traffic it changes monthly it s not a consistent number our traffic has kind of leveled out at a degree that is good for us we re not seeing the 6 8 10 down traffic anymore so it s stabilized frankly in the last four months some months traffic has been slightly up and slightly down so that s a positive sign we anticipate the traffic to get a bump with our increased investment in kristen bell and the brand platform and so but it s just it s all a matter of the our four sales people our retail consultants our designers connecting with the customer making them aware of everything la z boy has to offer and talking about being able to do your whole room or a series of rooms rather than selling individual items and that s really been the story that we the journey we ve been on for the last number of years and unless we would see a pretty substantial economic slowdown which is not in our plan for this year i would not see a degradation to the ticket in the new horizon and think the same store growth is can continue to go up anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it okay thanks for that and lastly as far as the up spending on advertising that you previously mentioned can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of that up spend melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we don t call out specific numbers but obviously given that we ve made an investment in kristen we want to make sure we get the maximum bang for our buck there i guess i would say so we definitely are investing a bit more into marketing this year in conjunction with our licensee partners so across the entire furniture galleries network and that is more heavily skewed than would normally be the case into the front half of the year particularly first quarter with the launch anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it all right thank you and best of luck melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer thank you anthony operator and our next question comes from bobby griffin with raymond james please go ahead bobby griffin raymond james analyst good morning everybody and i appreciate you taking my questions kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer good morning bobby bobby griffin raymond james analyst kurt i want to go back to your comments about the furniture prices in canada with currency raw materials and tariffs they were upwards of up 30 40 year over year when did at what price level did you start to see the deterioration in unit volumes was it 15 or 20 just so i can we can get a flavor of what might be the tipping point here in the us on prices kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer yeah that s a hard i don t have that data right here in front of me bobby and then i would go back to the statement melinda made the tariffs and all were on top of the raw material increases that happened within the last two years too so it s not any one of those things individually those could have all been dealt with it s the cumulative effect of raw materials for that hitting all time high transportation cost all that then the us tariffs the chinese tariffs the retaliatory tariffs and then the double whammy for canada is the currency so all i can tell you is that as the things escalated in our fiscal 19 each quarter last year our business in canada continued on a downward slope and it was very refreshing to see a change in that direction in may one quarter doesn t make the year one month doesn t make the year but we saw the gap to the us performance and our canada business both wholesale and retail every quarter in 19 go down and down and down each quarter percentage wise bobby griffin raymond james analyst okay and the one thing that changed in may was just the removal of the retaliatory tariff kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer that s the biggest thing i m not i don t have in front of me i don t know what the currency did off the top of my head and that came down a little bit too but certainly the tariff coming off was a relief and i don t have fresh intelligence on what our retail partners are doing how much of that they re passing on how much they re reading themselves how they re merchandising at but obviously that was a bit of very good news and there has to be some correlation between that and the change of direction of the pace of the business melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer and always keep in mind while the chinese tariffs are on component parts so 25 equates to 4 kind of increase than what we re passing through that chinese that canadian tariff was 10 on finished goods so that going away is a really dramatic impact than immediate bobby griffin raymond james analyst okay i appreciate that and then secondly for me if you look on i guess in your non branded wholesale business the slowdown that happened call it year to date with some of the weather was there any meaningful change in the kind of level of products people were ordering or purchasing like a trade down instead of buying 2 000 sofa you saw more common of 1 200 sofa just to get a sense if your non branded retail partners are seeing something different out of their consumers kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer my sense is that with the marketing and the effort behind a brand and our stores and all the things that we do we are not the first level of distribution that sees this impact but a lot of what our non branded businesses appeal to our smaller dealers dealers and rural communities dealers who need a distributor supplier to help them and i think typical to past slowdowns we start seeing some of our smaller dealers suffer earlier or faster than the major they just they don t have as many options given the benefit of scale that some of the rest of our the big customers have so we didn t see it at any one geography area anyone customer segment but i think there is some indication that some of the smaller dealers may be feeling the effects of all this conversation about the world going on affecting their customers a little more bobby griffin raymond james analyst okay i appreciate that and then when we look at the first half of next fiscal year and comp for the higher advertising the traditional 1q slowdown on maybe some of the inflationary pressures and a little bit of uncertainty here should we assume for first half operating income to be down year over year or any color there to help us maybe rightsize the model versus last year and this is on a non gaap basis i m sorry melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i m hesitant to get into anything that feels like guidance per se but certainly there are challenges to our summer months kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer and i bobby the hesitance of us to answer that question so it was announced yesterday i guess that our president and the chinese premier are going to meet and so what if they leave from there and there s a big change then obviously we would all be more optimistic i m not optimistic necessarily that s going to happen but the predictability of what is going to happen in the next six months given what s happened in the last six months and the you don t get a lot of time to plan for these things that get announced overnight so it s you just go through a litany of things if the interest rates are cut through this or that so you make your models for a lot of companies you re probably as good at it right now as we are but we don t have a crystal ball we have a crystal ball of what we re planning to do and how we re executing and where we think our pinch points are and all that but as far as the broader economy and all the things that are going on it s not easy to predict bobby griffin raymond james analyst okay and i guess i ll try to sneak one more in here melinda can you maybe just update us on capital allocation how do you view the leases in terms of the total debt do you have a total adjusted debt target or net debt target that you look at now with the leases and on share buyback was down a little bit this year as stocks kind of pulled back here a little bit how should we think about share buybacks going forward melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we i mean broadly the lease accounting change is a paper accounting change right so that really doesn t change how we think about debt or overall managing our balance sheet as you know we ve been pretty conservative in recent years on how we manage the balance sheet we have essentially no debt right now other than the leases and we i guess the second piece of that is relative to cash usage in the year we had two big things this year paying off those two as this past year paying off those two acquisitions as well as we expect to need to put a healthy sum of money into terminating the pension and so we did back off a bit on share buyback for that reason knowing we had some unusual uses in the year in general we ve always said that sure first we will invest in our business and then we ll give money back to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchase at minimum we would always offset any dilution but this past year was a bit of an abnormality and how much share buyback we did because of the other uses in the year bobby griffin raymond james analyst okay i appreciate you guys taking all my questions best of luck going forward in the summer and some of this uncertainty in front of us melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer makes it fun operator and we have a final question from dillard watt with stifel please go ahead dillard watt stifel nicolaus company analyst thanks good morning melinda i want to talk a little bit about capex it was up in 2019 i think primarily due to the new innovation center in dayton and then i think as well as some i guess sort of ongoing improvements in the manufacturing and we re now moving up again 50 million to 60 million this year could you help kind of bridge the difference between maybe moving from fiscal 18 to 19 and now into 20 and maybe how much of that is just the timing of store projects and sort of what s the maybe longer term go forward rate we can think about melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer sure when we i think we ve been more as you said in the 30 million to 40 million range historically we definitely are in the process of making investments to modernize some of our plans and we ve talked a lot about those building the dayton innovation center as well as making updates to our dayton tennessee plant i think we start in 2019 calling capex more in the 60 million to 70 million range i may be off on that a little bit but what we actually ended up spending in 2019 actually came down a bit simply as we finished up all those dayton tennessee projects the plant projects a bit of that spend has slid into our 2020 numbers so that s why you see us right now calling a number in the 50 million to 60 million range for 2020 is the carryover of some of those final projects in dayton and another plant update and so forth i do think after that i would anticipate in the out years starting to see that maybe not revert all the way down to the 30 million 40 million you saw in the past but these are definitely big investment years as we finish out some of the plant work we want to do on top of the ongoing projects as you mentioned always on store renovations and of course investment in our own infrastructure as well it projects and those type of things kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer dillard i would add this is not a new phenomenon what we ve been doing in the last seven years or eight years is we went through a long period of time the recession prior to that when we made some ill fated acquisitions and all but we didn t have any capital to invest so we went a long time without keeping our facilities in the manner that we should so we ve been playing catch up with our it systems and five years ago four years ago we built the new headquarters we spent a lot of money in dayton our distribution centers have all been moved and upgraded our last big project is going to kick off this year and that is in our neosho missouri plant and if you think about the dayton plant that we re just finishing up and neosho they manufacture nearly 70 of all the furniture we sell in the us so it s critical that those facilities are up to date have new technology and are pleasant places to work for our people because every place we have a business we re in a talent war to keep our people and give them some amenities so this is the last really big facility that we have to but given 150 stores that we own and six plants and all the store models and everything this business needs capital investment every year or you get far behind and you have to play catch up we re trying to get to a point where hopefully in a year or two we can give you a normal capex maintenance part of our capex that you can count on and hopefully after this year we ll be in a position to start being more forthright about what we think that will take dillard watt stifel nicolaus company analyst understood that s helpful and then maybe melinda just any sort of help you might provide on what you expect working capital to do this year understanding that certainly potentially depends on sales which is a little bit uncertain but there s anything that will push that one way or another that will be great melinda whittington senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean as you said it s all dependent on the business growth right but i would point out that i mean if you look at our q4 cash flow delivery we had a particularly good year in 19 of managing our working capital relative to the business so certainly our intention would be to continue to do that but that s always a challenge i don t see we don t have anything on cap ph where we are planning to make some big move on terms or anything to see something dramatic again other than i d call out we put a lot of focus on working capital this year and drove some quite good results here in the fourth quarter dillard watt stifel nicolaus company analyst understood thank you kurt l darrow chairman president and chief executive officer thank you dillard operator and that does conclude our q a session for today i ll turn it back over to kathy kurt and melinda for closing remarks kathy liebmann director investor relations and corporate communications thank you everyone for joining us on our call this morning if you have follow up questions please give me a call and i will be in touch with you have a great day

source imgflip all investors have long term financial goals we d like to reach and those of us on seeking alpha are also on a quest to hopefully beat the market the alpha we re seeking while there are many approaches you can use to strive for these goals i personally believe in following the footsteps of some of the greatest investors in history including while each of these investors had slightly different strategies there are three common themes each used to not just beat the market but crush it over significant lengths of time strong focus on valuation contrarian focus zig when others zag incredible patience some of lynch s best investments didn t even break even until the end of year four personally i am not in the cigar butt buy a 1 for 0 5 school that graham famously founded and buffett used in his early years of running his hedge fund rather i prefer to follow buffett s later approach also used by greenblatt of buying wonderful companies at a fair price while i normally buy undervalued blue chips each week because numerous studies show that time in the market is more important than timing the market i also like to be opportunistic that means grabbing shares of quality dividend payers when prices crash on overreactions to certain events such as earnings misses normally i do this with dividend aristocrats and kings but i ll also use it for gold standards in certain industries this is why i recently bought an opening position in broadcom nasdaq avgo in my retirement portfolio where i keep 100 of my life savings 10 shares 258 11 on june 14th about 9 5 crash at the open commission 0 37 on interactive broker s tiered pricing let me walk you through the five reasons why i considered broadcom a great buffett style opportunistic buy even after the share price has recovered a bit it s still a potentially great long term investment for anyone seeking generous safe and growing yield plus double digit market potential that s because even at 266 broadcom is between 11 and 16 undervalued which for an industry leader of this caliber makes it a strong buy and likely to deliver about 17 long term cagr total returns over the next five to 10 years reason 1 the downward guidance revision was obviously coming i was actually watching broadcom s earnings closely precisely because i was all but certain that management would cut its 2019 guidance and the famously short term focused market would likely react badly to that not surprisingly broadcom did lower its guidance reducing 2019 revenue guidance entirely in its chip making business by 2 billion or 8 as ceo hock tan who i consider the buffett bezos of this industry told analysts at the q1 conference call looking at the second quarter just passed it really went as planned networking continued to perform very well and our broadband business started to recover this was offset by the anticipated sharp decline in wireless and the ongoing softness in storage hock tan emphasis added and of course given that huawei is now blacklisted by the us government the company will not see the 900 million roughly 4 of company revenue that it normally would for as long as the us china trade conflict persists and we can t forget that chip makers are literally the most trade sensitive companies you can own us companies with most revenues from china by tariff standards sources ubs lipper financial this explains why this already highly volatile and economically sensitive industry prone to large swings in sales and cash flow from year to year is now trading wildly based on every trade related rumor and presidential tweet here s hock tan again explaining the effects of the trade war on broadcom s business in the second half we had expected a recovery however while enterprise and mainframe software demand remained stable particularly in north america and europe with respect to semiconductors it is clear that the u s china trade conflict including the huawei export ban is creating economic and political uncertainty and reducing visibility for our global oem customers we now anticipate fiscal 2019 semiconductor solutions segment revenue of 17 5 billion which translates into a year over year decline in the high single digits basically compression of supply chain is what s driving this reduction more than anything else and it s broad based hock tan emphasis added the second half recovery for chip makers that some companies had expected but which texas instruments warned was likely not coming until 2020 is now likely dead due entirely to the heightened trade uncertainties ok so that s the bad news but here s why i was thrilled to set my buy order on thursday night after reviewing the company s earnings which were actually very good reason 2 meaning the big sell off was an overreaction first let s consider broadcom s actual q1 results revenues thanks to the 18 9 billion ca tech acquisition last year were up 10 and free cash flow what pays the dividend and ultimately is the source of long term stock value was up 20 the company also repurchased and eliminated 4 7 million shares reducing its share count by about 1 so fcf share up 21 yoy what about the big decrease in guidance for 2019 well let s put that in context according to tom krause the company s cfo despite the challenging market backdrop and updated revenue outlook we still expect to grow free cash flow by a double digit percentage for the year in addition we remain focused on completing a total of 8 billion of share repurchases and eliminations in fiscal 2019 tom krause emphasis added broadcom s combination of double digit fcf growth this year plus 8 billion in buybacks should drive 13 to 15 fcf share growth this year what about future guidance cuts well ceo hock tan says the company s current guidance bakes in the worst case trade war scenario i think at this point we try to capture everything including that proposed next round of tariffs into the picture now let s compare that objectively excellent growth rate to what analysts expect from the broader market in general and trade sensitive tech companies in particular source factset research the s p 500 is now expected to deliver just 3 bottom line growth this year while the tech industry is expected to put up zero growth rival chip makers like skyworks swks and texas instruments txn are both expected to post earnings growth of 14 and 7 this year respectively in other words thanks to that controversial at the time ca tech acquisition broadcom is looking at some of the best industry sector and overall earnings cash flow growth rates this year and speaking of the ca tech acquisition here s what hock tan had to say about how that complex integration is going the integration of ca is progressing well we remain confident that we can meet if not exceed the long term revenue and profitability targets that we laid out for ca to you last year renewals in our ca business are strong and the dollar commitments from our core customers continue to grow hock tan emphasis added according to the harvard business review 70 to 90 of mergers fail to deliver long term shareholder value so to hear that broadcom is on track to meet or even exceed its cost cut cutting goals is great news indeed management s plans for ca tech s mainframe software business is to use a microsoft msft like approach to moving clients from a licensing model to a recurring subscription one that should ultimately deliver 1 4 billion in cost savings driving up ca tech s operating earnings by 127 and means that broadcom would have paid just 7 6 times operating earnings for that company source broadcom ca tech acquisition fact sheet and let s not forget the main reason broadcom bought ca tech in the first place that would be to triple its addressable market size and achieve a large amount 20 of revenue from stable and recurring sources what s more thanks to buying ca tech management expects long term earnings cash flow and dividend growth to be in the double digits for the foreseeable future source investor presentation in the highly volatile semiconductor industry stable cash flow 22 of revenue from software in 2019 is worth its weight in gold especially if you care about safe dividends which brings me to the third reason for buying broadcom during this time of elevated fear uncertainty and doubt reason 3 broadcom is still a wonderful company as i said in the intro while i m a dedicated value contrarian investor i m in no way interested in cigar butt companies meaning struggling businesses that are trading so cheap you might still earn great returns rather i m looking at quality first and valuation second since i intend to hold my companies for many years or even decades as long as the thesis remains intact thus i only consider stocks on my 189 company and growing blue chip watchlist which ranks all companies on a three factor quality score dividend safety score 4 5 above average business model 3 3 above average management quality 3 3 excellent total quality score 10 11 swan i will only own level 8 11 or higher blue chips or swans stocks because these are firms that i expect will deliver safe and rising dividends throughout economic industry cycles personally i require all my companies to pay me for patiently waiting for management to deliver on their growth plans 45 of my quality score is based on dividend safety since i wish to avoid yield traps at all costs company yield ttm fcf payout ratio simply safe dividends safety score out of 100 sensei dividend safety score out of 5 sensei

safe dividends broadcom s dividend safety isn t perfect due to its m a focused business model which results in higher than industry average debt levels however as far as the payout ratio goes broadcom is well below the 50 safe limit for chip makers 50 dividend payout ratio is management s long term goal company net debt ebitda interest coverage ratio s p credit rating average interest cost ttm return on invested capital broadcom 3 4 9 3 bbb 3 7 9 depressed due to ca tech acquisition safe level 1 5 or below 8 or above bbb or higher below roic 12 or higher click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends f a s t graphs gurufocus morningstar conference call i and simply safe dividends where i m an analyst aren t the only ones who wish broadcom s debt was lower although the debt load appears material for a semiconductor firm we think broadcomâ s diverse set of profitable business lines will generate sufficient cash to more than service its outstanding debt while also allowing the firm to remain on the hunt for attractive deals morningstar emphasis added but it s important to remember that broadcom isn t just any m a happy tech stock the company has proven it knows what it s doing in terms of debt funded deals here s its cfo explaining how the company manages to keep borrowing costs low we also refinanced our 18 billion of term loans that we put in place at the beginning of fiscal 2019 to finance the ca acquisition via a combination of 11 billion of investment grade bonds and a new term loan we re able to extend our average debt maturity to approximately five years and substantially reduce the quantum of debt due in any one year as of today our average cost of borrowing stands at approximately 3 7 tom krause emphasis added source investor presentation this is a company that s built its empire on the back of brilliantly executed strategic deals that have led to truly sensational growth over the years putting most of its peers to shame morningstar s abhinav davuluri summarizes broadcom s m a track record thusly as a serial acquirer broadcom has seemingly perfected the process of purchasing semiconductor companies with best of breed products at attractive valuations trimming noncore product lines to streamline the business and ultimately driving nice cost synergies morningstar emphasis added and here s motley fool s ashraf eassa with why he considers broadcom management to be among the best in the industry broadcom is singularly adept at acquiring and integrating businesses in a way that undeniably creates shareholder value broadcom wouldn t be where it is today without a highly capable and focused management team at the helm and in case you want actual financial data to back up the fact that broadcom is this industry s master of profitable deals here s the last five years worth of financial data source investor presentation more important than revenue profits or margin expansion is the fact that broadcom s free cash flow operating cash flow minus capex r d and what funds the dividend has been growing like a weed source investor presentation and as its cfo just told analysts broadcom is on track for 9 billion in fcf this year highlighting the fact that it s a cash minting machine source simply safe dividends in fact broadcom s 12 month fcf margin is nearly 50 about ten times the level of a quality chip maker for context consider texas instruments the other gold standard in this industry but one that s focused on organic growth rather than m a source txn investor presentation texas instrument s aims for long term 30 fcf margins which puts it in the top 6 of all s p 500 companies by fcf generation broadcom s fcf margin puts it firmly in the top 5 and makes it one of the best fcf generators in all of corporate america or indeed the world ca tech was bought at a fair price because its stable but none growing business was an fcf machine that management is now making even more profitable source investor presentation and like texas instruments which i also own 6 of my life savings broadcom is very shareholder friendly with its river of free cash flow the company aims to pay out 50 of annual fcf as dividends retaining the other half for opportunistic buybacks debt repayments or future acquisitions in 5g chips the main long term growth thesis hock tan expects the industry to grow at mid to high single digits in the coming years with broadcom s strong 21 000 patent ip portfolio allowing to grow its chip business slightly faster 5 to 10 5 revenue growth on the low end of guidance might sound rather slow but keep in mind that management s long term double digit guidance is predicated on around 5 sales growth for the company with margin expansion and buybacks helping to boost the bottom line about double that rate add in data center chips and iot including driverless cars plus future m a and you can see why management and analysts expect about 11 long term eps and fcf share growth from this blue chip semiconductor maker and given management s 50 payout ratio policy that means dividends can be expected to grow at roughly 11 as well in the coming years for a high quality and well run company as this growing at double digits i consider today s share price to offer a potentially great value for long term income investors reason 4 that s trading at a fair price broadcom s long term thesis of a safe 4 yielding dividend and double digit payout growth remains intact and don t just take my word for it here s morningstar s take our long term view remains unchanged and as we articulated in a recent note the crux of our investment thesis on broadcom and other large cap semi names is that the brinksmanship between the u s and china is not a structural erosion of end market demand but rather negotiating chips that will ultimately be resolved end market demand supported by secular trends driving the need for increased connectivity and lower latency adjustments for near term weakness are offset by the time value of money and other puts and takes in our model leaving our 300 fair value estimate intact with shares down in hours we see an attractive entry point for investors to own this semiconductor stalwart morningstar emphasis added unless you think that the us china trade war is going to last forever and permanently slow global economic growth and thus reduce demand for 5g technology significantly broadcom s current pe ratio of 12 6 is a potentially attractive buying opportunity source f a s t graphs granted 12 6 times earnings is not that much below the 13 8 historical average but remember my goal with broadcom isn t to buy at a deep value price but buy a wonderful company at a fair price and with both management and analysts still expecting double digit long term eps and fcf share growth broadcom s pe expanding to merely its long term average would generate 16 2 cagr total returns but while i m a fan of the pe ratio as a valuation method my two favorite valuation approaches are slightly different my favorite blue chip valuation method is dividend yield theory or dyt this has been the only approach used by asset manager newsletter publisher investment quality trends since 1966 dyt which compares a stock s yield to its historical norm has been the only approach iqt has used for 53 years and only on blue chips to deliver market beating returns with 10 lower volatility to boot source investment quality trends according to hulbert financial digest iqt s 30 year risk adjusted total returns are the best of any us investing newsletter basically dyt is the most effective long term valuation approach i ve yet found which is why it s at the heart of my retirement portfolio s strategy and drives many of my article recommendations dyt merely compares a company s yield to its historical norm because assuming the business model remains relatively stable over time yields like most valuation metrics tend to revert to historical levels that approximate fair value company yield 5 year average yield estimated discount to fair value upside to fair value 5 10 year valuation boost cagr broadcom 4 0 3 4 16 19 1 8 to 3 5 click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends dividend yield theory gordon dividend growth model f a s t graphs management guidance moneychimp dyt estimates that broadcom is modestly undervalued right now meaning about 19 upside to fair value spread out over a five to 10 year time frame that amounts to a 1 8 to 3 5 annual boost to total returns i use dyt as one end of my valuation range and morningstar s intrinsic value estimates as the other to minimize the chance of a thesis breaking event causing me to incorrectly recommend putting money including my own into a value trap company current price estimated fair value moat management quality discount to fair value long term valuation boost broadcom 265 97 300 medium uncertainty narrow stable trend standard average 11 1 2 to 2 4 click to enlarge source morningstar morningstar analysts are famous for their conservative growth assumptions thus creating low ball discounted cash flow based intrinsic value estimates that are relatively immune to short term events such as the trade war morningstar doesn t rate broadcom as highly as i do in terms of its moat or management quality yet still thinks its future cash flow is worth 300 today that implies an 11 discount to fair value and a modest 1 to 2 annual valuation boost my official valuation estimate uses dyt and morningstar s estimates to create a range of 11 to 16 undervalued so about 14 that s good enough to make broadcom a strong buy on my blue chip valuation scale because of the great return potential this business now offers patient and volatility tolerant income investors reason 5 creating double digit long term return potential since 1954 a relatively accurate way of forecasting long term total returns for dividend stocks has been the gordon dividend growth model what brookfield asset management and nextera energy both use this simply says that over time total return yield long term cash flow dividend growth valuations are mean reverting and unless the thesis breaks cancel out over time while that s true for periods over 10 years for time horizons of 5 to 10 years valuation mean reversion can lead to some impressive total returns from low risk blue chips company yield 5 year expected earnings growth total return expected no valuation change valuation adjusted total return potential 5 10 years cagr broadcom 4 0 11 1 15 1 16 3 to 18 6 s p 500 1 9 6 1 8 0 1 to 8 click to enlarge source simply safe dividends management guidance f a s t graphs morningstar management guidance yardeni research yahoo finance multipl com gordon dividend growth model dividend yield theory moneychimp analyst estimates even if you assume broadcom s valuation will remain constant over time the current growth outlook both management and analysts combined with a safe 4 yield still results in expected long term returns of 15 compare that to the 1 to 8 analysts expect from the s p 500 over the coming five to 10 years asset manager forward five to 10 year market total return forecasts source 2019 morningstar long term return survey then add in broadcom s price merely returning to fair value and you get 16 to 19 long term return potential or roughly three to four times what the market might do in the coming years add it all up and i consider broadcom a potentially attractive long term buy for anyone comfortable with its risk profile and wants to buy it as part of a well diversified and properly constructed portfolio risks to keep in mind in the short term broadcom s biggest risks come from two areas the ongoing trade war and weakness in smartphones 30 of sales are in smartphone chips with about 20 of that coming from apple aapl smartphone sales over time source statista until 5g really ramps up smartphone sales aren t expected to significantly improve and even when 5g phones become mainstream the growth is expected to be modest fortunately broadcom s main growth drivers aren t phones but iot and data center chips as for the trade war well on that front the news is far from optimal currently the us is placing 25 tariffs on about 40 of chinese imports according to the latest reports from cnbc president trump has said that if some kind of deal isn t reached at the g 20 summit in osaka japan on june 28th and 29th 25 tariffs on the remaining 60 of imports 300 billion could go into effect immediately now it s not necessarily true that the us can do that since there is a 90 day comment period that s required for initiating new tariffs but on monday june 17th the us began official hearings from companies which indicates that trump isn t bluffing about the final round of chinese tariffs if a deal is reached most likely just a deal to make a deal later and resume negotiations then trade sensitive stocks like broadcom are likely to soar if tariffs get announced for july september then they could crash marko kolanovic j p morganâ s global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy recently wrote â the u s economy is facing a quite unique situation in which one individual can disrupt global trade and investment plans of u s corporations tax consumers on a broad range of imports etc given all of this â why are we not bearish on equities and the economy because this situation can also be undone on short notice and many market segments already price in worst case outcomes this would translate into a quick 5 rally in broad markets and a 10 20 rally in value and high beta as a strong market and avoiding a recession would boost re election odds it would only be rational to expect this outcome â jpmorgan emphasis added i tend to agree with mr koanovic that a final deal is likely coming in late 2019 or early 2020 but even an interim deal that avoids the final 300 billion tariff round would likely mean big gains for trade economically sensitive stocks in the chip maker energy financial basic material industries this is why i ve been focusing my recent buys on those industries if a deal is delayed i ll have plenty of liquidity and room in my portfolio to keep adding at even better valuations but this is where proper risk management diversification and asset allocation mix of stocks bonds cash comes in here s what a 100 broadcom portfolio would have done over the past nine years 100 broadcom portfolio historical returns january 2010 to may 2019 source portfolio visualizer as you can see broadcom would have multiplied your money 16 fold over the past nine years making it one of the best performing stocks of the bull market however despite actually being far less volatile than the market most of the time beta 0 41 due to long stretches of flat returns the stock ultimately suffered larger peak declines than the s p 500 it even fell into a bear market which is why being overly concentrated in any one risk asset isn t advisable for pretty much anyone now let s look at what a 10 broadcom 90 vanguard dividend appreciation etf vig a proxy for a diversified dividend growth portfolio would have done 90 vig 10 avgo portfolio historical results source portfolio visualizer this representation of a well diversified broadcom heavy portfolio would have still significantly outperformed the market but suffered far smaller peak declines in fact the worst year s returns since 2010 was just 0 7 still it s important to remember that a 100 stock portfolio is not appropriate for most people especially retirees living on some version of the 4 rule if you have to sell some of your portfolios every year to pay the bills you need to own some cash bonds in order to avoid selling stocks at historically low levels during corrections bear markets invesco ultra short duration etf gsy a low cost cash equivalent etf vanguard total bond market etf bnd a low cost bond etf with exposure to purely investment grade corporate and government debt source portfolio visualizer here s an example of a well constructed portfolio for most people nearing retirement this 60 stock 40 bond portfolio has plenty of exposure to broadcom but not so much that you risk torpedoing your financial future should the company s thesis break even the bluest of blue chips can fail as ge investors can attest to here s how this more conservative income portfolio would have done with annual rebalancing against the vanguard balanced index fund vbiax a low cost 60 40 stock bond index etf 10 avgo 50 vig 10 cash 30 bond portfolio returns over time source portfolio visualizer this portfolio which is appropriate for most retirees managed to keep up with its benchmark the default 60 40 stock bond portfolio until 2014 when dividend stocks in general and broadcom in particular started to do especially well over the past decade it s managed to significantly outperform its benchmark generating returns above the s p 500 s historical 9 1 cagr all while generating a superior sharpe risk adjusted return and sortino reward risk ratios to the default portfolio option for conservative investors this is how my individual article recommendations are meant to be used as part of a well diversified holistic portfolio that includes the appropriate asset allocation into cash bonds for your individual risk tolerance goals feel free to substitute other etfs other than vig bnd or gsy since most low cost etfs track similar indexes and thus generate similar returns and if you want to limit individual stock holdings to 5 of your portfolio or invested capital that s also fine 5 of invested capital is my personal individual holding cap aimed to ensure that any inevitable mistakes i make won t blow up my portfolio because no less than peter lynch said in this business if you re good you re right six times out of ten source tipranks so far in three years on seeking alpha and nearly 500 recommendations 97 long recs i ve managed to keep ahead of that 60 good analyst benchmark but while i am confident that my 100 undervalued blue chip focus can keep me above 60 over time proper risk management portfolio construction is ultimately how you will achieve your long term financial goals and avoid the sad fate of the average retail investor over the past two decades according to jpmorgan asset management improper portfolio construction and horrible market timing is why the typical investor managed to underperform all asset classes and even historically mild inflation since 1998 in contrast even a 60 40 bond stock portfolio ultra conservative would have achieved about 2 5x times better returns all while allowing you to sleep well at night during bear markets bottom line for those who can see past short term trade war recession risk broadcom is a potentially great long term high yield dividend growth investment i m not a prophet and can t tell you when the us china trade war will end it s possible that things will get worse before they get better and that broadcom and other trade sensitive tech firms will crash a lot lower before this soap opera finally concludes what i can tell you is that broadcom is a very high quality industry leader a 10 11 swan stock on my quality score offers a safe 4 dividend and both management and analysts believe it s on track to achieve double digit fcf share and dividend growth over the long term that s driven by the company s strong competitive advantages in 5g components hock tan s proven brilliance at accretive m a and the larger focus on recurring software revenue that now makes up 22 of its total business as far as m a hungry chip makers go i consider broadcom to be the gold standard and for a company of this caliber growing at double digits even in 2019 s trying industry environment buying shares at an approximate 14 discount to fair value is a smart long term strategy just never forget that all of my recommendations are meant only for the stock portion of your portfolio with a 5 10 year time horizon even level 10 11 swan stocks can and will inevitably suffer steep short term declines such as 10 one day crashes as peter lynch famously said the key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them which is why proper diversification and asset allocation is crucial to being able to sleep well at night no matter what the price does in the short term and thus let this world class blue chip s management execute on its growth plan in the meantime anyone buying today will enjoy a generous safe and rapidly growing dividend while they patiently wait for the trade war to end

a recently published series of articles by the new york times has exposed the brutal exploitation of new york city taxi drivers due to predatory lending practices this compounded by growing competition from ride hailing services such as uber and lyft has led to extreme economic stress nearly a thousand bankruptcies and at least eight suicides by taxi limousine and ride hailing drivers last year alone much as with the housing mortgage bubble a decade ago banks and other private lenders used shady and deceptive practices to lure drivers into taking out enormous loans to purchase taxi medallions ownership of these city regulated medallions allows an individual to drive their own cab rather than work as an employee of corporate fleets which own large numbers of medallions and have long been known for corruption and the exploitation of drivers in earlier decades purchase of a medallion the value of which had historically grown at a modest rate was seen as a sound investment through hard work a driver could achieve a relatively decent standard of living in recent times however the introduction of predatory lending practices by a growing number of companies specializing in medallion loans targeting individual cabbies resulted in a boom and bust cycle which has devastated many of the city s largely immigrant taxi drivers this was compounded by an influx of other lenders seeking new investment opportunities after the 2008 crash drove them out of the real estate market some fleet owners intentionally bid up medallion prices in order to inflate the value of their own holdings among those who participated in such schemes was michael cohen president trump s former attorney he and his wife owned more than 30 medallions these practices greatly inflated the price of medallions creating a huge bubble which when it burst left individual drivers who had purchased the highly over valued medallions with unsustainable debt the times found that from 2002 to 2014 the price of a medallion increased by a factor of five from 200 000 to over 1 million over the same period taxi drivers incomes have been stagnant or declined new york taxi drivers on average saw a 10 000 reduction in their yearly earnings between 2013 and 2016 according to the new york taxi workers alliance as prices rose lenders encouraged borrowers to refinance based on the premise that the trend would continue upward forever much as with the pre 2008 housing bubble with no consideration of the borrower s underlying financial status many drivers now owe hundreds of thousands of dollars the city itself benefited financially from the inflated prices using the sale of new medallions as a revenue stream realizing upward of 855 million from sales and taxes under the administrations of mayor de blasio and his predecessor michael bloomberg a thousand new medallions were sold under bloomberg s administration at the same time government oversight of lending practices was loosened meanwhile reports raising warning flags were ignored as the wealthy profited the bubble burst in late 2014 in part under the increasing competitive pressure from ride hailing services uber launched in new york city in 2001 since then the price of medallions tumbled to below its 2002 level leaving the approximately 4 000 drivers who purchased them with mountainous debt and an enormously diminished asset nearly a thousand have so far declared bankruptcy and many more may soon follow this was in effect a ponzi scheme in which the lenders deliberately inflated prices they lured unsuspecting drivers many of them immigrants with limited english language skills with the prospect of being their own boss however victims were not warned of the debt trap they were entering according to the times the investigation found example after example of drivers trapped in exploitative loans including hundreds who signed interest only loans that required them to pay exorbitant fees forfeit their legal rights and give up almost all their monthly income indefinitely lenders snowed borrowers under with a blizzard of added charges rather than raising interest rates they made borrowers pay a mix of costs origination fees legal fees financing fees refinancing fees filing fees fees for paying too late and fees for paying too early according to a times review of more than 500 loans included in legal cases loans also included a balloon clause whereby the interest rate would increase to as high as 24 percent if the loan wasn t repaid in three years lenders profited at both ends first by sucking profits from drivers debt payments then as prices collapsed by purchasing hundreds of medallions at cut rate prices from bankrupt drivers while sending debt collectors to extract whatever other assets the drivers might have similar practices spread to cities across the country lenders have denied wrongdoing despite the striking similarities with the predatory practices that led to the financial crisis of 2008 and the city which regulates the taxi industry via its taxi and limousine commission also denies responsibility despite the fact that a 2010 study prepared for the city warned of the growing bubble the new york state attorney general recently launched an investigation into lending practices in the industry and the city has now announced its own inquiry little can be expected from such actions undertaken by agencies that allowed these practices to go on unhindered for years drivers for ride hailing services such as uber and lyft also suffer extreme exploitation as highlighted by the world wide strike in early may the strike was an international event with rideshare drivers participating in the united states australia great britain france nigeria kenya chile brazil panama costa rica uruguay and other countries emphasizing the shared experience of workers facing a common enemy uber is deliberately lowering driver earnings in order to maximize the projected stock windfall for investors the company announced a further 25 percent cut in driver compensation per mile last winter with uber now taking an average 33 percent in commission for each ride drivers in the us who are treated as independent contractors average a poverty wage of 10 to 12 per hour with few if any benefits one uber driver in new york city told the world socialist web site that he works 100 hours a week and averages less than 14 an hour in one of the most expensive cities in the world the similarity of conditions facing taxi livery and ride hailing drivers is illustrated by the note posted on facebook by doug schifter 61 a limousine driver who committed suicide last year i worked 100 120 consecutive hours almost every week for the past fourteen plus years when the industry started in 1981 i averaged 40 50 hours i cannot survive any longer with working 120 hours this is slavery now i don t know how else to try to make a difference other than a public display of a most private affair one cabbie roy kim 58 who hanged himself last november had bought a medallion the year before and was more than half a million dollars in debt an uber driver fausto luna also 58 who was deeply in debt committed suicide last october by throwing himself in front of a subway train reports indicate that uber has been collaborating with car dealers and financiers to push their drivers into purchasing vehicles under exorbitant terms similar to the predatory lending practices to which taxi drivers have been subject meanwhile the recent initial public offerings ipo of uber and lyft raised billions of dollars for each company the bursting of the medallion price bubble was due to a convergence of a number of factors the growth of ride hailing companies such as uber and lyft which have taken significant market share has been compounded by the city s significant increase in the sale of medallions putting more taxis on the street the result is the pitting of one section of the working class against another causing extreme economic and emotional stress under these conditions the unscrupulous lending policies which astronomically inflated the price of medallions were inevitably destined to cause a collapse just as with the housing bubble prices could not continue rising forever with devastating consequences for the working class just as in 2008 while the corporate gangsters will be rescued the big business politicians will do nothing to alleviate the suffering of the victims of these crimes the fight by transportation workers against these appalling conditions requires the building of new organizations independent of the pro corporate trade unions and the two parties of the wall street banks the democrats and republicans the rational reorganization of the transportation industry calls for a socialist program oriented to the interests of workers and the traveling public not the profiteering of the banks the author also recommends uber and lyft drivers conduct international strike eighth new york city taxi driver suicide of 2018
