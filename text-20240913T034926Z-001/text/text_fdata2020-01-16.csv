expand elise amendola ap photo after democrats swept into control of the house of representatives in the 2018 midterms something unusual happened almost no incoming freshmen sought a seat on the house financial services committee not only is the panel one of the most important and wide ranging in congress with jurisdiction over banking regulations the affordable housing crisis economic discrimination retirement security and the macro economy it s historically been a landing spot for swing state democrats looking for a fertile source of campaign fund raising from deep pocketed financiers yet the centrist democrats saw more peril than promise in accepting wall street donations this practically unprecedented situation created an opportunity for progressives who were unable to secure spots on other exclusive committees to jump onto financial services like superstar congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez but overseeing the financial sector is anything but a consolation prize as occupy wall street taught us the industry is right at the heart of why the economy no longer works for most americans after all it was only a decade ago that inattention to financial maneuvering led the economy to the brink of implosion as bankers took advantage of the opportunity to steal in the dark the results fell most harshly on the working poor and those struggling to improve their lot roughly 8 7 million jobs were lost in the great recession according to a wall street journal article in 2015 at least 9 3 million families lost their homes through either foreclosure or some other transaction that forced an eviction most of these borrowers committed nothing more than an accident of timing buying into a historic bubble and suffering tragic consequences the housing collapse robbed millions of families of home equity the primary method of building wealth in the united states particularly for families of color former representative brad miller has called the crisis an extinction event for the black and latinx middle class the great recession s wall street directed pain at the nation s most vulnerable is no anomaly for decades after the depression lenders redlined neighborhoods to keep families of color out barred from an avenue to gathering wealth when the fair housing act of 1968 and the community reinvestment act of 1977 attempted to right these wrongs and produce equitable access to the financial system for low and moderate income families the industry cooked up other schemes like subprime lending to wipe them out and even after the recession banks like wells fargo continue to use deceptive practices to nickel and dime low income customers and put them in peril wall street and predatory misconduct often go hand in hand timothy geithner then treasury secretary was fond of a simple dictum plan beats no plan he focused with laser sharp precision on preserving the financial system and policy makers to his left with vague alternatives could not compete as a result instead of transformative financial regulation we got the dodd frank act and while parts of it undoubtedly have merit such as the consumer financial protection bureau a long needed agency with its sole mission to protect people from financial rip offs for the most part it produced a complex series of technocratic tweaks with final rules left up to banking regulators to write after its passage the industry predictably sent a flotilla of lobbyists to weaken dodd frank and lock in the status quo even the consumer financial protection bureau couldn t prevent a committed opponent mick mulvaney from taking over during the trump administration enforcement slowed to a trickle geithner incidentally is now running a private equity firm that owns a company called mariner finance which profits off deceiving the working poor into high interest loans plan beats no plan for the emerging left answers are available for how to rein in the financial sector they just need to be given prominence at a time of climate devastation migrant abuses and soaring inequality it may seem boring and arcane to focus attention on loans and securities but control of money who has it who can manipulate it and who can deploy it at others expense must sit at the center of a left agenda expand gerald herbert ap photo president barack obama leaves a white house meeting with nec director lawrence summers representative barney frank senator christopher dodd treasury secretary tim geithner senator richard shelby and representative spencer bachus february 2009 what do we actually need a healthy financial system to do first it must manage payments so we don t have to carry wads of cash around to settle major transactions this used to mean checks and credit cards but today we have debit cards electronic fund transfers online bill pay e commerce solutions and even mobile payments second a good financial system matches those who want to lend money with those who want to borrow whether individuals or businesses we mostly think about this as a bank using savings deposits to finance lending that s not quite how it works as we ll get to later but peer to peer online services directly matching borrowers and lenders have also flourished more recently banks also manage investments for families and institutions and finally banks provide insurance both simple insurance against loss of savings by putting them in a government insured institution instead of under a mattress and more sophisticated insurance of major assets like home or auto or family well being in the event of a sudden loss of the breadwinner these functions are intended to enable investments in the real economy so productive businesses can grow and entrepreneurship can thrive as john kay the longtime financial times writer estimates in his book other people s money these elements again all that we actually need for a functional financial system make up only about 10 percent of total sector activity to a far greater degree financial institutions today trade assets package assets for trading and repackage those packaged assets for more trading trading desks have swamped more traditional banking operations in terms of growth and profit in short we built a financial sector and created a trading monster as a result wall street is several orders of magnitude larger than it should be in 2017 the financial sector took in 432 billion in profits just under 20 percent of total net corporate income federal reserve banks accounted for another 79 2 billion put that together and nearly 1 in 4 earned by corporations in 2017 came from financial sector activity if anything that s an undercount because it doesn t include parts of the nonfinancial economy where profits are conjured through financial activity incredible amounts of corporate profits are derived from accounting and tax strategies that have nothing to do with the core business apple may make iphones but it also manages a 244 billion investment firm called braeburn capital like many other fortune 500 companies that are laden with cash and deploying it in the capital markets dozens of retail restaurant and consumer product brands are pawns in a financial engineering contest waged by private equity firms a surprising chunk of activity on amazon is effectively arbitrage trading with upstarts securing assets they can buy low and sell high mergers and acquisitions which soared to record highs in 2018 can be seen as higher level trading of entire corporations with banks advising and taking cuts out of the deal overfinancialization creates multiple problems for an economy it increases systemic risk if the bankers bets go bad there s less of a real economy to fall back on it stifles efforts to build a more inclusive economy as access to financial markets determines fortunes nearly one third of all national income in the united states is derived from financial maneuvers like stock equity interest dividends and real estate this income is generated from having money and the financial sector facilitates this wealth built upon wealth no less than the radical socialists at the international monetary fund have demonstrated that a financial sector reaches a tipping point at a certain size where its continued development can actually damage growth the united states is currently on the wrong side of that line the dominance of trading lessens the importance of traditional banking especially in what bankers would call unprofitable communities over the past decade banks have dumped branches and created financial deserts across the country according to the federal deposit insurance corporation s most recent national survey more than one quarter of all american households have little or no access to financial services deprived of an essential component of participating in the modern economy a bloated banking sector supercharges inequality with the earnings of those allowed inside the wall street casino far outpacing those of ordinary workers that s true within the industry as well the largest six u s banks control 10 37 trillion in assets a figure that has only increased in market share after the financial crisis that may sound enormous but it s actually less than the 12 8 trillion lent spent and guaranteed by the u s government to save the financial system after the 2008 crash not only are lumbering banking behemoths too big to fail granted implicit guarantees by the government that they will be rescued in the event of disaster their sprawling operations are also too big to manage highlighted by complexity and confusion that gives bad actors leeway often deliberately so to engage in misconduct from assisting money laundering and tax evasion to rigging interest and foreign exchange rates banks have revealed themselves as unrepentant sinners who took taxpayer cash without strings and showed no interest in reforming their behaviors we cannot rely on silicon valley to get right what wall street has gotten wrong the economic power held on wall street routinely converts into political power the financial sector enjoyed some of the biggest benefits from the trump tax cuts an unprecedented 100 billion in earnings by the biggest six banks in 2018 efforts to get banks to divest from environmental calamities like the keystone xl pipeline private prison companies profiting from immigration cruelties or gun manufacturers driving america s mass shooting epidemic are in their way noble but also faintly pathetic as they accept as reality that banks have simply accumulated more power than democratic governance and that the only avenue to policy change lies in begging wall street executives to use their dominion over the country for good so how can we fix this it s simple we retain the parts of the banking system that are socially useful and necessary we ensure equitable access to those tools stepping in with nationalized solutions if the private sector cannot accomplish this and then we flay the rest and toss it into the sea step 1 breaking trading one provision in the dodd frank reform tried to do something about excessive trading the so called volcker rule intended to prevent banks that take deposits from using that money to make high risk trades sometimes this is known as proprietary trading but the prohibition relies on whether regulators can differentiate proprietary trading from the carve outs that bank lobbyists managed to force into the rule if a bank says it s hedging risk making a trade to offset potential losses on another trade or engaging in market making offering to buy and sell the same financial instrument so other investors have access to the trade it s exempt from the volcker rule and sharp bankers quickly learned how to characterize practically every trade in their portfolio as market making or hedging another exception enables banks to invest up to 3 percent of their capital in hedge funds and private equity firms effectively laundering trading through another channel successful lobbying for subsequent delays in implementation relieved banks from having to unwind most of their out of compliance trades until 2017 seven years after the volcker rule s passage so plenty of trading has continued and now the trump administration has begun the process of degrading the volcker rule even further by exempting more types of funds and shifting the burden of proof for compliance to regulators instead of the banks in other words an illegal trade isn t illegal until some agency official manages to figure it out even though regulatory budgets are a fraction of any established bank s and regulators cannot possibly track down noncompliant trades in real time we already have many of the tools needed to transform the financial system what we lack are regulators aggressive enough to use them under dodd frank firms that cannot credibly explain to regulators how they would be dismantled and sold off in a crisis can be forced to downsize or even break up the financial stability oversight council a board composed of major regulators also could declare that large firms must be busted up if they posed a systemic risk the federal reserve has already and can further increase capital requirements on the largest and riskiest firms in ways that could force them to pay for their own mistakes and induce them to downsize the justice department can jail executives who break the law or otherwise punish miscreant banks to create a deterrent against criminal behavior but to eliminate the risks of excessive trading regulators would need additional tools first we could structurally separate trading activities from traditional banking activities like taking deposits and making loans this is often called the glass steagall reform after the new deal era rule splitting investment and commercial banks this would reduce the interconnectedness that caused losses in housing securities to cascade throughout the financial system during the crisis it would also break up large supermarket banks that perform both commercial and investment banking activities like jpmorgan chase or citigroup and move them down the road of being small enough to fail without disrupting the economy such a rule would further establish that banks can receive government benefits like deposit insurance discounted federal reserve lending and expectations of future bailouts only if they engage in socially necessary activities we shouldn t want ordinary americans deposits entangled with and indeed funding what amounts to high stakes gambling a no transfer rule would prevent any money inside a narrow commercial bank from leaking out into the capital markets if an investment bank wants to trade it can do so on its own dime with fully disclosed risks and a prescribed duty to investors the concept of glass steagall style structural separation has been broadly accepted throughout developed economies the liikanen report produced in 2012 by a european union task force recommended ring fencing deposits so that they could not be jeopardized by failures in trading the vickers report in the united kingdom reached the same conclusion the radicals in this debate are protecting the deregulatory status quo the rest of the world has already made up its mind john kay takes this even further by recommending specialized institutions for handling asset management issuing securities and advising corporations his design would minimize conflicts of interest so the same firm isn t selling securities and advising companies on what securities to buy in kay s view glass steagall isn t enough to fragment the system you must broadly segment to ensure safety and break the tight coupling between different parts of finance he looks at the problem as an engineer would and redesigns the plumbing to ensure that the water keeps flowing regardless of an isolated failure depriving subsidies to trading institutions limits the amount of funds available to expand trading but there s also the option of simply banning socially unproductive trading entirely that would return finance to its role as a facilitator of economic output rather than the center of it step 2 deleting derivatives and spotlighting the shadow banks derivative trades are bets on whether a financial asset will go up or down in value regardless of whether either side of the trade owns that asset and they re everywhere the most recent statistics show an outstanding value of all derivatives contracts at 544 trillion with a t derivatives originated as commodity hedges so farmers would have some fallback in case their crops failed of course there are other ways to compensate farmers for assuming risk and noncommodity derivatives have poured money into financial markets for scant societal benefit that s particularly true of second order derivatives bets on top of bets repackaged for investors to trade during the financial crisis collateralized debt obligations derivatives based on the rise and fall of the housing market exposed the entire system to the bubble collapse thanks to collateralized debt obligations investors who didn t own the underlying mortgages still lost big when those mortgages failed big banks and their regulators sometimes argue that derivatives are merely a risk management tool but as we saw in the crisis when deployed in the real world derivatives increase financial risk by widening the amount of exposure from any single disaster across investors and firms if they just amount to bets in a casino close the casino a proposal from morgan ricks of vanderbilt university addresses short term funding markets a 20 trillion pool of overnight lending that finances an astounding amount of trading activity the financial part of the financial crisis occurred because lenders were worried they wouldn t be paid back on their short term debt overnight repurchases or money market accounts are considered as safe as money but the crisis demonstrated that they are potentially unstable and prone to runs banks have reduced reliance on this type of debt but there s still plenty of it floating around particularly outside the traditional banking sector as a cheap source of funding for so called shadow banks like hedge funds and private equity firms if only chartered banks could issue short term debt and if they were separated from other parts of the financial system those banks could be monitored for excessive lending reducing the likelihood of a debilitating crisis it would simplify the market structure by limiting the channel through which overnight lending could flow plus shadow banks would lose access to cheap capital this raises a bigger question why do hedge funds exist at all and do we need them a loophole in the investment company and investment advisers acts of 1940 allowed firms that cater to sophisticated investors at the time wealthy families to engage in risky profit making activities like short sales bets that a stock will go down instead of up leverage investing with borrowed funds to amplify returns and heighten risk and corporate takeovers policy makers justified this by reckoning that sophisticated investors can handle the risks while retail investors needed to be protected more stringently the exemption expanded in the national securities markets improvement act of 1996 to include institutional investors like pension funds and university endowments hedge fund assets subsequently increased twentyfold in twenty years this has perverted the entire point of the 1940 acts which was to break up giant pools of capital used for rank speculation now hedge fund capital and that of its close cousin the private equity fund has shoved itself into practically every aspect of economic life largely outside the purview of regulatory authorities most retail bankruptcies in the age of e commerce can be attributed to companies owned by private equity funds investment firms that load up companies with debt and extract profits hedge funds have been at the forefront of scooping up the discounted debt of struggling sovereigns like argentina or greece or puerto rico and forcing a repayment payday high frequency trading is more and more a province of hedge funds name a financial strategy that harms workers businesses and investors and there s sure to be a hedge fund or private equity firm behind it we don t have to permit that closing the loophole and placing hedge funds under the 1940 acts would mandate disclosure alter the industry s complex lucrative fee structures and eliminate the use of leverage in effect it would put these predatory actors out of business separating bank business lines by activities and banning harmful products changes the system we have from a complex interconnected agglomeration where a failure in one area can spill over everywhere to a more independent and stable system combining these ideas would reduce trading volumes and channel capital only toward necessary activity expand rick bowmer ap photo californians for community empowerment and others protest wells fargo s consumer lending and mortgage practices after bank shareholders salt lake city meeting april 2013 step 3 democratize our financial system but eliminating or segregating the nonessential aspects of banking is not sufficient to fix the system if separated from investment banking the firms controlling consumer banking will need to rely even more on fees and markups and deception to hit their profit targets we saw this with wells fargo a firm mostly engaged in consumer banking which issued millions of fake accounts to meet high sales goals that was just one of an avalanche of scandals for the bank most of which involved ripping off its own customers it placed unnecessary auto insurance on customer accounts secretly changed the loan terms of mortgage borrowers in bankruptcy and falsified records to charge mortgage applicants for its own delays in application processing to name but a few examples any bank committed to that much criminality to make its profits should have its corporate charter revoked but even a scrupulous commercial bank sector would be problematic for how much of the country it leaves out large banks claim that poor depositors whom they cannot also sell loans to or advise on investment cost them money on average it s worth questioning this assertion but if commercial banks are prohibited from engaging in other profit making activities it s likely that rates of unbanked and underbanked americans concentrated in poor communities and communities of color would increase traditional banking is one area where there s been an attempt at disruption so called fintech firms use the internet to deliver financial services this includes companies that let people make payments over the web or on their phones paypal stripe venmo websites that offer simple bank accounts without physical bank branches chime empower financial adviser robots that manage investments through an algorithm betterment and peer to peer consumer lending sites that match people with excess money to those who need it prosper lendingclub sofi users of these services praise their efficiency and ease of use and it s not like traditional banking has such a sterling reputation that it couldn t do with some competition but there s as much peril in fintech as there is promise like shadow banks lendingclub and sofi exist somewhere outside the regulatory perimeter unencumbered by laws that protect consumers state regulation could provide a backstop but federal banking regulators in the trump administration have trotted out a fintech banking charter which would strip state oversight and potentially allow these companies to engage in deceptive or discriminatory lending while federal authorities look the other way it s also more and more apparent that the ultimate lenders behind these shiny internet firms are the same old bankers and financiers who dominate this industry morgan stanley goldman sachs and blackrock have plowed money into peer to peer lenders and issued hundreds of millions of dollars in peer to peer loan backed securities this is not very different from how banks provided the capital for nonbank mortgage originators to make subprime loans during the financial crisis we cannot rely on silicon valley to get right what wall street has gotten wrong new laws to give fintech consumers the same protections as bank customers are sorely needed but even with those in place the divide between those with and those without a bank account could simply be replaced by a digital divide locking out lower income people in need of financial services plus if an algorithm determines creditworthiness as is the case with many fintech companies the same biases blocking people of color from loans can slip into the process in a far more bloodless fashion without stable access to financial services individuals are pushed to the fringes where predatory actors like check cashing stores pawnshops and payday lenders gouge them according to a 2014 white paper the average household using these alternative financial services spends 2 412 a year on interest and fees roughly 10 percent of their total gross income this is completely unacceptable and there s a solution lurking on nearly every main street in america from 1911 to 1967 the u s postal service gave millions of customers postal savings accounts and even today it sells money orders a secure certified check there are more than 31 000 post office locations one in every u s zip code 58 percent of their branches are in zip codes with zero or one bank by offering basic financial services an atm card an interest bearing savings account remittance services to friends and family abroad even potentially small loans the postal service can give millions a public option for simple banking fulfilling the agency s mission of providing all citizens access to commerce while saving them billions of dollars in unnecessary fees to sinister operators federal benefits could be automatically loaded into postal banking accounts and customers could seamlessly exchange payments inside the system if banks would rather not serve low income populations the postal service can more cheaply and equitably than the alternatives postal banking would instantly increase convenience and give the unbanked a risk free way to step into the modern economy it would give everyone a way to exchange money borrow when they need it and have their savings protected it could serve as the backbone of a consumer financial system acknowledging that banking services comprise an essential piece of u s infrastructure like a road or bridge but there are more ambitious options to democratize finance thomas herndon and mark paul in a 2018 report for the roosevelt institute envisioned a publicly administered online marketplace for financial services where the offerings of a postal bank and private banks could be compared side by side with a ratings system and consumer reviews this would incentivize competition on the price and quality of loans and other financial products and give the government a mechanism to police financial services through access to the marketplace postal banking would instantly increase convenience and give the unbanked a risk free way to step into the modern economy a more radical solution would be a public bank that does more than take deposits from individuals the bank of north dakota established in 1919 has only one depositor the state those deposits mostly tax revenues that have yet to be paid back out in salaries or services form the base from which the bank makes in state loans for economic development including infrastructure projects and a student loan program a public bank serves as a substitute not so much for private sector banks as for the 3 8 trillion municipal bond market when state or local governments fund large scale projects not covered by taxes they generally either borrow from the bond market at high interest rates or enter into a public private partnership with investors who often don t have community needs at heart and slap already beleaguered municipalities with outrageous underwriting fees a public bank can offer lower interest rates and fees because it s not a for profit business trying to maximize returns second because the bank is publicly owned any profit flows back to the city or state virtually eliminating financing costs and providing governments with extra revenue at no cost to taxpayers the bank of north dakota for example has earned record profits for fourteen straight years during both the great recession and the state s more recent downturn from the collapse in oil prices over the last decade hundreds of millions of dollars in bank earnings have been transferred to north dakota the objection that governments have no money to lend is spurious banks don t lend out their deposits but create new money by extending credit the deposits simply balance a bank s books public banks then expand the local money supply available for economic development public banking and democratized investment vehicles could reimagine the role of finance as more than just blind profit seeking a bank built to serve the public can channel its resources to actual public needs it can give the american people a defined voice in the direction of their money instead of being at the mercy of financiers they d be participating in a fundamentally democratic process if you put these ideas together you end up with something close to what academics morgan ricks lev menand and john crawford proposed in 2018 they call it the fedaccount the fedaccount would be a personal account for all individuals and businesses at the federal reserve the same as what financial institutions already have with the nation s central bank the fedaccount would supply debit cards direct deposit online bill pay and mobile banking and post offices could serve as the retail storefront location for the enterprise money that banks stash at the federal reserve earns the federal funds rate not the infinitesimal rates americans receive on their bank accounts banks instantly transfer funds to one another through their fedaccounts a privilege that would be opened up to the rest of us because businesses would also have fedaccounts that would curtail transaction fees for retailers and create a cheaper substitute for cash available to all and while personal bank accounts are only guaranteed through the fdic up to 250 000 fedaccounts can never default no matter how large the account balance because the federal reserve prints america s money this would obviously increase financial access and improve the payment system it would also eat away at the giant deposit bases of the big banks reducing their size and potentially their risk to the financial system but most important it would allow the fed to more directly influence economic policy rajiv sethi of barnard college has explained that profits from the fed s balance sheet and it earned 65 billion in 2018 could be directly transmitted to americans in times of recession to create an immediate fiscal boost the money would go directly to debtors to pay off their bills instead of creditors who benefit from changes to interest rates the fed s current policy tool because millions of people would have fedaccounts the fed s balance sheet would grow even larger with more profits to channel during economic downturns in other words the people s money would be put to work for the people and while the authors of the fedaccount proposal restricted the fed from direct consumer and business lending you could envision that being added on if you believe money is a public resource and not a privately supplied product government allocation of credit takes on the role of sensible distribution of resources the fedaccount could tie together all facets of a public bank built with the public s well being at the forefront a bank built to serve the public can channel its resources to actual public needs it can give the american people a defined voice in the direction of their money instead of being at the mercy of financiers they d be participating in a fundamentally democratic process americans are currently stuck with a decrepit payment system miscreant banks interest bearing bank accounts that bear no interest and a financial sector that s thoroughly unconcerned with their lives as they push past the public to trade their way to fortunes cryptocurrencies like bitcoin inspire such frenzy because people are looking for an alternative to a broken financial system the architecture for that alternative already exists it exists in regulators armed with the power to segregate functions and promote public safety it exists in enforcement agents who can identify risk and simply eliminate it for the public good it exists in federal agencies and central banks with missions to facilitate economic activity and prevent public suffering it also exists in our history layered with numerous triumphs by ordinary people over financial greed progressive era activists demanded and brought public banking to north dakota after the depression a young prosecutor named ferdinand pecora used a senate committee charged with studying the causes of the crisis to lay bare the rank corruption in the banking system leading to landmark new deal regulation that kept the country safe from runaway finance for fifty years activists reeling from reverend martin luther king s death fought for the fair housing act and an end to redlining the community reinvestment act of 1977 another grassroots initiative strengthened fair lending laws by requiring broad investment across low and moderate income communities the consumer financial protection bureau began as a proposal in a magazine by a harvard professor named elizabeth warren and thanks to popular support it became the only agency in the federal government with a core mission to prevent financial scams as wells fargo pursued its rapacious schemes a group of tellers and line level employees formed the committee for better banks to expose it which culminated in the resignation of ceo john stumpf in short we know how to fix finance we have a shelf full of ideas for this purpose and a demonstrated capacity to leverage people power to make them reality the only missing ingredient to accomplish this is the political will that a reinvigorated left can generate the progressive surge onto the house financial services committee provides an opportunity now activists and policy makers must work together not to squander it so finance is finally permanently put on a leash nothing could be more vital to rendering a more just and prosperous

account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday and thursday 11 12 december 2019 1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments mr cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting on 23 24 october 2019 there had been signs of increased optimism among market participants global bond yields had remained at some distance above the very low levels that had been observed towards the end of summer 2019 global stock prices were at or close to historical highs all in all financial market participants were less pessimistic and were pricing in less additional accommodation by central banks than earlier in the year global sovereign bond markets had been much quieter over the previous few weeks than they had been prior to the 23 24 october monetary policy meeting when prospects of a breakthrough in the trade negotiations between the united states and china had pushed up ten year us treasury and german government bond yields since then yields had moved broadly sideways with german ten year sovereign bond yields oscillating at around 30 basis points there were likely two main reasons why yields had not continued on an upward trajectory first the outlook remained less favourable than at the start of 2019 and there was still no breakthrough in the resolution of the two major risk factors currently facing the global economy i e the imposition of tariffs and brexit second monetary policy easing by major central banks including the ecb had put persistent downward pressure on yields since september 2019 expectations of a further easing of monetary policy in the euro area had undergone a reversal which had affected the entire forward interest rate curve there were currently only limited expectations of a further cut in the ecb s deposit facility rate over the following 12 months at the same time the prospect of a tightening had also remained far out in the future with a first full 10 basis point hike not priced in until the end of 2022 mr cœuré also provided an update on the progress and impact of the two tier system of reserve remuneration the share of banks unused allowances had dropped sharply after the implementation of the governing council s decision on the two tier system many banks had been fast to make full use of their allowances in part through cross border borrowing in money markets which was also reflected in trading volumes the impact on unsecured short term money market rates such as the str had been very limited the occasional spikes in str volatility were attributed to other factors unrelated to the two tier system at the same time there had been a notable initial increase in repurchase agreement market rates in some jurisdictions in response to the launch of the tiering system but it had not been persistent global equity prices had increased measurably as the prospects of a breakthrough in trade negotiations had improved the euro stoxx50 index had gone up by 2 since the governing council s monetary policy meeting on 23 24 october 2019 and the s p 500 by almost 5 hitting a new all time high at first sight stock and bond market developments seemed to be somewhat out of sync however stock markets were currently being driven by short term factors including the recent drop in risk aversion while earnings expectations suggested that both stock and bond market investors remained very cautious about the medium term growth and inflation outlook the near term global outlook had possibly been supported by the substantial easing of financial conditions in some emerging markets on the back of a reversal in portfolio flows since the start of 2019 investors had resumed channelling funds into emerging bond markets despite the ongoing trade tensions and broader uncertainty in financial markets the effective exchange rate of the euro had also continued to move broadly sideways reflecting among other things very limited movements against the us dollar the notable exception to these broadly stable exchange rate developments was the pound sterling which had risen by 9 since mid august 2019 when the risk of a no deal brexit had peaked the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr lane reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area regarding the external environment the pace of global activity had remained subdued the projected annual growth rate of global activity excluding the euro area stood at 2 9 in 2019 its lowest level since 2008 09 nonetheless there were signs of a stabilisation in the outlook for global gdp compared with the september 2019 ecb staff projections growth in global activity had been revised down though reflecting less dynamic activity in some emerging markets news regarding trade growth had been mixed while uncertainty remained elevated in some emerging economies there were tentative signs that growth was stabilising thanks in part to fiscal support however this reflected domestic activity in particular and did not necessarily imply an upward revision to imports risks to global trade hence also remained on the downside global financial conditions had eased moderately since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting in october in particular global equity prices had continued to rise on account of improved risk sentiment amid a retrenchment of safe haven flows oil prices had increased by 10 7 since the october meeting on the back of tighter oil supply following the opec extension of production cuts the euro had depreciated somewhat both against the us dollar and in nominal effective terms turning to the euro area in the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections real gdp growth was almost unrevised compared with the september 2019 ecb staff projections real gdp was expected to increase by 1 1 in 2020 1 4 in 2021 and 1 4 in 2022 the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remained tilted to the downside but had become somewhat less pronounced while the growth outlook remained muted in the near term a moderate recovery was expected later on reflecting the assumption of some dissipation of global headwinds which would allow the fundamentals supporting growth to regain traction since the last governing council meeting economic news as perceived by market participants had become less negative overall business surveys since mid september suggested a stabilisation in output growth at moderate rates the weakness in the manufacturing sector continued although the purchasing managers index pmi on euro area manufacturing output which had been in contraction territory since february 2019 recorded a slight rebound to 47 4 in november 2019 at the same time spillovers to the rest of the economy remained contained economic sentiment in the services sector albeit declining remained slightly above its long run average while construction retail trade and consumer confidence continued to stand clearly above their 1999 2019 averages private consumption continued to be supported by higher labour income which remained the main driver of real disposable income looking ahead real disposable income and private consumption growth were expected to remain solid albeit declining somewhat on account of weakening employment dynamics at the same time some near term moderation in housing investment was suggested by a range of indicators including residential investment construction confidence and building construction production business investment growth was expected to weaken further in the near term given the fall in industrial production and the rise in uncertainty about manufacturing activity which was contributing to investment being postponed as regards developments in euro area labour markets sectoral indicators pointed to a further moderation in labour market conditions largely driven by the manufacturing sector national accounts data for the third quarter showed that employment growth had declined to 0 1 in quarter on quarter terms from 0 2 in the second quarter of 2019 and from 0 3 in the first the pmi on employment had edged up in november to 51 8 remaining in contractionary territory for manufacturing and in expansionary territory for services and construction national accounts statistics confirmed persistent weakness in euro area exports of goods and services in the third quarter of 2019 extra euro area exports of goods had been stable as the negative contribution from asia was offset by the positive contribution from the united states while intra euro area trade had proved weaker especially in intermediate goods turning to price developments according to eurostat s flash estimate annual hicp inflation had increased from 0 7 in october to 1 0 in november mainly reflecting higher services and food price inflation hicp inflation excluding energy and food had increased from 1 1 in october to 1 3 in november measures of underlying inflation remained generally subdued although there were some indications of a mild increase which was in line with previous projections in the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections hicp inflation was projected to be 1 1 in 2020 1 4 in 2021 and 1 6 in 2022 reaching 1 7 at the end of the projection horizon projections for headline inflation as well as for hicp inflation excluding food and energy were broadly unrevised this reflected the interplay between on the one hand upward pressures from a weaker exchange rate and higher oil prices and on the other hand weaker global prices and staff taking a cautious view on domestic price dynamics in addition certain indicators of underlying inflation had also been heavily affected by statistical effects in package holiday prices in the euro area s largest economy some indicators that excluded this component suggested a very gradual but notable upward slope in the path of underlying inflation over recent years at the same time other measures showed a less convincing upward trajectory moreover as hicp inflation only partially reflected changes in housing related costs inflation measures would likely be higher currently if the cost of owner occupied housing was accounted for wage growth remained resilient but stronger labour cost pressures had been largely absorbed by profit margins annual growth in compensation per employee declined to 2 1 in the third quarter of 2019 down from 2 2 in the second quarter and 2 3 in the first although it remained close to its long term average 2 1 and substantially above its low of 1 1 in the second quarter of 2016 at the same time profit margin growth following its significant weakening in 2018 on account of the slowdown in economic activity had started to recover tentatively but remained negative in the third quarter of 2019 the recent slowdown in foreign and domestic demand had particularly affected activity in the industrial sector where unit profit growth was highly correlated with the business cycle and less so services activity for which the correlation tended to be somewhat lower average point estimates for longer term inflation expectations in the survey of professional forecasters had declined in each quarter of 2019 and stood at 1 67 in the fourth quarter of the year down from 1 88 in the final quarter of 2018 euro area market based indicators of medium to longer term inflation expectations had remained at low levels like other indicators the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead currently at 1 24 continued to hover somewhat above the all time low of 1 12 reached in early october 2019 turning to euro area financial conditions the eonia forward curve had shifted up further since the governing council s october monetary policy meeting reflecting generally favourable risk sentiment owing to promising trade talks between the united states and china and a tentative stabilisation of the macroeconomic outlook the forward curve now showed only a slight inversion with its trough slightly above 0 5 as term premia were now estimated to be close to zero up from previously negative levels genuine policy expectations had shifted by less than the forward curve suggested at the same time the estimated impact of the asset purchase programme app on the compression of term premia in ten year sovereign bonds remained sizeable euro area equity prices had increased further for non financial corporations since the october monetary policy meeting while they remained largely unchanged for financial corporations according to a dividend discount model the increase in euro area non financial equity prices was mainly driven by declines in the equity risk premium on the back of a perceived improvement in global risk sentiment this was dampened by the ongoing decline in longer term earnings expectations which however showed some signs of stabilisation turning to money and credit developments the annual growth rate of broad money m3 stood at 5 6 in october this was almost entirely driven by annual m1 growth with the decreasing opportunity cost of holding monetary assets being the main factor supporting robust broad money growth from a counterpart perspective credit to the private sector accounted for only about half of broad money creation while net external monetary flows accounted for the other half lending volumes continued to grow at a solid pace the annual growth of bank loans to non financial corporations was slightly below 4 in october while that in credit to households reached 3 5 in october with some differences across countries the ecb s monetary policy measures continued to be passed through to bank lending rates at the euro area level the composite lending rate for non financial corporations stabilised at 1 56 in october while the cost of borrowing for households for house purchase stood at the historical low of 1 44 while a large part of banks deposit funding in particular retail deposits remained floored at zero the distribution of deposit rates to non financial corporations continued to shift into negative territory in october 2019 at the same time margin pressure was offset by the favourable developments in bank bond yields despite recent increases moreover while the net interest income earned by banks for each unit of their assets had been compressed robust growth in intermediation volumes meant that the base for income generation was expanding in addition the two tier reserve system was expected to reduce the cost for banks of holding excess liquidity the euro area fiscal stance was assessed as being expansionary over 2019 21 which would provide some support to demand conditions and broadly neutral in 2022 the composition of fiscal expansion was tilted towards direct tax cuts and higher transfers at the euro area level the reduction in interest payments was estimated to offset around half of the budget effect of fiscal loosening monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr lane remarked that incoming data since the last monetary policy meeting pointed to continued weak but stabilising euro area growth dynamics the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties in combination with sector specific domestic factors continued to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and was dampening investment private consumption remained resilient amid rising wages and favourable albeit moderating labour market developments the december staff projections foresaw an increase in real gdp growth from 1 1 in 2020 which was a slight downward revision to 1 4 in both 2021 and 2022 although risks to the growth outlook remained tilted to the downside due to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets these risks had become somewhat less pronounced bank lending conditions for firms and households had continued to improve in a sign of continuing strong pass through of monetary policy in addition equity prices had increased in line with improved market sentiment and the euro exchange rate had depreciated somewhat measures of underlying inflation remained generally subdued although there were some indications of a mild increase which was in line with previous projections indicators of both market based and survey based inflation expectations had remained at or near historical lows solid and broad based wage growth was expected to continue and the profile of a gradual pick up in inflation remained largely unchanged compared with the september 2019 ecb staff projections the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections foresaw inflation increasing from an average of 1 2 in 2019 to an average of 1 6 in 2022 reaching 1 7 at the end of the projection horizon overall the governing council was still faced with an inflation outlook that was below its medium term aim and inflation expectations continued to stand at low levels significant action had been taken to support the rise of inflation towards the medium term aim the governing council would therefore closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy its strengthened forward guidance would ensure that financial conditions adjusted in line with changes to the inflation outlook against this background mr lane proposed to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged at today s meeting this would entail reiterating the forward guidance on policy interest rates net asset purchases and reinvestments at the same time in its communication the governing council needed to stress that it stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards the aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry 2 governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis governing council members broadly agreed with the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr lane in his introduction incoming information since the governing council s monetary policy meeting in october pointed to continued weak euro area growth dynamics although there were some signs of stabilisation the ongoing weakness of international trade amid persistent global uncertainties continued to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and was dampening investment growth at the same time the services and construction sectors had remained resilient despite some recent moderation with employment growth and increasing wages continuing to underpin the euro area economy this outlook was broadly reflected in the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections the outlook for real gdp growth had been revised down slightly for 2020 compared with the september 2019 ecb staff projections regarding the outlook for the external environment it was noted that the global outlook remained weak with a further downward revision to the outlook for both global growth and trade in the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections this was illustrated by the fact that the latest projections now foresaw growth in global trade excluding the euro area of below 1 in 2020 compared with an increase of over 2 in the september 2019 ecb staff projections members assessed the risks to the external environment as having remained on the downside overall due to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets with reference being made to the persistence of uncertainties related to trade tensions and to the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the eu at the same time it was suggested that sentiment in the united states seemed to have become more upbeat recently following indications that trade tensions between the united states and china were diminishing positive developments in financial markets perhaps reflected the view that an escalation of trade disputes in the coming year had become less likely however it was also argued that the global geopolitical situation was not conducive to lowering uncertainty at least in the short term with reference also being made to developments at the world trade organisation that could impair its functioning for some time concern about the risks to trade was also linked to the very complex nature of global supply chains it was emphasised that policies to rebuild confidence and reduce uncertainty were needed in relation to geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts turning to euro area activity members broadly agreed that recent economic data and survey information while remaining weak overall had also contained some more positive signs pointing to a stabilisation in euro area growth real gdp growth had been confirmed to have increased by 0 2 quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2019 unchanged from the previous quarter in the euro area s largest economy and in the euro area as a whole real activity had been stronger than expected in the third quarter in addition to some positive developments in recent survey data the citigroup surprise index was trending upwards and had been close to achieving positive values in recent weeks while according to various models estimates of the probability of recession had declined significantly with regard to the risk of adverse spillovers from the ongoing weakness in manufacturing to sentiment and activity in other sectors of the economy there appeared to be tentative indications that industrial production might bottom out before these spillovers became more generalised at the same time even though services sector activity had so far been resilient it was argued that there was a need to remain cautious given the risk of spillovers across countries in discussing the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections it was highlighted that this was the first projection exercise for some time in which there had not been a significant downward revision to the euro area growth outlook these projections could be interpreted as confirming the narrative contained in the previous projection exercise and increasing the governing council s confidence in the baseline at the same time it was acknowledged that the downward revision to foreign demand over the projection horizon had been offset by the prospect of stronger domestic demand which had benefited from the additional monetary policy accommodation introduced in september as well as some extra fiscal stimulus it was emphasised that the comprehensive package of policy measures that the governing council had decided in september was supporting the euro area expansion the ongoing build up of domestic price pressures and thus the robust convergence of inflation to its medium term aim however it was also stressed that in order to reap the full benefits from the ecb s monetary policy measures other policy areas needed to contribute decisively to raising the longer term growth potential supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets were assessed as remaining tilted to the downside but having become somewhat less pronounced regarding fiscal policy the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance in 2020 was seen as providing some support to economic activity however in view of the weak economic outlook members welcomed the eurogroup s call for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate it was emphasised that governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner while governments in countries where public debt was high needed to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets this would create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely also all countries should redouble their efforts to achieve a more growth friendly composition of public finances with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr lane in his introduction according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation had been 1 0 in november 2019 compared with 0 7 in october mainly reflecting higher services and food price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to rise somewhat in the coming months although measures of underlying inflation had generally remained muted there were indications of a mild increase in line with previous expectations while labour cost pressures had strengthened due to tighter labour markets the weaker growth momentum was delaying their pass through to inflation over the medium term inflation was expected to increase supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth this assessment was also broadly reflected in the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections compared with the september 2019 ecb staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised up slightly for 2020 and down slightly for 2021 mainly driven by the expected future path of energy prices in discussing the inflation outlook in the december 2019 eurosystem staff projections members acknowledged the absence of major revisions and considered that the latest projections provided broad confirmation of the path for inflation in the previous projections exercise it was noted that excluding volatile package holiday prices in the euro area s largest economy there had been a solid upward movement in underlying inflation supported by high capacity utilisation levels rising energy commodity prices and tight labour markets it was also observed that staff had adopted a more cautious approach to developments in profit margins over the projection horizon which were now assumed to recover more gradually while the impact of the ecb s monetary policy measures on growth and inflation contained in the december 2019 staff projections was seen as being rather conservative compared with a range of estimates from different models members also noted however that even though the latest inflation projections had not been revised down further there had previously been substantial downward revisions to the inflation outlook over the past year hicp inflation in 2021 was expected to be only 1 4 in the current projection exercise compared with 1 8 in the december 2018 staff projections moreover the comment was made that previous forecast errors for inflation were not fully explained by domestic and international factors and it was suggested that further efforts should be made to try to better understand the reasons behind the unexplained weakness in inflation regarding the impact of the cost of owner occupied housing on inflation measures it was pointed out that while the effect of including this factor was generally procyclical and increased the volatility of inflation it could also help to explain the perception of higher inflation in some countries where housing market developments had been relatively strong there was also some discussion about how climate related policies including the european commission s green deal package should be taken into account in the projection exercises with members contending that there was a need to step up efforts to understand the economic consequences of climate change it was highlighted that while policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change could be expected to have an impact on growth and inflation in the coming years the implications for the projections would need to be analysed carefully in particular it was argued that while such policies could be considered a negative supply shock the response to climate change could also lead to significantly higher investment while the impact on oil and energy prices was uncertain as regards longer term inflation expectations members noted that while market based measures of longer term expectations had stabilised the ecb s september monetary policy measures had not yet had any visible positive effect with longer term inflation expectations continuing to stand at historically low levels and clearly below the ecb s inflation aim in terms of market based measures of longer term inflation expectations the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1 24 while in terms of survey based measures longer term inflation expectations stood at 1 7 for the fourth quarter of 2019 in the survey of professional forecasters spf however it was pointed out that most of the gap between survey based and market based measures of longer term inflation expectations disappeared when adjusting for estimates of liquidity and risk premia and that the risk of deflation was low moreover a remark was made that the point estimates provided by spf participants were still at levels consistent with the governing council s inflation aim and that according to most available indicators the degree to which longer term inflation expectations were anchored had remained unchanged recently at the same time the previous declines in many of the indicators suggested close monitoring was warranted with regard to the monetary analysis members broadly shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction that money and credit developments remained robust overall the sustained rates of broad money growth reflected ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding m3 continued robust growth of money was also seen as evidence for the ongoing transmission of monetary policy given that the monetary aggregates had continued to expand despite the pause in net asset purchases between the beginning of the year and their resumption on 1 november the solid growth of loans to firms and households had benefited from the continued improvement in bank lending conditions which was seen as a sign of the ongoing pass through of the accommodative monetary policy stance to the borrowing conditions for the real economy the accommodative monetary policy stance was seen as safeguarding very favourable bank lending conditions and as continuing to support access to financing across all economic sectors the bank lending channel of monetary policy was seen to be functioning well as also evidenced by the euro area bank lending survey and the continued translation of favourable market funding conditions into easier borrowing conditions for firms and households at the same time some cross country heterogeneity in the pass through to lending rates was visible as competitive pressures in the banking industry differed across countries similarly it was noted that the extent to which banks were passing on the ecb s monetary policy to bank deposit rates varied considerably this was seen to be due to differences in legal frameworks market practices funding needs and competitive pressures across the banking systems of euro area countries moreover the potential financial stability implications of the current monetary policy environment were seen to merit close monitoring monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr lane in his introduction the incoming data since the last governing council meeting in late october pointed to continued weakness in euro area growth dynamics although there were some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown inflation developments had remained subdued overall although there were some indications of a slight increase in measures of underlying inflation in line with previous expectations members expressed confidence that the monetary policy measures would provide the necessary monetary stimulus to support the stabilisation of economic growth compensating to a large degree for the negative impulse from global factors and the recovery of inflation towards the governing council s aim the september monetary policy measures had contributed to an overall substantial easing in financial conditions preserving much of the easing that had occurred via anticipation effects since the summer perceptions of receding uncertainties mainly related to the trade dispute between the united states and china had led to some upward movement in risk free interest rates and yields in the corporate and sovereign bond markets since the october monetary policy meeting the more positive market sentiment had also supported equity prices and the euro had depreciated somewhat the point was made that the upward adjustment in the yield curve observed since september showed that markets were responding to changes in the data outlook and risks in line with the governing council s state dependent forward guidance this ran counter to perceptions of circularity between market expectations and the ecb s policy decisions at the same time it was highlighted that real interest rates remained at very low levels across the entire maturity spectrum which was seen as confirmation of the effectiveness of the ecb s policy measures in underpinning very favourable financing conditions the continued pass through of the monetary accommodation to improving loan dynamics and lower bank lending rates was also underlined this was providing support to firms and households for financing consumption and investment it was remarked that the introduction of the two tier system for reserve remuneration had proceeded very smoothly and had worked as intended it had relieved banks from part of their costs of holding excess liquidity while at the same time preserving money market rates at low levels it had also encouraged additional borrowing and lending activity in the money market including cross border trades which had led to a more homogenous distribution of liquidity across countries as also evidenced in the decline in target2 balances at the same time it was pointed out that the tiering induced cross border trading had been almost entirely based on secured money market transactions while unsecured transactions had remained largely domestic this suggested that the euro area money market continued to display some degree of fragmentation while it appeared that the take up in the operation under way as part of the new series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii would turn out to be somewhat lower than expected it was seen as contributing to preserving favourable bank lending conditions this lower take up was attributed to banks desire to minimise exposures towards the year end and the better distribution of liquidity through money markets as a result of the tiering system for reserve remuneration it was cautioned that the take up in the present operation should not be over interpreted but be assessed together with the take up in future operations and that the overall success of tltro iii should only be judged at the end of the programme against this background members widely agreed with the proposal by mr lane to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged with a steady hand being warranted for monetary policy this would entail reiterating the governing council s forward guidance on policy interest rates net asset purchases and reinvestments of principal payments the present monetary policy stimulus appeared fully appropriate lending substantial support to growth and inflation developments while vigilance on the efficacy of the policy measures and the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance was called for it was highlighted that the measures should be given time to exert their full impact on the euro area economy faced with a subdued inflation outlook which was largely unchanged from september members reiterated the need for a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time projected inflation was generally seen to remain some distance from the governing council s inflation aim while market based measures of inflation expectations had stagnated at historically low levels and downside risks to the growth outlook continued to prevail despite having become somewhat less pronounced in this environment monetary policy needed to remain highly expansionary members highlighted the crucial role of the governing council s forward guidance in providing monetary accommodation with the strengthened state based forward guidance decided at the september monetary policy meeting being seen as providing a degree of automatic stabilisation in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions tying the likely path of policy interest rates more clearly to inflation prospects ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with the evolving state of the economy and the outlook for inflation looking ahead there was broad agreement on the need to carefully monitor the incoming data and the evolution of risks while continuing to evaluate the pass through of the september policy measures in any case it remained vital for the governing council to be prepared to act by adjusting all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moved towards the aim in a sustained manner in line with the governing council s commitment to symmetry at the same time some members highlighted the need to be attentive to the possible side effects of the present monetary policy measures which merited close monitoring in the period ahead it was suggested that the liquidity created by the eurosystem needed to be tracked carefully regarding its impact on bank intermediation and asset markets namely equities housing and real estate as well as capital outflows outside europe in a search for yield some concern was also voiced with regard to the potential impact of negative interest rates on euro area households with savings and consumption dynamics also requiring close monitoring nonetheless confidence was expressed that policy rates had not yet reached the so called reversal rate thus far there was ample evidence that credit conditions in the euro area had continued to improve with rising credit volumes and declining borrowing rates for firms and households providing support to their consumption and investment plans moreover while the negative interest rate environment was dampening banks net interest income the overall effects on bank profitability had remained positive this related in particular to capital gains from banks sales of securities to the eurosystem and lower provisions for loan impairment with the overall macroeconomic environment having improved in part as a consequence of the accommodative monetary policy stance in this context it was recalled that macroprudential policies were the first line of defence for addressing risks and side effects as they could be tailored to the issues identified to some extent the implementation of monetary policy could also be adjusted to reduce unwanted side effects with the introduction of the two tier system for excess reserve remuneration being seen as a case in point on communication members broadly agreed with the proposals put forward by mr lane in his introduction it needed to be emphasised that overall the incoming data remained weak but had signalled some stabilisation of the euro area economy it had to be pointed out that risks remained tilted to the downside although they had become somewhat less pronounced with regard to monetary policy the need for patience and perseverance needed to be stressed on the one hand it needed to be highlighted that the measures decided in september had been effective and were reaching the economy although more time was needed for their full effects on economic outcomes to unfold on the other hand it needed to be emphasised that the baseline scenario for growth and inflation continued to be predicated on a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time therefore steady handed communication was needed in order to preserve the very favourable financial conditions to support a robust convergence of inflation towards the governing council s inflation aim likewise it was felt that the governing council needed to reiterate its commitment to achieving its inflation aim in this regard the important role of the governing council s state dependent forward guidance needed to be highlighted as it might not have been fully appreciated by market participants and ecb observers it needed to be stressed that the forward guidance formulation by tightly linking the likely future path of policy rates to an inflation outlook that was sufficiently close to but below 2 as well as a consistent rise in observed underlying inflation ensured that financial conditions would adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook at the same time it was seen as important to stress that the governing council was attentive to potential side effects of its monetary policy measures while the present monetary policy configuration was fully appropriate it needed to be emphasised that the analysis and monitoring of side effects was part and parcel of the governing council s ongoing monetary policy assessment furthermore it was necessary to reiterate that other policymakers needed to contribute more decisively to supporting the euro area economy contributing to further stabilisation and building confidence as well as alleviating uncertainties relating to trade and geopolitical tensions that were holding back a more dynamic expansion of the economy in particular fiscal policy notably that of governments with fiscal space had to play a more prominent role in stabilising economic conditions in view of the weakened economic outlook in this context the governing council welcomed the eurogroup s recent call for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate finally it was also suggested that some broad guidance be communicated about the forthcoming strategy review including the likely timeline although it was generally seen as advisable to refrain from public discussions on the strategy prior to the envisaged launch of the review by the governing council early in 2020 monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members upon a proposal by the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 50 respectively the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it saw the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 within its projection horizon and such convergence had been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics on 1 november net purchases had been restarted under the governing council s asset purchase programme app at a monthly pace of 20 billion the governing council expected them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates and to end shortly before it started raising the key ecb interest rates the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the introductory statement which the president and the vice president would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting introductory statement press release meeting of the ecb s

will offer new forecasts china s lending figures showed bank lending slowed in december while the shadow banking lending rose bank loan growth eased to cny1 14 trillion from cny1 39 trillion aggregate financing quicken to cny2 1 trillion from cny1 75 trillion the difference between the two is a useful proxy for shadow banking activity the average aggregate financing in 2019 rose to cny2 13 trillion from cny1 87 trillion in 2018 given the debt led growth reliance in china better lending figures seem consistent with the stabilization of the economy the dollar has been confined to about a 10 tick

from the monetary stimulus the pboc cut reserve requirement to start the year and the new benchmark the loan prime rate is expected to slip lower when it is set in a few days europe the ecb meets next week and the new strategic review how to measure and implement price stability target appears to be the key focus will be fleshed out the record from lagarde s first meeting will be reported shortly going forward we expect the record to change more in line with the practices of other central banks room for dissents will remove the perceived need for those that lose debates to take the case to the press the strategic retreat by french president macron on boosting the age to draw on full retirement benefits does not appear to be enough to appease the critics labor unions are organizing for widespread demonstrations at the end of next week the short end of the uk curve is stabilizing after investors upgraded the chances of a rate following recent official comments the june short sterling futures implied no change at 75 bp as recently as a week ago it reached 54 bp earlier today a marginal new low before steadying some caution may indeed be in order ahead of tomorrow s december retail sales report which is expected to show uk consumers returned to the shops after declining by 0 6 in november with and without petrol although turkey s inflation rose to 11 84 in december from 10 56 in november the central bank appears to be under political pressure to cut rates today from 12 one week repo rate it delivered a 75 bp rate cut to 11 25 leaving aside the loss of central bank independence a cut will bring the real rate inflation adjusted below zero the risk is a vicious cycle where rates do not fully compensate for the inflation and other risks weakening the currency over time and fanning price pressures in contrast south africa s inflation was 3 6 in november and the december reading out next week is expected to see an uptick through 4 the average repo rate stands at 6 5 and the central bank is expected to stand pat today the euro is in about a 10 tick range on both sides of 1 1155 and in the middle of the range seen in the first half of january there are a little more than two billion euros in options struck between 1 1100 and 1 1110 that expire today and more tomorrow if the downside looks protected the upside seems capped in the 1 1180 1 1200 area sterling is firm near the week s highs 1 3065 the euro has met offers in the gbp0 8600 area which coupled with the softer dollar tone maybe offering sterling some support nearby resistance against the dollar is seen in the 1 3080 1 3100 the political changes in russia do not seem to change the underlying status quo and putin s ability to dominate russian yields are a couple basis point lower and the rouble has been under a bit of pressure since recording roughly 18 month highs at the start of the week america it is striking that most of the initial assessments of the new us china trade agreement seemed to be critical for not going far enough some argued it is not as ironclad as the administration suggests others were disappointed that the currency section was not more robust it does not seem to go beyond the g20 and imf commitments and mostly have been met reserves trade and the financial account are reported in a timely fashion many economists and observers including the imf do not think that china has been manipulating the yuan to gain a competitive edge direct intervention in the foreign exchange market has been virtually non existent also china has made recent moves to strengthen intellectual property rights and is opening more of its financial sector to foreign investors there is some concern that with boeing s woes long term contracts in natural gas export controls may be used as a loophole it is possible and maybe even likely that while the us bilateral deficit with china narrows it grows with the rest of the world at the same time there is an innovation or a

notable exceptions europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is firm new record highs set last week us equities are edging higher in europe benchmark bond yields are little changed european yields are a little lower while the us 10 year is steady around 1 78 uk short term rates are steadying after their recent drop as the market discounts a greater chance of a cut later this month the dollar is trading lower against the major currencies but the japanese yen in quiet turnover emerging market currencies are mostly lower ahead though the yuan recouped yesterday s decline the market awaits the south african expect steady policy and turkey s 75 bp rate cut was anticipated gold is paring yesterday s gains and the decline in us oil inventories may be lending crude some support asia pacific japan s sales tax increase distorts some high frequency data it impacts economic activity as it was brought forward the tax increase also affects prices both of these were seen in today s data core machine tool orders jumped 18 in november around six times greater than expected after a 6 drop in october this is seen as a good indicator that capex will bounce back quickly separately producer prices rose 0 1 in december but 0 9 year over year recall there were negative year over year readings from june through october 2019 the boj meets next week although policy is unlikely to change the central bank will offer new forecasts china s lending figures showed bank lending slowed in december while the shadow banking lending rose bank loan growth eased to cny1 14 trillion from cny1 39 trillion aggregate financing quicken to cny2 1 trillion from cny1 75 trillion the difference between the two is a useful proxy for shadow banking activity the average aggregate financing in 2019 rose to cny2 13 trillion from cny1 87 trillion in 2018 given the debt led growth reliance in china better lending figures seem consistent with the stabilization of the economy the dollar has been confined to about a 10 tick range on either side of jpy109 95 recall tuesday s high was near jpy110 20 there is an option for 1 8 bln at jpy110 that expires today near term direction cues may come from other capital markets the side of the risk on mode that weighs on the yen is helping support the australian dollar which is testing the upper end of its recent range near 0 6920 above there resistance is seen in the 0 6940 0 6960 area the chinese yuan remains firm though it is below the high set earlier this week that saw the dollar trade near cny6 8670 the continued firmness of the yuan seems to go against the impulses from the monetary stimulus the pboc cut reserve requirement to start the year and the new benchmark the loan prime rate is expected to slip lower when it is set in a few days europe the ecb meets next week and the new strategic review how to measure and implement price stability target appears to be the key focus will be fleshed out the record from lagarde s first meeting will be reported shortly going forward we expect the record to change more in line with the practices of other central banks room for dissents will remove the perceived need for those that lose debates to take the case to the press the strategic retreat by french president macron on boosting the age to draw on full retirement benefits does not appear to be enough to appease the critics labor unions are organizing for widespread demonstrations at the end of next week the short end of the uk curve is stabilizing after investors upgraded the chances of a rate following recent official comments the june short sterling futures implied no change at 75 bp as recently as a week ago it reached 54 bp earlier today a marginal new low before steadying some caution may indeed be in order ahead of tomorrow s december retail sales report which is expected to show uk consumers returned to the shops after declining by 0 6 in november with and without petrol although turkey s inflation rose to 11 84 in december from 10 56 in november the central bank appears to be under political pressure to cut rates today from 12 one week repo rate it delivered a 75 bp rate cut to 11 25 leaving aside the loss of central bank independence a cut will bring the real rate inflation adjusted below zero the risk is a vicious cycle where rates do not fully compensate for the inflation and other risks weakening the currency over time and fanning price pressures in contrast south africa s inflation was 3 6 in november and the december reading out next week is expected to see an uptick through 4 the average repo rate stands at 6 5 and the central bank is expected to stand pat today the euro is in about a 10 tick range on both sides of 1 1155 and in the middle of the range seen in the first half of january there are a little more than two billion euros in options struck between 1 1100 and 1 1110 that expire today and more tomorrow if the downside looks protected the upside seems capped in the 1 1180 1 1200 area sterling is firm near the week s highs 1 3065 the euro has met offers in the gbp0 8600 area which coupled with the softer dollar tone maybe offering sterling some support nearby resistance against the dollar is seen in the 1 3080 1 3100 the political changes in russia do not seem to change the underlying status quo and putin s ability to dominate russian yields are a couple basis point lower and the rouble has been under a bit of pressure since recording roughly 18 month highs at the start of the week america it is striking that most of the initial assessments of the new us china trade agreement seemed to be critical for not going far enough some argued it is not as ironclad as the administration suggests others were disappointed that the currency section was not more robust it does not seem to go beyond the g20 and imf commitments and mostly have been met reserves trade and the financial account are reported in a timely fashion many economists and observers including the imf do not think that china has been manipulating the yuan to gain a competitive edge direct intervention in the foreign exchange market has been virtually non existent also china has made recent moves to strengthen intellectual property rights and is opening more of its financial sector to foreign investors there is some concern that with boeing s woes long term contracts in natural gas export controls may be used as a loophole it is possible and maybe even likely that while the us bilateral deficit with china narrows it grows with the rest of the world at the same time there is an innovation or a

adjust share day one the course of true nationalism never did run smooth â ernest gellner the city was not beautiful no one made that claim for it at the height of summer people in suits shellacked by the sun moved like harassed insects to avoid the concentrated light there was a civil warâ like fracture in americaâ the president had said soâ but little of it showed in the capital everyone was polite and smooth in their exchanges the corridor between dupont circle and georgetown was like the dream of yugoslav planners long blocks of uniform earth toned buildings that made the classical edifices of the hill seem the residue of ancestors straining for pedigree bunting starched and perfectly ruffled in red white and blue fans hung everywhereâ from air conditioners from gutters from statues of dead revolutionaries coming from berlin where the manual laborers are white i felt as though i was entering the heart of a caste civilization untouchables in hard hats drilled into sidewalks carried pylons and ate lunch from metal boxes while waiters in restaurants complimented old respectable bobbing heads on how well they were progressing with their rib eyes and iceberg wedges i had come to washington to witness either the birth of an ideology or what may turn out to be the passing of a kidney stone through the republican party there was a new movement afoot national conservatives they called themselves and they were gathering here at the ritz carlton at 22nd street and m disparate tribes had posted up for the potlatch reformacons blood and soilers curious liberal nationalists â austrians â repentant neocons evangelical christians corporate raiders cattle ranchers silicon valley dissidents buckleyites straussians orthodox jews catholics mormons tories dark web spiders tradcons lone conservatives fed socs young republicans reaganites in amber most straddled more than one category they were here because of one undeniable fact donald trump was going to die trump might be ejected from office or lose the election or win the electionâ but he was also definitely going to die and trumpism needed to survive it was just getting started if trumpism were snuffed out with trump republicans would fall back into march with the party lemmings in hock to their donors hardly any republican voters agreed with the donors about anything as trump had intuited who would connive with liberals to contaminate the country with more immigration more big tech treason more â freeâ trade more endless wars more slouching toward nihilism the ancien rã gime was threatening to reconstitute itself someone had to stand up for trumpism in the noble abstract someone philosophical who knew how to extract timelessness from the tawdriness trump the man might be crude and venal but trump the spirit had opened a trapdoor in history some political theological exegesis would be required to unspool the nature of the accomplishment the old world of the cold war and the american empire was over an older world of nationsâ a community of nations a brotherhood â was struggling to be reborn orbã n bolsanaro bibi borisâ all were wise to it while liberal professors sat on panels about â hungaryâ s wrong turnâ or â israelâ s self implosionâ or â the brexit backwash â as if history were a hedgerow only they were privileged to prune had they no eyes china was about to decide whether it preferred curtailing its exports or eating grass germany was primed to be pastoralized at last once detroit patented the right car battery it was house hunting season in the west bankâ did you know a good broker american industry was at a halftime pause waiting for clint eastwoodâ s voice over to resume was there room at guantã namo for the executive board of google the drugs needed to flow back outâ a new opium war â and the jobs needed to flow back inâ full employment a few good natcons could keep the republican zombie archy at bay fox news might well fall into conniptions at the notion but what was needed was â class warfareâ â or perhaps more precisely a war within the elitesâ to ensure that the future remained trumpian and did not revert to the globalist highway to nowhere â iâ m from the lesbian armpit of australia â said a buoyant young blond man fresh off the plane from his woke infected hometown of melbourne we were thick in the melee of the hotelâ s bowels people were collecting their national conservatism folders and pens adjusting their name tags lounging in plush chairs and couches were all manner of professional and amateur right wingersâ lawyers radio hosts professors and journalists all thrilled to find themselves in public so unspurned in the faux silk lined hallway leading into the main ballroom i watched a texanâ s cowboy hat get within kissing range of a rabbiâ s borsalino the australian was named jack he was there with the blessing of his mp boss to make contact with allies and convey the warmest greetings â itâ s exciting to be among so many intelligent people â jack was addressing a dour undergraduate from the university of texas who was scanning the crowd for luminaries and idly fielding jackâ s questions â how did you get here â â i was sort of sick of the libertarian choke hold on campus iâ ve read carlyle and evola and hazony obviously but the college republicans are still pretty captured by libertarian dogma like no interest in political economy or a national industrial policy or anything i found these folks online these guys these are the guys i like â the high degree of bonhomie in the ballroom was hard to deny conservatives in their comfort zones can establish an instant rapport aloofness is rapidly abandoned as a hindrance to the assembly of a highly charged emotional grid the speed of social fusion exceeds its own object so that everyone already seems prepared to bleed for they know not yet what we ambled toward the dinner tables just as the russia jokes began â iâ d call this stage the presidium but i donâ t want to be accused of collusion with russia â announced the stony moderator christopher demuth reaganâ s first term â deregulation czar â he handed over the reins to david brog a more treacly specimen brog had worked for the end times televangelist john hageeâ s christians united for israel before heading up sheldon adelsonâ s maccabee task force to fight the bds movement he was one of about a half a dozen organizers of the national conservatism conference â we are not alone anymore â brog bleated â we want to be connected connected to one another connected to our descendants our american brothers and sisters are crying out â his voice floated higher in register until it was full eighteenth century oracular the great awakening returned â weâ ve read burke and our bibles â it was very heaven to be alive now brog observed brexit was a sign â the british people literally stood astride history and yelled â stop â they refused to sell the birthright of their sovereignty for the shiny coins of higher gdp â and then came a line that seemed lobbed over the assembled guests directly at jennifer schuessler cultural correspondent for the new york times who was sitting in the far back of the ballroom â we are nationalists not white nationalists but no screening system is perfect so if thereâ s anyone here tonight who believes being an american has anything whatsoever to do with the color of someoneâ s skin there is the door â no one stood up to leave therefore let it be known that there were no racists breaking bread among us brog next lanced various simulacra of common sense â we give no aid to our immigrants when we promote the erosion of the reason they moved here in the first place â only by denying immigrantsâ dreams could those dreams be fulfilled he ended with pure singsong sweetness chirping out some whitman to the congregants â camerado i give you my hand i give you love more precious than money â but money could not altogether be expelled from the temple one of the conferenceâ s backers was colin moran a new york hedge funder who got up and told the audience that he liked every damn thing about national conservatism he didnâ t think it was antimarket at allâ hell it would probably be better for the market or at least his market â itâ s sometimes said that the new national conservatism is hostile to capitalism â demuth added he smiled â to rebut these scurrilous allegations we will now hear from one of the titans of american finance ladies and gentlemen peter thiel â thiel was a possible prototype of the new elite the natcons wanted to propagate he came equipped with a blowtorch to illuminate the meritocratic conspiracy among corporations and government and media yes thiel was a destroyer entrepreneur straight out of the pages of schumpeter in the fairy tale world of silicon valley startupsâ most of which were coquettishly waiting for a wall street manager to take them public or for facebook to acquire themâ thiel was a swashbuckling privateer he could take a machete to the hedgerow view of history like the most effective reactionaries he was all in on technologyâ but on his own terms he had cofounded paypal a venture that might at first seem too prosaic even beneath him until you remember that paypalâ s original mission was to become a global currency thiel was going to make great stuff again not just new iterations of phones he was going to reconnect technological advancement with political revolution he was going to colonize the moon he was going to extinguish enemies with vengeance any american journalist of my generation had to treat that last ambition with a touch of respect after a gratuitous violation of his privacy thiel had in an act of twenty first century lã se majestã singlehandedly eviscerated one of the breeding grounds of new york journalismâ gawker there were more habitats out there he could scorch to the ground thiel was a seasoned speaker heâ d stumped at the republican national convention heâ d given trump a million dollars and counseled him to become disrupter in chief thiel claimed to have received little grief from trump endorsing evangelicals for being gay nor it seemed would he get much from natcons who mostly held fast to the walt whitman position on homosexuality and nationalism though thielâ s delivery was constipated and robotic he came across as someone who could beam himself somewhere else at any given moment and so his sheer presence and attention flattered the audience he announced his intention to stick to â the spirit of what i think weâ re trying to accomplish which is widening the overton window of discourse â then his mouth dropped open like a torpedo bay and out propelled a series of questions is big tech good for the united states of america is free trade good for the u s â of a is college good for the u s is war good for us thiel was going to â drill down into some of the particularsâ of these matters google it had lost any attachment to the american nation and it was in bed with chinese intelligence its executives should be interrogated â in a not excessively gentle way â then came an interesting twist china was dirtying up the whole globe thiel said he suggested that the 25â percent tariff on chinese goods be â reframedâ as a carbon tax â and maybe the twenty five percent is a floor and not a ceiling â the audience loved the way he was co opting a left wing cause climate change for natcon ends american greatness it was even perhaps more subtle than that co opting a left wing policy program carbon taxing a country in order to encourage it to green its economy and just insisting that its content was populist protectionist the trump team according to thiel already had the correct instincts on trade â you donâ t want people negotiating trade treaties who dogmatically believe in free trade because the worse they are at negotiating the better job they think they do â but where thiel really hit his strideâ where he began to killâ was on the composition of the american elite the factories that produce this elite were the universities and that was the place to train the bomb sights the thousands of third rate colleges should be destroyed with criminal investigations while the ivies and other elite universities were taxed into oblivion for there was nothing so big as the self flattering lies told in america about education that there were so many good schools and that these institutions were the best place for selecting and training elites rather than just confirming and credentialing them he quoted michelle obama talking about her daughtersâ applications to college the one thing iâ ve been telling my daughters is that i donâ t want them to choose a name i donâ t want them to think â oh i should go to these top schools â we live in a country where there are thousands of amazing universities so the question is whatâ s going to work for you â in their defense they donâ t actually believe it â thiel said â and i would worry about them even more if they actually did â shortly after obamaâ s remarks her elder daughter went off to harvard thiel would have been â very disturbedâ if theyâ d sent her to the one thousandth ranked school instead this was genuinely funny rolling the obamas over the coals of their own utterances never got old but thiel had done more than his duty to national conservatism by intimating that a new elite could still come into being it would be a techy elite and a very small one but one that served the homeland whose normal citizens would graze among the infinite pleasures provided them the coming elite would recognize the con of mass education and spare millions the dunce hat of the community college or the online university thiel himself had already tried to buy out promising young coders from going to college in the first place the thiel fellowship accepted applications on a rolling basis and paid grantees six figures not to go to school a picture of the thielian version of the natcon future was coming into focus rooms of talented fifteen year olds finding new ways to drill into the earthâ s core and lower temperatures through sublime acts of geologic engineering children were our future if they could avoid college our savior was not the tech abstinence preaching greta thunberg but some as yet unknown prodigy funded by thiel who would figure out how to recode the physical processes of the planet thielâ s private effort to siphon off a natural aristocracy of talent from the doomed universities by plying them with cash and lab time was part of the larger field of natcon thought trump had won the election by feeding the insatiable anti elitist hunger in the nation the clintons had cooperated perfectly but nationalists and populists have as much need for elites as anyone else in the first flush of european nationalism members of the napoleonic generation found themselves promoted from cannoneers to princes of freshly conquered states the third world nationalists who came to power in decolonizing nations in the 1960s had only recently formed a stratum of colonial rule lawyers doctors poets and soldiers the trouble now in the united states was that the would have been regional ruling class had been sucked out of every corner of the heartland to join the ranks of the global meritocracy leaving the ranks of the local elite nearly empty anyone visiting an ivy league classroom could encounter twenty bright teenagers from all over the worldâ a few of them vacuumed out of obscure corners of the u s a â who all spoke the same gradient of english streamed the same tv series and believed that they represented diversity the clever sell of the pete buttigiegs and rory stewarts of the moment was to at least simulate the return to ithaca drama of a globalist come home to pay regional amends but what if meritocratic elites in general were the problem edmund burke himself had been notoriously skeptical of them especially those like himself better to be governed by half demented aristocrats with long standing claims to land and title than by intellectual hustlers who misconstrue their own rocketing social ascent with the lift off of humanity in general as thiel was escorted off the stage through a parted sea of fans i moved to the center of the ballroom something curious was happening there was a young man in a vintage tan nehru jacket speaking to a group of a dozen younger people in suits and dresses the subject appeared to be poetry â and so dickinsonâ s editor this guy thomas wentworth higginson is actually in contact with john brown â it was too propitiousâ to have the chance this early in the conference to put in a word for john brown â whatâ s the problem with john brown â i asked him the young man in the nehru jacket blinked slowly tortoiselike and a knowing smile arrived â only that he was a terrorist only that heâ s the equivalent of a pro life activist today who blows up abortion clinics because of the evil inside them â â doesnâ t it depend on what your cause is though â â are you a communist or something â he asked in a friendly sparring way â i mean itâ s okay if you are iâ m so far right that iâ m in maoist territory â the speaker was curtis yarvin a silicon valley star of the neo reactionary web whose thiel backed technology urbit was meant to reinvent computing everyone would have access to their own fiercely sovereign servers and would not have to bow to big tech yarvin the dark knight had written a series of texts under the name mencius moldbug making him a revered â alt rightâ pamphleteer i walked outside with the dark knight and two stanford undergraduates to the corner of m and 22nd â this guy is kind of famous â said undergrad one the undergrads had both recently taken a course taught by thiel â he made us read carl schmittâ s land and sea â said undergrad two â it was awesome â the pair worked as assistants to niall ferguson the conservative historian who had gotten himself into trouble at stanfordâ s hoover institution for encouraging â oppo researchâ on a liberal student â oh man it was bullshit they only got ferguson because susan riceâ s son accidentally forwarded a whole email chain to some unreliable student â â wait you mean susan riceâ â â totally conservative her son yeah â said undergrad one the dark knight was in a gregarious mood â i just wanted to get out and see whatâ s going on with the official conservatives these days â he told the group â itâ s cool that they let me come â undergrad one said he was intrigued by the anti imperial tenor at the conference â we should just dismantle the empire â the dark knight said â it could be done so quickly if you really wanted to all our embassies could be wrapped up right away thereâ s nothing in the constitution that says we have to have embassies all of those staffs could come home we can conduct diplomatic relations via skype this idea that we need people over there is so ridiculous such an anachronism â â what about israel â asked undergrad two â do you know how much we contribute to the israeli defense budget â said the dark knight â itâ s something like three or four percentâ peanuts i think we should let them loose is anybody really going to want to fuck with israel iâ d say youâ d see israel picking up new territory in no time if we just let them go we could roll in our empire and let them give empire a shot theirs could stretch from beirut to rabat i mean theyâ re jewsâ theyâ ll figure it out â the dark knight overflowed with antiquarian theories and gleanings his thoughts kept circling back to the midcentury right winger james burnham a hallowed figure among the natcons burnhamâ s trajectory perfectly matched the moment heâ d begun his career as a mild mannered professor of philosophy a genteel princetonian whom one student described as having walked out of a t â s â eliot poem but some vision amid the great depression had changed him though he was dazzled by his marxist colleague sidney hook and by his encounter with leon trotskyâ s history of the russian revolution which he interpreted as a coming attraction for america it still took a car ride through detroit the epicenter of the depression to clinch burnhamâ s conversion â the class struggle the starvation and terror in actâ that he witnessed among the cityâ s autoworkers convinced him that capitalism was ruined forever he wanted to be a part of what came next at nyu burnham still lectured on aquinas and dante but he was increasingly occupied with drafting strategies for communist party discipline his attacks on franklin roosevelt whom he accused of being an incipient totalitarian were even more vitriolic than the conservative attacks on the new deal trotsky in exile on the island of bã¼yã¼kada off istanbul was so taken with comrade burnhamâ s agitprop that he marked him as a protã gã some organizers around burnham were put off by his tailored suits his taste for champagne and baccarat and his dry patrician monotone but this was also part of what made him useful he lent american marxism a dignified patina burnham broke with the trotskyites over the question of whether the soviet union was in fact a workerâ s state trotsky thought it still qualified despite the corruptions of stalinism burnham thought it did not from his reading of new deal critics of the modern corporation such as adolf berle and gardiner means burnham came to believe that the soviet union and the united states were converging on a kind of managerialism two only marginally different planned economies with little place for individual freedom he started drifting to the right and eventually wound up as the in house guru of william f â buckleyâ s national review but his professional life did have some coherence over the decades it was spent taking up positions from various crumbling ideological ramparts to get a better shot in at his lifelong enemy the liberal elite burnham could summon a good word for the black panthers lsd and woodstock which had at least sent some shockwaves to vital center command control refreshingly the natcons and the dark knight were interested not in burnhamâ s avowedly right wing phaseâ when brittle treatises such as the suicide of the west 1964 appearedâ but in his earlier more ambivalent wartime output the managerial revolution 1941 and the machiavellians 1943 which were written in an era when burnham was still contending with â remnants of marxism â these books invoked by natcons throughout my days in washington worked like a back door through which they could smuggle materialism into their program other phrases that i did not associate with conservatives were brought out like worn old pieces of family furniture each brokered by trustworthy conservative middlemen â the ruling classâ was often cited at the ritz or just as commonly â the ruling class as angelo codevilla calls itâ â a reference to the intelligence analyst conservative professor and writer for the claremont review of books burnhamâ s chief ideaâ adopted by yarvinâ was that the american elite had become a managerial class that acted as guardians over institutions the academy and the professions they were not aristocrats nor were they capitalist tycoons but rather an office bound species that merely understood the techniques of governance and as a class no longer bothered with questions of their own legitimacy burnham had counseled a kind of equanimity in the face of this technocratic eliteâ the best you could do was to pit elites against one another in order to create space for concessionary freedoms but yarvin was more intent on destroying it he believed that the united states was simply a more advanced form of totalitarianism than china it had decentralized its despotism spread it among different sectors but the totalitarian imprint was still there americans who watched fox news were captive to one narrative and those who watched msnbc were captive to another but for yarvin the trouble was that the original mythology of american democracy was breaking down one could keep believing in it for only so long just as it had required herculean myopia to continue to believe in third world liberation long after its expiration date did anyone really still believe in american postwar innocence yarvin played at drawing the stench of the firebombing of dresden into his nostrils did anyone still believe that liberal elites wanted equality in education and so yarvin had identified a groaning gap in the conference â it will be interesting to see what kind of elite they come up with â he said day two godâ s used imperfect people all through history king david wasnâ t perfect saul wasnâ t perfect solomon wasnâ t perfect and i actually gave the president a little one pager on those old testament kingsâ i said â mr president i know there are people that say yâ know â you said you were the chosen one â â and i said â you were â â rick perry the second day of the national conservatism conference was a day of myth maintenance the men of god were gearing up peter thiel had worried that the american right was still in thrall to the myth of american exceptionalism when what was needed was the opposite more comparisons of america with other countries to see where it fell short more competition fueled by the intimation that we might not be special at all yarvin had wondered late into the night where the new myths could come from the silicon valley contingent promethean in outlook did not have much time for god it was the moment for a christian nationalist to ascend the mount they were hardly endangered over the summer hungaryâ s viktor orbã n had given a speech in a small romanian village proclaiming the blooming of a re christianized europe r â r â â rustyâ reno another conference organizer and the editor of the ecumenical catholic inflected journal first things was in the strange position of having to reconcile nationalism and christianity all over again for a twenty first century audience he took to the task with a weary sense of duty the creep of melancholy in his voice as he bore his burden in plain sight of his congregants â the anti elite populist sentiments that are abroad at the moment â reno told us â are best understood as expressions of the american love for self government faced with a liberal empire overseen by a technocratic elite the american people have become truculent this is true on the left and the right count me as no fan of socialism but i interpret its rhetorical return in the democratic party as a sign that democratic voters want to recover their political agency i dread the triumph of these loveless visions of our political future for they mean the end of the democratic age and its supersession by a managerial therapeutic empire run by central bankers and diversity consultants â for reno the particularities of the nation were not only reconcilable with christianity they furthered its cause scripture was unmistakable â if anyone does not provide for his own people and especially his own family he has disowned his faith and is worse than an infidelâ 1â timothy 5 8 the nation was no false idol for reno god in his benevolence had provided it â as a further remedy for our sinful self regard â catholics could excuse passionate love of your mate if it brought you closer to god the nation was a much higher version of that it would be a twisted act to try to take patriotic love away from our fellow citizens â many of our fellow americans have made a mess of their lives in various ways and they havenâ t accomplished very muchâ unlike many of us in the roomâ and for many of them their citizenship is their most precious possession from which they draw the greatest honor itâ s not enough that we take away the functional family lifeâ we even have to take away their own citizenship or their love of their own citizenship â reno was proffering a peculiar notion of worldly success and one could sense some self flattery working within him but elsewhere his speech took a wilder turn â there is a potential for a great deal of mischief if we fuse church with nation â he said â there are bishops in the catholic church in the united states and europe and protestant pastors who judge prudent restrictions on immigration to be violations of biblical ideals of universal welcome and universal hospitality but these ideals apply to the people of god to the church not to the united states of america â what was meant by this that border crossing was permissible for people in their capacity as christians but not in their capacity as mexicans i had a vision of el paso of trucks of mexican christians arriving at a megachurch old white texan gentlemen help the elderly mexican gentlewomen down the stairs leading them arm in arm into the church where in booming english with spanish subtitles a minister preaches the bounty of christian union and baptisms are performed on small mexican babies at the tea and biscuits session after the service one of the elderly texans notices a bulge under the loose clothing of a young mexican woman â get â em out of here â the bonds of christian fellowship having been observed it is now time to sound the alarm of national solidarity the visiting worshippers are dispatched in black vans with papered over windows to the deepest reaches of the yucatã n â next time weâ ll do the service over skype that will be better for everyone â says the minister hat in his hands â no need to have them on the soil when we already coexist on a spiritual plane â while it had fallen to reno to square christian universalism with nationalist particularism yoram hazony made bolder claims for his faith launching out against a hundred years of historiography hazony claimed that no nationalism was not about forgetting things in common or sharing a mistaken view of the past it was about keeping a covenant with god for hazonyâ founder of the princeton tory onetime confidant of netanyahu and chief talmudist of national conservatismâ nationalism began with the hebrews donald trump might speak in slogans but he was also speaking the torah the hebrew god â doesnâ t say go out and conquer all the nations of the world he says you stay behind your border â you can have this patch of land for your people and it will become great other peoples can do the same on their patches and so after a break of a few thousand years the dutch the english and finally the americans all copied the original hazonyâ s lecture stuck to the wagon ruts of traditional nationalist thought there had been jewish nationalistsâ zionists after allâ going back to the nineteenth century earlier the american founders and their english forerunners had borrowed the ideas of a chosen state from jewish thinkers the trouble was not merely that hazony swept under the carpet all the difficulties of actually existing nationalismâ where does it begin where does it end who is in and who is out â but that he was sacralizing a political compromise as a god directed project with the borders sacred and the exact mixture of people within them sacred considerable subterfuge and violence were now justifiable in defending the frozen state of this order it would have been mete and right for such somber tones to be followed by organ music instead after a coffee break there came national conservatismâ s long awaited jester â you gotta love tucker â as stanford undergraduate one had put it tucker carlson was the leading propagandist of the cause he had his own show on fox news he did daily battle with the enemy and not only battle tucker even extracted what he liked from the jacobin magazine left twisted it around and sold it at a discount to his followers he hated liberals but he resented the left for leaving his hypocrisy flagrantly exposed and so he seesawed between this hatred and this resentment in the resentment there was a kind of respect in the hatred there was mirthful righteousness â i actually have contact with the people the rest of us complain about â he began his speechâ and lo it was true not only did he have his makeup done by liberals and communists five days a week but nearly everyone in the media wanted to stop him they didnâ t succeed because even within the narrow constraints of monopoly capitalism tucker like a christian among the romans was able to get the word out and his virtuous flock heeded the call the natcons were in awe of the great deflection service tucker provided for the american ruling class identifying actual material grievances and laboriously laundering them into petty insecurities familiar from the nineties culture wars tucker preached the national conservatism gospel even without quite understanding it the organizers believed he contained a wisdom he himself did not fully recognize like a fool in shakespeare his demeanor was bouncy and cheerful the vibe was part groton lacrosse cheerleader part finance frat boy his face was ruddied from his summer in maine where heâ d been communing with his ethnos his pace was a bit stop and start at the beginningâ heâ d just given up nicotineâ but his signature tic was there the planted joke followed by the waterfall throw back the head court of versailles laugh he was like a man who looked down at his mouth amazed that it had been transformed into a giant conveyor belt dispensing perfect modules of common sense his trust in his subjective experience was immense tucker had some tough news for the assembled faithful â big business hates your familyâ was the title of his talk monopoly capitalism was real â the main threat to your ability to live your life as you choose does not come from the government but comes from the private sector â tucker said â i was trained from the youngest age from a pup to believe that the threats to liberty came from government and so it really took a huge amount of evidence wagging right in my faceâ not being the brightest person in d c â to realize that in 2019â the threats come primarily from companies and not from the federal government â he could give examples â all new oreos have the label â whatâ s your pronoun â a large american company is committing a pretty brazen act of propaganda aimed at your kids and the message is that the binary gender scheme which we were taught in biology class in seventh grade is no longer operative â in fighting this the libertarians would be worse than useless their response was yeah well if you donâ t like it start your own oreo company â but thatâ s not really an operative option in a world of monopoly power you canâ t create your own google you have more power vested in fewer hands than at any time in american history and that itself is ominous and should make all of us cast aside any thread of ideology or theology or whatever just look at that straight in the face are you comfortable with that you shouldnâ t be of course youâ re not they can make whole ideas disappear and thereâ s some evidence that theyâ re working to do that â for tucker trump was a galactic tear in the universe setting the terms of a new reality anything was possible â if the loch ness monster exists what about the yeti â versailles laughter â the trump election spurred in me a kind of reassessment of ufos iâ m serious and it turns out like theyâ re real â laughter again tucker riled his audience a bit when he exposed his knowledge of the american left he found bits to admire in warrenâ s â economic patriotism â and as long as the left kept quiet about the minorities and the migrants some of them were promising candidates for a left right nationalist pact for this was tuckerâ s great insight the social democratic left was essentially right about economics it would be good to nationalize social media it would be good to boost american wages the trouble with the left was that it wanted to do these things on behalf of an amorphous citizenry with no sense of boundaries for where american bounty should stop we already knew who americans were tucker implied the definition was settled americans were people who watched and believed tucker carlson it did all raise a question what if trump had dialed down the white nationalism after taking the white house and instead of betraying nearly every word of his campaign rhetoric of economic populism had ruthlessly enacted populist policies passing gargantuan infrastructure bills shredding nafta instead of remodeling it giving a tax cut to the lower middle class instead of the rich and conspiring to raise the wages of american workers it doesnâ t take much to imagine how that would play against a democratic challenger with mckinsey or harvard law school imprinted on his or her forehead there seemed to be two futures for trumpism as a distinctive strain of populism one in which the last reserves of white identity politics were mined until the cave collapsed and one in which the coalition was expanded to include working americans enlisting blacks and hispanics and asians in the cause of conquering the condescending citadels of wokistan was it predestined that trump would choose the former steve bannon was already audience testing trumpism 2 0 wrong footing the crowd at the oxford union with complaints about the lack of black technicians in silicon valley why couldnâ t trumpism go in this direction in reality the shrewdest move for the natcons would surely have been to attract as many non whites as possible to the ritz and strike fear into the hearts of the globalists with a multiracial populist carnivalâ a new post trump pan ethnic coalition that would someday consider it quaint that it had once needed to begin conferences with the profession we are not actually racist for the rest of the afternoon i wandered into talks and panels and discussions and cocktail chatter on the floor i saw daniel pipes the old right winger and son of the historian of the russian revolution richard pipes â i think in the end my father was a social democrat â pipes confessed to me in the tone of coming to terms with oneâ s father having served in the waffen ss he was scowly and solemn and appeared like an orthodox priest who had misplaced his thurible he spent the afternoon on a panel defending eastern european right wing movements as â civilizationistâ paladins regarding their anti semitism more as growing pains than as an inherent feature of their ideology among the other revelers in infamy was amy wax accompanying the dark knight i entered her talk in a small conference room which she opened with a defense of enoch powellâ a â prophet without honor in the last century â yarvin was getting giddy off of waxâ s denunciation of the â magic dirtâ idea which purports that immigrants are transformed by the u s soil into better people â oh my god sheâ s going for itâ sheâ s talking about â magic dirt â you know powell was a brigadier in the army right dude was super fucking tough â then wax descended into a diatribe calling out immigrants as littering noise polluters who did not meet the conditions of our societyâ in her own way repeating in degraded english the kind of view henry james had once given voice to in a description of the jewish ghetto of the lower east side â some vast sallow aquarium in which innumerable fish of overdeveloped proboscis were to bump together forever amid heaped soils of the sea â wax presented more than just a pr problem for the natcons in her encomium to the berkshires and other clean white places in america where she likes to spend time she exposed one of the contradictions of the natcons setting their anti elitist rhetoric against their elitist behavior of the speakers at the conference it was only the notre dame professor patrick deneen who argued with some cogency that the natcons needed to foster new local mini aristocracies that would both keep the â câ of â conservatismâ smallâ and not court big government all over again as some of the natcons clamoring for an industrial policy seemed to want awkwardly for deneenâ s reputation but less awkwardly for his bank account obama had read and liked his book why liberalism failed in the bar the dark knight and i found a table of older conservatives there was daniel oliver the onetime executive editor of national review and a friend of buckley and burnham we ordered a round of gin and tonics the dark knight wanted to know about burnham â the most charming man â said oliver the american revolution was the topic on the table â you know when the queen of england came for the bicentennial to boston my great uncle received her since he was descended from the last line of tory governors â yarvin launched into his loyalist account of the american revolution he was incensed that the whig interpretation had infected all of the historiography â itâ s so sad that people believe that america won the war militarily or that if the british had just conciliated more they could have kept the colonies i mean the whigs in england wanted to lose they sent general howeâ a total radicalâ to fight the war thatâ s like sending bill ayers to lead the response to the tet offensive â we discussed the coming attractions of the conference â iâ m thinking of organizing a boycott of john bolton â joked william ruger the vice president for research at the charles koch institute bolton was a persona not very grata among the natcons recently anointed national security adviser he was the sort of old guard republican loyalist that many people at the conference loathed â bolton just loves war too much â said ruger â never saw a war he didnâ t like â in the corner of the ritz bar i saw jennifer schuessler of the new york times trump was firing out tweets against ilhan omar and alexandria ocasio cortez telling them to go back to their countries the mediasphere was saturated with outrage and glee schuessler was asking conference participants about the tweets but no one was taking the bait the natcons treated her like a poor uninitiated innocent they performed looks of pity when she asked about the administrationâ s actual record pushed on the trump question hazony gave a supercilious smile that seemed to say if you have to ask about tweets youâ re never going to be ready for conversion in the evening there was a floor debate that pitted a representative of the pure free market creed against the natcon mutation richard reinsch a hale indianan who worked for the liberty fund which subsidizes the reprinting of friedrich hayekâ s works faced off against oren cass a young policy wonk from the manhattan institute the question at hand â should america adopt an industrial policy â reinsch was perfectly orthodox in his defense of the status quo â in real terms growth in manufacturing has kept up with the growth of the economy over the previous seventy years â he told the ballroom its declining employment share was the result of increased productivity â in 1980 ten man hours to make a ton of steel â reinsch said â in 2015 two man hours even if manufacturing wages are on average higher than service sector wages it doesnâ t follow that tariffs will make more jobs that pay at the current manufacturing wage â the implication was politically clear good luck trying to wean american workers off cheap products at walmart oren cass wanted to do something close to that â we see slowing productivity growth â he said â we see slow to non existent wage growth a male with a high school degree in 1970 could have supported a family of four at more than twice the poverty line in 2016 heâ s only about thirty five percent above it â libertarians were trying to tie the governmentâ s hands too much which was preventing u s â participation in the wordwide competition of each nation protecting its own workers â you can have free trade or you can have free markets but you canâ t have both â said cass to the audienceâ s delight in support of cass further speeches came from the floor a voice from the south j â d â vanceâ s made a searing appeal in emotional tones the author of hillbilly elegy vance was the bard of the natcons the most gifted lyricist of trumpism he was from appalachia and had climbed his way into the elite hive of yale law school â iâ m a venture capitalist â he said â if youâ re in the peninsula right off highway 101 thereâ s an exit called willow road and on willow road youâ ll find the facebook headquarters and at facebook there are neuroscientists currently being paid a lot of money quite literally to addict our children to their applications and not far from the facebook headquarters there are neuroscientists working on how to cure dementia and how to cure some of the most intractable diseases that affect our society the people who are working at facebook addicting our children to their applications make much more money than the people who are attempting to cure our society of its worst diseases and i think this question about whether we should have an industrial policy ultimately reduces to the question of do you think our politics should have an answer about whether it is more valuable to cure our grandchildren than to addict them to terrible applications and i think the answer is obviously yes â there was mighty applause vance was followed by mini vances a young republican from texas spoke of the loss he feels in the west of his state covered he said in â these beautiful storefronts that are empty â if texas republicans did not purge themselves of neoliberal tendencies theyâ d eventually lose the state to democrats who were already refining the rhetoric of economic populism a floor vote was taken and cassâ s side easily won it was 99 in favor of a national industrial policy 51 against in the hot dark walking back to my hotel i nodded to julius krein the thirty three year old editor of american affairs the natcon house journal he was among the more serious of the instant intellectuals whom trumpâ s political arrival had spewed forth michael anton the most well known â trumpist intellectual â was a caricature of academic straussianism by comparison a man who rambled about xenophon and whose speech at the natcon conference sounded like a preface to a preface of a preface to a commentary on a commentary on a classical text no with his suit neatly parted hair and his flat midwestern vowels krein appeared like a whiz kid from the kennedy administration but in his style of argument he was the closest thing that the natcons had to a re embodied james burnham like burnham krein believed that both the left and the right had misidentified the radical agent in recent american history it was not the devastated working class as the left believed which could barely find its feet politically nor was it the 401 k holding american masses who kept the faith of market fundamentalism more than socialist curious elites for krein the war to win was within the elite it was a question of who would exploit the amour propre of the professional managerial class and enlist it in a battle against the top 1 percentâ or top 1â percent up until this point the billionaire class had operated in near perfect conditions with a democratic party that swooned over them and a republican party that was so conveniently repulsive to the top 10â percent that it drew their energy away from revolutionary rumbles much as the bernie sanders strategists wondered about how many warrenites they could attract to socialism before she embarked on an inevitable voyage back to the center so krein and his cadre wanted to make national conservatism a viable alternative for a new more politically responsible elite that would not shy from war with the globalists day three when men of rank sacrifice all ideas of dignity to an ambition without a distinct object and work with low instruments and for low ends the whole composition becomes low and base â edmund burke reflections on the revolution in france john bolton arrived to a room of skeptics but there was no walkout civility persisted in the ballroom of the ritz in the face of at least a few holdout enemies and a press corps visibly uncomfortable in his presence bolton showed that he was after all a professional operator here was a man who in law school had stayed up into the wee hours converting clarence thomas to conservatism or so the rumor went one audience member tried to bait bolton with a question about immigration in europe â should we be worried about european birth levels â but bolton sensing a trap resisted this he did not want to tell europeans how many children they should have nor africans either he wasnâ t going to perform any symbolic allegiance to trumpist themes instead he bore down on the points he wanted to make to an audience that viewed him as oil in the water of trumpâ s foreign policy venezuela might have to be occupied by the united states why well it was already occupied by the cubans â if the 20 000 or more cubans in venezuela left tomorrow the maduro government would fall by midnight â nato nations needed to pay their fair share just as obama had said though trump had said it more forcefully there was more continuity between the two administrations than the natcons might like to acknowledge bolton was allergic to pandering and made no attempt to hide his addiction to american global supremacy and wars of choice he was honest about his wish never to get clean in the coming months the irony of trumpâ s militarism would exceed the mediaâ s capacity to comprehend it bolton like james mattis before him was fired or resigned in view of what he thought of as an unacceptable troop withdrawal that trump had committed to but did not actually undertake in fact trump had doubled down on nearly every military theater in which the united states had troops at the back of the ballroom i spotted keith gessen jotting down notes on boltonâ s remarks it was strange to see him there a literary figure of major standing in brooklyn a cofounder of n 1 the most successful leftist magazine of his generation there was nothing doctrinaire about him he was curious about the proceedings around him and ready to score the performances â itâ s impressive how bolton just wonâ t let them get to himâ heâ s too experienced â he said â some of these guys seem reasonable enough j â d â vanceâ s stuff about supporting working familiesâ i mean itâ s not exactly bad what heâ s saying â gessen was from russian intelligentsia stock when he read histories of the revolution he rooted for the mensheviks who lost every time he had a natural affinity for the underdog but he was put off by the natconsâ pretensions by their absurd miming of learnedness and by their you must break eggs justifications of the trump approach â must say that it remains one of the chief regrets of the time i spent in washington d c this summer â he would later write â that i shook michael antonâ s hand â there were a few people at the national conservatism conference of whom it was whispered â future president right there â it had been said of j â d â vance who managed to conjure a world that was almost palatable to liberals vance was careful about his gender roles and even gave evidence that suggested he had experience changing diapers it had been said of tucker carlson that he would be even better than trump as a white house personality but it was josh hawley over whom the crown most plausibly hovered he was thirty nine years old the youngest man in the senate a former clerk for justice john roberts on the supreme court and biographer when in his twenties of teddy roosevelt hawley was a scholar warrior out of natcon heaven in presentation and style he reminded me of the young austrian leader sebastian kurz who had made his name as the shiny new bridge to the authoritarians in eastern europe but who was still suave enough to appeal to carinthian grandmothers i took my seat early at the dinner for hawley a recent convert to mormonism was bad mouthing the supreme court justices trump had to do better â you really donâ t like kavanaugh â i asked her â no i mean gorsuch have you read his decisions on indians he wants to give it all back to the indians insidious rulings â another law clerk was speculating about ginsburgâ s physical health â amy wax is a doctor and says that ginsburg even with all her exercise will still be dead within two years so itâ s looking good â the dark knight was trying to convince the table that the most important book to understand the moment was the final pagan generation by edward j â watts which is about how the last pagans in the roman empire had managed their lives in the upsurge of christianity and how quickly their millennia old culture had been pulverized by a small cadre of young zealous christian elite this was the dark knightâ s persistent worry who were the true believers at the conference and who were the opportunists roosevelt could be an opportunist hawley writes in his biography of teddy â but he was no crass intellectual opportunist â but what was hawley he came onto the stage in a more powerful thrust than had anyone at the conference so far and his speech would be a summa of all that had come before like thiel he wanted to go to war on big tech and he had introduced bills that showed he was serious like patrick deneen he was worried about how to create communities led by aristo populists like tucker he was fast on his feet and projected smiley confidence but he could also compete with hazonyâ s boyish rocking back and forth between solemnity and mischief â the great divide of our time is not between trump supporters and trump opponents â hawley intoned in a kind of grand old man oratory that seemed to conjure its own pulpit â or between suburban voters and rural ones or between red america and blue america no the great divide of our time is between the political agenda of the leadership elite and the great and broad middle of our society and to answer the discontent of our time we must end that divide we must forge a new consensus we must recover and renew the dream of the republic â he was getting more roman every minute then he rounded on his enemy â call it the cosmopolitan consensus on economics this consensus favors globalizationâ closer and closer economic union more immigration more movement of capital more trade on whatever terms the boundaries between america and the rest of the world should fade and eventually vanish the goal is to build a global consumer economy one that will provide an endless supply of cheap goods most of them made with cheap labor overseas but funded by american dollars â according to the cosmopolitan consensus globalization was a moral imperative the elites distrusted patriotism and â the common culture that was left to us by our forebears â whatâ s more they were happy to say as much for the record a roll call of enemies of the people followed mitâ s richard sennett had denounced â the evil of shared national identity â according to martha nussbaum it was morally dangerous to teach students that they are â above all citizens of the united states â you would have never known from hawleyâ s speech that there are cosmopolitans working at starbucks and people who believe in socialism riding bikes for grubhub yet it was still extraordinary to listen to the feat of rhetoric a conservative slipping seamlessly back and forth between class based attacks and cultural tirades bashing the elite on class grounds claiming againâ as in the days of t r â and of reagan â that republicans were on the side of the common man against a sequestered elite that had transformed the ivory tower into a great turret of the renewed culture war my table was smitten with hawleyâ s embroideries then hawley dropped into the kind of national unity speech that obama used to do in his sleep for in the heart of our country american strength has not failed the kind of people who built this nation are here still waking early and working late manning the fire department and coaching the little league helping the neighbor who just lost a spouse donating their gas money to a needy family halfway around the world and then the theme did become actually roman â i wonder if you remember the story of horatius at the bridge â hawley said â it happened in the early days of the roman republic sometime around 500 b c the etruscan army the story goes marched on rome to invade and the roman defenses were caught off guard eventually the fighting coalesced around a bridge leading across the tiber into the city all was chaos the roman generals surprised and unsure were falling back the city seemed in great peril but a junior officer named horatius thought otherwise he saw that if the roman army could simply hold the bridge long enough for the city to reset its defenses the republic could be saved so as the senior officers retreated he advanced macaulay tells us that as he charged to the front line horatius glanced over his shoulder to the roman hills and caught a glimpse of his own home there and knew that it was worth defending and so he took his stand we know with the benefit of history that the roman republic was still then quite young its most glorious days were still ahead but horatius didnâ tâ couldnâ tâ know that as he took up his position he only knew that to every man upon this earth death cometh soon or late and how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods â now we too need courage in our nationâ s moment of need now we too need bravery born of love for the place we call home for our republic is yet young and our greatest days are yet unwrittenâ if we will stand â so let us stand together let us stand for love of country and hearth and home let us stand with the conviction of horatius forâ in yon strait path a thousand may well be stopped by three now who will stand on either hand and keep the bridge with me when hawley had finished everyone in the ritz ballroom stood up we were unified and collected at my table there was still the lingering question of whether hawley was an ideological freeloaderâ or the real deal the truth was that it was the wrong question for trump was doing tricky ideological lifting that went all but unappreciated by the natcons he fed the richest in society in the currency they preferâ dollarsâ and he fed his fans lower down with a temporarily effective substituteâ recognition it takes a certain talent to keep so much in the air the trumpists will survive the end of trump but they will also inherit trumpâ s circus act the dimmer natcons aspire to sustain the performance the more earnest want to slip an actual popular agenda into the mix but when the time is ripe the grand old party will treat trumpian idealism like any debt ridden entity selling it for what they can once theyâ ve stripped it of its parts
economic growth has slowed for two consecutive years after jumping sharply in 2017 this year a cautious resumption of monetary easing is on the cards ahead of general elections in december with the aim of giving slowing economic growth a boost by increasing liquidity in the economy and reducing the cost of borrowing although there are political considerations involved in this the manner in which the current top tier executive management of the bank of ghana replaced their predecessors following the assumption of office of the president nana akufo addo assumption in 2017 has put paid to any illusions that the central bank is fully independent of the executive arm of government as established by law the economics of ghana s current circumstances support monetary easing too inflation by the end of 2019 was 7 9 percent which is lower than both government s end of year target and the median of the bog s target band of eight percent plus or minus two percent the cedi has been relatively stable since recovering from its world beating rate of depreciation during the first ten weeks of last year and indeed actually appreciated marginally against the united states dollar during the end of year festivities in stark contrast to its traditional tendency to depreciate significantly because of demand for foreign exchange to fund the customary year end rise in imports to meet the seasonal spike in consumerism furthermore economic growth has slowed for two consecutive years after jumping sharply in 2017 year on year growth by the third quarter of last year had fallen to 5 4 percent well below both the 8 5 percent achieved in 2017 and the 7 0 percent targeted for 2019 although the bog claims to be an inflation targeting central bank in actual fact economic growth considerations are given the same quantitative weight as inflation targeting in the setting of its benchmark monetary policy rate every two months importantly the decision by the america s federal reserve bank not to raise its key federal funds rate currently 1 6 percent means monetary easing in ghana should not lead to an exit stampede by foreign portfolio investors from government s medium and long term cedi denominated domestic debt securities this is a crucial consideration since the most recent cut in the mpr by 100 basis points down to 16 0 percent a year ago led to such heavy disinvestment by foreign portfolio investors resulting in sharp cedi depreciation and ultimately a financing crisis for government this was because the mpr cut was made at a time the us fed was tightening its own monetary policy stance thus increasing interest rates in america just as the bog was lowering rates in ghana the economist intelligence unit has predicted a cut in the bog s mpr by the last week in january further heightening expectations by heavily credit dependent corporate ghana that interest rates are about to be guided downwards for the first time since this time last year indeed expectations have shifted from whether or not the mpr will be cut to the extent of the impending cut with predictions ranging from 50 basis points to 100 basis points which would leave the benchmark rate at either 15 5 percent or 15 0 percent as the case may be but corporate ghana may be getting ahead of itself the bog has been very cautious about monetary easing over the past one year and indeed the international monetary fund is recommending readiness to actually go the other way towards monetary tightening in order to ameliorate the effects of any fiscal deficit overrun by government during the run up to the 2020 general elections as has usually been the case in election years the imf will not get that particular wish though bog governor dr ernest addison has publicly declared his confidence that government will keep within its self imposed 5 0 percent of gross domestic product fiscal deficit ceiling this year and thus does not expect the need to tighten monetary policy in response to fiscal pressures nevertheless the central bank will be very cautious in its monetary easing possibly implementing two consecutive 50 basis point reductions in the mpr rather than one 100 basis points cut besides this the bog will prudently try to get short term interest rates to fall faster than medium and long term interest rates indeed the latter may be kept where they are now thus steepening ghana s yield curve actually this is a strategy introduced by the bog last year it aims at lowering borrowing costs for local private enterprise which mainly borrows short term because of the dearth of long term deposits to prudently finance long term loans while keeping medium and long term rates high enough to retain the patronage of foreign portfolio investors who subscribe to more than 80 percent of the government debt securities issued over such tenors this is prudent strategy and importantly local enterprises in ghana that issue medium term corporate bonds on the stock market to finance their activities such as letshego bayport and ishwe all of them being savings and loans companies have already adjusted to the higher medium term interest rates they have had to offer on their corporate bond issues over the past year and a half thus a steepening of ghana s yield curve through lower short term rates but stable medium long term rates will enable local private enterprise to borrow more cheaply but at the same time retain yields on medium and long term government and corporate debt issuances that are high enough to keep foreign portfolio investors happy however deposit rates will not fall commensurately because financial intermediation firms are already having to cope with slower industry wide deposit growth than at any other time over the past decade banking industry deposits only grew by some 17 1 percent year on year up to october 2019 according to the latest data from the bog compared with 20 7 percent during the previous year with the recent melt downs in both the savings and loans and the microfinance industries making investors more conservative as to where they keep their monies safety has become as important as offered yields but the smaller banks and non bank financial intermediaries in particular are having to fight harder than ever before to attract sufficient deposits with which to generate profits that justify the significant increases in capital put up by their shareholders under recent recapitalization programmes insisted on by the bog competition for deposits will be intensified this year because of the commencement of deposit insurance because only retail deposits will be guaranteed under the scheme with relatively low caps many astute depositors will opt to spread their monies across several different institutions in order to stay within the cap in each institution so that effectively all their deposits will be insured this creates the potential for a more level playing field than ever before among deposit taking financial institutions but this will be underpinned by fiercer competition for deposits as well with offered yields being the major competitive tool employed competition will also intensify in the financial services industry along the lines of service quality and product innovation as well here digitization will be the biggest driving force already all the banks in ghana have deployed digital apps that offer lots of unprecedented convenience for customers with regards to providing payment platforms as a way of attracting relatively cheap deposits other genres of financial intermediaries are now enthusiastically following suit this being made possible by partnering the growing number of financial technology firms that design and distribute digital products and services on their behalf this trend will intensify further this year government s plans to issue yet another us 3 billion eurobond relatively early in the year aims to relieve pressure on the domestic money market from its own financing needs thus making more loanable funds available to needy private enterprises and households but the banks themselves are proving more comfortable investing in what cedi denominated government debt securities are available than in lending to the private sector despite the considerably wider interest margins derived from the latter how monetary easing and consequent lower yields on government securities and lending rates on private sector lending will play out is yet to be seen stock market based on trend analysis it is expected that the ghana stock exchange should rebound this year an election year after ending 2019 with a woeful performance returning about 12 25 with a market capitalization of ghc 56 791 28 million investopedia defines trend analysis as a technique

followed by 2008 and then 2012 returning 58 06 percent and 23 81 percent respectively all of these being election years however1992 and 2016 were odd as the market returned 3 63 percent and 15 33 percent respectively which means expectations of a bull market this year based on similar trends in the past are not cast in iron fundamental reasons could be attributed to these returns aside the fact that they were election years the stock exchange thrives on good financial performance of the listed companies which emanates mainly from stable macro economic factors the 2016 woeful performance was attributed to high inflation high interest rate unstable exchange rate power crises among others mainly emanating from preceding years it is anticipated that the stock market can only rebound when the banking crises is entirely resolved and when locked up funds are adequately released to beneficiaries a major policy for 2020 will be the development of a harmonised primary dealer manual to guide

receiving us dollars to finance operations but cannot add on to the price in any way that would cause the rates spiral due to the foreign exchange risks associated with exposure to offshore investors government in close coordination with the bank of ghana will undertake periodic bond buyback operations to ensure orderly redemption of domestic debt held by foreign investors this will help mitigate

one fine day in october 2014 kenyans were just going about their business when unexpected news came in without their having to break a sweat every kenyan was declared richer by the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs each citizen saw their income per year jump by sh26 200 after the size of the country s economy was re assessed to include new sectors as a result gross domestic product gdp the sum of all the goods and services produced in the country expanded by 25 per cent kenya joined a club of not so rich but not so poor countries known as lower middle income countries lmics kenya leapfrogged ethiopia and ghana to become the fifth largest economy in sub saharan africa behind nigeria south africa angola and sudan unfortunately kenyans newfound income which economists describe as gdp per capita existed only on paper they did not get new jobs better salaries or additional plates of ugali but in one fell swoop that day in october redefined kenya s economic landscape and five years later kenyans on twitter refer to that re evaluation of their economy with the phrase vitu kwa ground ni different what was on paper never quite translated into reality the country further found itself missing out on cheap loans from bretton woods institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf because well they were rich enough to afford the more expensive loans expensive loans however while the expensive loans from banks and international capital markets have led to more roads bridges airports and railways the economic returns from this infrastructure has not come in as fast as repayment dates between 2010 and 2015 the country s budget deficit the difference between the money it spends and the money it raises through taxes was among the lowest in africa at 1 9 per cent of gdp in fact compared to other sub saharan africa countries kenya s budget deficit placed it at position 14 the rebasing also meant the fraction of public debt to gdp dropped giving the government more room to borrow by 2017 the country s ravenous appetite for debt and its redefined borrowing avenues saw the budget deficit rise to 7 9 per cent of gdp this created a vicious borrowing cycle as the deficit had to be plugged through loans expensive loans with prohibitive interest rates short grace periods and even shorter repayment periods kenyans started working for creditors in the year to june 2019 for every sh100 the country earned from taxes non tax revenues and grants from donors sh57 went into servicing debt six years ago the treasury would pay out sh25 from every sh100 earned imf which in 2018 noted that kenya s probability of defaulting had increased from low to moderate said interest payments on the public debt increased to almost one fifth of the country s revenue putting it among the top five frontier economies this was due to the accumulation of expensive loans including over sh500 billion in eurobonds which is debt borrowed from international markets and denominated in dollars the result has been that the government is looking to deeply cut its spending but these austerity measures threaten to reduce the circulation of money in an economy facing a cash crunch that has seen companies fire workers due to erratic incomes gdp has increasingly featured in headlines but tends to seem so far removed from reality that it has given rise to a new kenyan proverb you can t eat gdp president uhuru kenyatta himself has commented on the country s meteoric gdp growth in his 2016 state of the nation address he acknowledged that ordinary kenyans cannot relate to such colourful economic indicators wananchi want to know what these economic indicators mean to their lives they cannot relate to how gdp impacts on the price of unga many of our citizens are wondering why their children are still struggling to find jobs these concerns are legitimate and they are questions that every citizen is entitled to have answers from their government said mr kenyatta private investment the narrative has since been picked up by economists like central bank of kenya cbk governor patrick njoroge who took on the pitfalls of infrastructure driven growth it is true you have gdp numbers but you can t eat gdp he said gdp as a measure of a country s well being has been heavily criticised for its many gaps yet its relevance has not diminished since 1937 when american economist simon kuznets came up with the indicator the united nations came up with the human development index hdi in one of the many attempts to cure the problem of gdp hdi takes into account indicators like the happiness of a population how long one lives standards of living and levels of knowledge while on gdp lists kenya sits below eight african countries it lags behind 15 when it comes to hdi an indictment of the government s policy priorities kenyans are poorer in terms of human development when compared to their lmic peers while it might appear unfair to compare kenya s poverty levels with some of the other countries considered lower middle income a 2018 world bank report compared kenya to its peer ghana and the results were disheartening the poverty headcount in ghana at the lmic line 34 9 per cent is 28 8 percentage points less than that in kenya kenya s depth of poverty at the lmic line is substantially higher than ghana and the lmic aggregate noted the report the question on growth figures is if the economy churned out more healthcare services legal services newspapers fruit juices skyscrapers tables loaves of bread and beers who would have produced these how many people would be involved and did they earn more for their labour the verdict has largely been brutal with experts pointing out that with jobs and wages failing to grow gdp figures are not living up to the promise as dr njoroge puts it infrastructure driven growth does not trickle down to the majority the private sector made up of households and businesses is the proverbial goose that lays the golden eggs eight in 10 people are employed in the private sector it is this sector that pays taxes yet its contribution to the economy has been declining the contribution from private investment has been negative in recent years declining from 1 3 percentage points of gdp in the four years leading to 2013 to 0 3 percentage points in the four years leading to 2017 read a world bank report on private capital in kenya the nairobi securities exchange nse an arena for commercial activities continues to experience a listing drought even as several businesses that went public either register losses or sharp profit drops the benchmark nse 20 share index which closed yesterday at 2 669 23 points has gradually fallen from an all time high of 6 161 46 in january 2007 few counters outside of safaricom and banks experience activity two of the sectors that have taken a plunge include the agriculture and manufacturing sectors as agricultural productivity has dwindled kenya has increasingly turned overseas to feed itself as a share of total imports food imports have increased from seven per cent in 2008 to 10 per cent in 2017 according to figures from the food and agriculture organisation fao kenya s poorer neighbours like uganda ethiopia tanzania and rwanda have a lower cereal imports dependency ratio meaning most of the maize wheat rice and other cereals that they consume are produced locally except for animal products and potatoes kenya has had to import nearly all the other food crops to supplement depressed local production according to official data agriculture is not only the largest economic sector but it is also the largest employer with one in six kenyans engaged in either crop farming or rearing of livestock the second largest employer is the manufacturing sector unfortunately its contribution to gdp has been shrinking with firms spooked by a crippling cost of production to create more jobs uhuru wants the share of manufacturing to gdp to inch up to 15 per cent by 2022 however two years after the government outlined its agenda of increasing value addition manufacturing as a percentage of gdp stands at 7 6 per cent as of june 2019 further even as more goods and services were produced a typical employee s wages adjusted for the increase in the cost of living remained stagnant minimum wage wages economists say tend to be sticky ideally if you are running a business and realise that your costs of production have gone up you need to slash them to remain in the business however due to contracts and distortions such as minimum wage legislation from labour unions a business cannot simply cut employee salaries as part of its cost cutting measures as a result says scholastica odhiambo an economics lecturer at maseno university wages have remained stuck even as gdp has grown to reduce costs most businesses over the last 10 years have opted to remain informal no labour unions no pension no medical cover for employees no permanent structure indeed nine out of 10 employees in kenya make a living from the informal sector which is characterised by low wages we have to be concerned with the growth of informal jobs and decline in real wages relative to exponential growth in real gdp says dr odhiambo gerrishon ikiara an economics lecturer at the university of nairobi however says the depressed wages might also be a pointer to employers having more bargaining power
investors especially in china remain wary as doubts and tariffs continue to linger over us china trade relations asian currencies inched higher on thursday supported by hopes the first phase of the us china trade deal could herald warmer relations between the world s two biggest economies and help to revive global growth the message is actually very very simple tariffs are not going up this year and that s really all we need said ken peng citi s head of asia investment strategy told reuters beijing and washington touted the phase 1 deal signed overnight at the white house as a step forward in resolving their bitter 18 month trade dispute us vice president mike pence fed optimism for progress saying further phase 2 discussions had already begun that put the new zealand dollar on track for its first intra day rise in a week and its 0 2 percent lift led small but broad based gains it last traded at 0 6635 the chinese yuan the most sensitive currency to the us china trade relationship drifted back towards a six month peak hit on tuesday adding 0 1 percent to 6 8842 per us dollar the safe haven japanese yen was a fraction softer at 109 92 per us dollar while the australian dollar held a tad firmer at 0 6908 the greenback was also marginally lower against the euro and pound with analysts figuring a bounce back in the world economy could be negative for the us dollar against a basket of currencies the us dollar sat at 97 195 close to a week low the centrepiece of the trade deal is a pledge by china to buy at least an additional 200bn worth of us farm products and other goods and services over two years the us will also cut by half the tariff rate it imposed on september 1 on a 120bn list of chinese goods to 7 5 percent yet market exuberance was checked because much of this was priced in already and because it addresses few of the issues that led to the trade conflict in the first place there s been a lot of criticism of this particular deal said mike hanna al jazeera correspondent in washington dc the most prominent of these arguments is that the limited deal does not address beijing s subsidies for state owned companies and allegations of chinese state control in cybersecurity he said on top of that the agreement does not fully eliminate tariffs is vague on enforcement and many analysts are sceptical of how realistic the purchase targets are in asia stock markets were mixed as investors assessed the news shares in hong kong were largely flat while australian equities were modestly higher along with those in south korea key stock exchange gauges in japan and shanghai slipped us futures were little changed after the s p 500 index wednesday notched a fresh all time high treasuries held gains with 10 year yields below 1 8 percent and us oil hovered about 58 a barrel the price of brent crude oil gained about 45 cents or 0 7 percent to trade at 64 45 per barrel markets here in asia are surprisingly calm in beijing that really reflects the response to the deal al jazeera correspondent katrina yu said the lack of a celebration in response to the trade deal was partly because it has been long expected and also because it s seen here in beijing as a huge compromise yu said china s pledge to buy at least 200bn of us goods and services over the next two years was met with scepticism as the sum was higher than a baseline of 186bn in purchases in 2017 before the us began imposing punitive tariffs although gold was flat the swiss franc which is seen as a safe haven investment rallied overnight to a 15 month high of 0 9680 per dollar and points to the level of caution among investors say analysts i m not sure that there s any hidden gold nugget westpac fx analyst sean callow told reuters there s a sense of markets having traded off the positive vibes of the trade agreement for long enough and it s very hard to see where the upside is from here he said if there is a step towards freer trade and lower tariffs then it s obviously not going to happen anytime soon
petrol gold and other luxurious items have become dearer due to trade war between china and the us it will have a bad impact in our purchasing power in its recent economic and fiscal outlook international monetary fund imf warned that the two greatest potential dangers to global growth in 2019 were a no deal brexit and an escalation of trade war between the us and china the first looks unlikely but the second has brought the whole world into a course of dilemma about the world economy until now the world thought that there is no backing from globalization and liberalization but ongoing trade tussles and tariff attacks between the us and china have raised the question on future of globalization and relevance of protectionism it has been claimed that public support for free trade is shrinking and the long standing political consensus that trade liberalization is beneficial is under attack the us has shifted to protectionism by imposing tariffs and continuously threatening its largest trading partners the eu and china brexit too is partly driven by a protectionist attitude although the uk intends to enter into free trade agreements ftas with other countries the move away from the single market is itself a rejection of free trade within the eu throughout history wars and economic depressions have led to increase in protectionism while peace and prosperity have tended to encourage free trade and globalization the european monarchies favored protectionist policies in the 17th and 18th centuries in an attempt to increase trade and build their domestic economies at the expense of other nations during the 18th and 19th centuries europe benefited enormously from protectionism the most popular methods of protectionism include quotas and tariffs on imports tax cuts or subsidies for domestic companies are also protectionist measures free trade policies were more successful in promoting gdp growth than protectionism during the 20th century trump s trade war began in january 2018 when he ordered tariffs on solar panels and washing machines followed by duties on steel and aluminum with exemptions for some countries then came the march in 2018 when president trump announced tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum including metals from china and imposition of 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods accusing china of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft since then the two countries stand affront in a hard and non ending debate pointing fingers to each other as threatening the world order and free trade in china there is a perception that the us is trying to curb its rise as a global economic power so far the us has slapped tariffs on us 550 billion worth of chinese products china in turn has set tariffs on us 185 billion worth of us goods both sides have also threatened qualitative measures that could affect us businesses operating in china it is to be noted that the two countries share 660 billion in trade between them according to the us census bureau negotiations are ongoing but settlement seems remote with neither trump nor china s president xi jinping willing to back down it seems the trade war is way far from its conclusion the competition between china and the us has been going on for years it did not begin with trump it has come to the front because china s gross domestic product shot up from only 20 percent of the us gdp in 2000 to about two thirds in 2018 and may catch up sometime in the 2030s if current trends continue moreover one of the grievances that the us has is it has not benefited enough from china us economic relations china has been able to lift 600 million of its citizens out of poverty initially through the vast expansion of export oriented jobs american consumers have also benefited from two decades of low prices but not as much as china ripple effects the prolonged trade war is going to have long lasting consequences for the world economy the financial times claims that the global trade contracted in the first seven months in 2019 as political uncertainties intensified and the us china trade war became more disruptive in the first seven months the us japan central and eastern europe as well as the middle east and north africa all reported an annual contraction in exports the euro zone reported no growth this puts enormous achievements of the last decades at severe risk in the short run tariffs are supposed to give a competitive advantage to domestic producers lowering their product prices by comparison as a result they would receive more orders growing their business and adding more jobs china does have some advantages too one is the structure of its economy dominated by state enterprises the majority of banks in china are also state owned making it easy for the government to generate a surge of cheap credit and the subsequent investment that boosts growth the second advantage is the structure of china s political system china could also further cheapen the value of its currency to offset us tariffs theoretically china can stimulate a flagging economy by ordering a burst of investment that boosts gross domestic product growth in the short term but this would probably generate more bad loans in an already fragile banking system on the other hand some analysts say that the united states is in a good position to make up for the misguided policies of the past which resulted in millions of lost jobs and thousands of shuttered factories as an immediate result the stock market and the currency value have increased in the us while the unemployment rate has gone all time low the us goods deficit with china has shrunk 11 percent for january july 2019 versus the same period in 2018 this means the us is on track to experience its smallest goods trade balance with china since 2012 however global growth in trade is lagging behind general economic growth for the first time in decades the united nations conference on trade and development unctad released a study trade and trade diversion effects of united states tariffs on china according to which the biggest fallout of the trade war has been the trade diversion effect trade being diverted to other countries to fill the vacuum left by the absence of chinese exports to the american market in the medium run it is sure that both the countries as well as the whole world will suffer the trade war between china and the united states could cost an increasingly fractured global economy about us 700 billion or 0 8 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 according to kristalina georgieva international monetary fund chief more than two thirds of the consumer goods the united states imports from china now face higher taxes the us administration had largely avoided hitting consumer items in its earlier rounds of tariff hikes but with prices of many retail goods now likely to rise the trump administration s move threatens the us economy s main driver consumer spending impact on nepal the trade war between the two largest economies of the world could have an adverse impact on the exports of the developing and also the least developed countries ldcs like nepal nepal has been granted tariff free quota free facility to export to the united states under the generalized system of preference facility similarly china has granted duty free quota free facility to 8 030 products for ldcs like nepal as china and the us are in the loggerheads to raise tariff and discourage imports from each other nepal having a weak export base and being granted duty free quota free access to various exports is still to feel the brunt of this war however as the us dollar rises in value our imports have skyrocketed and the rise in value of remittance due to rise in the usd can t be considered sustainable petrol gold and other luxurious items have been dearer due to this war and it will have a bad impact in our purchasing power as many other nations have been able to exploit this trade war as the us and china look other areas to balance their international business and economy nepal can strengthen internally and promote comparatively advantageous products to these country as much as possible though the volume will remain negligible for these giants nepal has high trade concentration with india and the united states and china both have not increased duty on imports from india nepal s trade dependence with india is rising as 66 percent of total imports and 57 percent of exports take place with india so nepal can only hope to end this war soon as the global economic slowdown will surely have impact on nepal and other poor countries in the long run the author is a section officer with ministry of foreign

e ver since the dollar cemented its role as the world s dominant currency in the 1950s it has been clear that america s position as the sole financial superpower gives it extraordinary influence over other countries economic destinies but it is only under president donald trump that america has used its powers routinely and to their full extent by engaging in financial warfare the results have been awe inspiring and shocking they have in turn prompted other countries to seek to break free of american financial hegemony listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element in 2018 america s treasury put legal measures in place that prevented rusal a strategically important russian aluminium firm from freely accessing the dollar based financial system with devastating effect overnight it was unable to deal with many counterparties western clearing houses refused to settle its debt securities the price of its bonds collapsed the restrictions were later lifted america now has over 30 active financial and trade sanctions programmes on january 10th it announced measures that the treasury secretary steven mnuchin said would cut off billions of dollars of support to the iranian regime the state department meanwhile said that iraq could lose access to its government account at the federal reserve bank of new york that would restrict iraq s use of oil revenues causing a cash crunch and flattening its economy america is uniquely well positioned to use financial warfare in the service of foreign policy the dollar is used globally as a unit of account store of value and medium of exchange at least half of cross border trade invoices are in dollars that is five times america s share of world goods imports and three times its share of exports the dollar is the preferred currency of central banks and capital markets accounting for close to two thirds of global securities issuance and foreign exchange reserves the world s financial rhythm is american when interest rates move or risk appetite on wall street shifts global markets respond the world s financial plumbing has uncle sam s imprint on it too most international transactions are ultimately cleared in dollars through new york by american correspondent banks america has a tight grip on the main cross border messaging system used by banks swift whose members ping each other 30m times a day another part of the us centric network is chips a clearing house that processes 1 5trn worth of payments daily america uses these systems to monitor activity denied access to this infrastructure an organisation becomes isolated and usually financially crippled individuals and institutions across the planet are thus subject to american jurisdiction and vulnerable to punishment america began to flex its financial muscles after the terrorist attacks of september 11th 2001 it imposed huge fines on foreign banks for money laundering and sanctions busting in 2014 a 9bn penalty against bnp paribas shook the french establishment mr trump has taken the weaponisation of finance to a new level see chart he has used sanctions to throttle iran north korea russia turkey briefly venezuela and others his arsenal also includes tariffs and legal assaults on companies most strikingly huawei which mr trump accuses of spying for china secondary sanctions target other countries companies that trade with blacklisted states after america pulled out of a nuclear deal with iran in 2018 european firms fled iran even as the eu encouraged them to stay swift quickly fell into line when america threatened action if it did not cut off iranian banks after the reimposition of sanctions in 2018 using the dollar to extend the reach of american law and policy fits mr trump s america first credo other countries view it as an abuse of power that includes adversaries such as china and russia russia s president vladimir putin talks of the dollar being used as a political weapon and it includes allies such as britain and france who worry that mr trump risks undermining america s role as guarantor of orderliness in global commerce it may eventually lead to the demise of america s financial hegemony as other countries seek to dethrone its mighty currency the new age of international monetary experimentation features the de dollarisation of assets trade workarounds using local currencies and swaps and new bank to bank payment mechanisms and digital currencies in june the chinese and russian presidents said they would expand settlement of bilateral trade in their own currencies on the sidelines of a recent summit leaders from iran malaysia turkey and qatar proposed using cryptocurrencies national currencies gold and barter for trade such activity marks an inflection point says tom keatinge of rusi a think tank countries that used merely to gripe about america s financial might are now pushing back russia has gone furthest it has designated expendable entities to engage in commerce with countries america considers rogue in order to avoid putting important banks and firms at risk state backed promsvyazbank pjsc is used for trade in arms so as to shield bigger banks like sberbank and vtb from the threat of sanctions russia has also been busy de dollarising parts of its financial system since 2013 its central bank has cut the dollar share of its foreign exchange reserves from over 40 to 24 since 2018 the bank s holdings of american treasury debt have fallen from nearly 100bn to under 10bn russia s finance ministry recently announced plans to lower the dollar share of its 125bn sovereign wealth fund we aren t aiming to ditch the dollar mr putin has said the dollar is ditching us elvira nabiullina russia s central bank governor says the move was partly motivated by american sanctions which were imposed after russia s annexation of crimea in 2014 but also by a desire to diversify currency risk i see a global shift in mood she says we are gradually moving towards a more multi currency international monetary system ms nabiullina echoes mark carney the governor of the bank of england who said in august that the dollar centric system won t hold russia s debt is being de dollarised too new issuance is often in roubles or euros and the government is exploring selling yuan denominated bonds russian companies have shrunk their foreign debts by 260bn since 2014 of that 200bn was dollar denominated conversely russian firms and households retain a fondness for dollars when it comes to holding international assets they have 80bn more than they did in 2014 dmitry dolgin of ing a bank finds this puzzling but suspects it could be that the interest rates on dollar assets higher than on euro equivalents outweigh the perceived risk from sanctions dasvidaniya dollar ing expects 62 of russia s goods and services exports to have been settled in dollars in 2019 down from 80 in 2013 its trade with china was almost all in dollars in 2013 now less than half is trade with india much of it in the sanctions sensitive defence sector shifted from almost all dollars to almost all roubles over that period one reason for this shift say russian officials is that it speeds trade up since dollar payments can be delayed for weeks as financial intermediaries run sanctions checks energy and commodities firms are among russia s most active de dollarisers the greenback is the global benchmark currency for oil trading and escaping its grip is hard the key thing to understand is that risk management the entire derivatives complex is in dollars explains the boss of a global energy firm so if you want to have risk management as an oil trader buyer or producer you have to have contact with the dollar system nonetheless rosneft a state backed producer that accounts for over 40 of russia s crude output has denominated its tender contracts in euros surgutneftegas another producer still prices in dollars but has added a clause to contracts saying they can be switched to euros at its request a back up plan in case trump throws shit at the fan says a trader last march gazprom priced a natural gas shipment to western europe in roubles for the first time the cost of switching out of dollars is modest says an executive at a global oil trading firm an extra person in the finance department and a bit more currency risk will china follow the trail blazed by russia mr trump has exposed china s profound vulnerability to the dollar centric financial system america s ability to blacklist or hobble chinese tech firms such as huawei ultimately rests on punishing suppliers and other counterparties who do business with them through the dollar based banking and payments system an american legal case against a senior huawei executive who is fighting extradition from canada reportedly relies in part on evidence from an american appointed overseer at hsbc an asia centric bank run from london in october america sanctioned eight cutting edge chinese tech firms for alleged human rights abuses in xinjiang province the administration has threatened to block listings by chinese firms in new york and restrict purchases by american investors of chinese shares china s first attempt to bypass the dollar was bungled after the financial crisis in 2007 09 it promoted the international use of the yuan and pressed for it to become part of the imf s special drawing rights in effect receiving the fund s imprimatur as a reserve currency china set up currency swap deals with foreign central banks it has done over 35 there was heady talk of the yuan challenging the dollar for the top spot by 2020 then came a stockmarket panic in 2015 and the government clumsily tightened capital controls the yuan s share of global payment by value has stayed at about 2 for several years zhou xiaochuan a former governor of china s central bank has said that yuan internationalisation which he promoted while in office was a premature baby america s display of financial firepower and new technologies are changing the calculus again china has some of the building blocks to become more autonomous it has its own domestic payments and settlement infrastructure called cips launched in 2015 it has so far complemented swift which it uses for interbank messaging it is tiny processing less in 2018 than swift does each day but it simplifies cross border payments in yuan giving banks lots of nodes for settlements reports suggest that china india and others may be exploring a jointly run swift alternative a will and a huawei parts of the world s consumer finance system are coming under china s sway thanks to its digital platform firms which have globalised faster than its conventional banks payments through alibaba and its affiliate ant financial are accepted by merchants in 56 countries the alipay logo is in some places as common as visa s in capital markets in 2018 china introduced a yuan denominated crude oil futures contract on a shanghai exchange known as the petroyuan it is seen by some as a potential rival to the dollar in pricing oil china has encouraged important firms listed in america to list their shares closer to home as well on november 26th alibaba china s most valuable company which in 2014 floated in new york rather than in hong kong or shanghai completed a 13 4bn additional listing in hong kong the funds were raised in hong kong dollars as a result of the continuous innovation and changes to the hong kong capital market we are able to realise what we regrettably missed out on five years ago said daniel zhang alibaba s chief executive china s central bank is reported to be working on a new digital currency though details are sparse some speculate that it wants to get a head start on america in building whatever international system emerges for managing payments in central bank issued digital currencies it discussed creating a common cryptocurrency with other brics countries brazil russia india and south africa at a recent summit china may end up doing bitcoin with an authoritarian twist instead of anonymity it may want all data to be trackable and centrally stored that america s geopolitical rivals want to escape the dollar s dominance is no surprise perhaps more striking is that its allies are flirting with it too in her manifesto for 2019 24 ursula von der leyen the new president of the european commission said i want to strengthen the international role of the euro jean claude juncker her predecessor has called the dollar s dominance in european energy trade an aberration when just 2 of imports come from america the commission is working on a new action plan part of which involves encouraging eu countries to eliminate undue reference to the dollar in payments and trade invoicing according to a staffer so far the eu s main initiative has involved iran it has tried to create a way for its banks and firms to trade with it while shielding them from america s wrath but instex a clearing house created for this purpose by britain france and germany with the commission s support is crude and limited it is essentially a barter mechanism and does not cover oil sales it is limited to non sanctioned humanitarian trade it was structured to allow firms to engage in commerce without resort to the dollar or swift but they have stayed away for fear of incurring secondary sanctions the stuttering performance of instex reflects the sheer scope of america s reach as adam m smith a sanctions expert at gibson dunn a law firm points out america can claim jurisdiction if a transaction has any american nexus even if it is not denominated in dollars this includes transactions that rely on banks under american jurisdiction or where a foreign counterparty relies on american nationals to approve facilitate or process the transaction or where one party uses a back end payment accounting or email system that is stored on servers in america despite this some european officials remain optimistic on november 29th six more eu states said they planned to join instex it s a ten to twenty year thing and hopefully not only covering iran you can t undo decades of policy in a year says a french official and if europe manages to reform the inner workings of the euro its financial reach will expand we need to complete the project first banking union fiscal integration genuine capital markets union and so on another french official says european powers are likely to play a leading role in central bank efforts to create a global electronic currency last year mr carney floated the idea of a network of central bank digital monies that could serve as a global invoicing currency if it happens america may not be invited a haven above the true test of any reserve currency is a financial crisis eswar prasad of cornell university the author of the dollar trap notes that the greenback benefits during times of turmoil the 2007 09 crisis which originated in america paradoxically strengthened its status as a safe haven when global trade saving borrowing and reserves are largely in one currency these strengths are mutually reinforcing no other capital market comes close to america s for depth and liquidity a key factor when choosing a currency for commerce

signed a deal that will roll back some tariffs and see china boost purchases of u s goods and services by 200 billion over two years whether somebody looks at this as big progress or little progress it is something tangible and so the arrow is pointing in a direction that the market is comfortable with said chuck carlson chief executive officer of horizon investment services at hammond indiana in the united states the phase 1 deal however does not fully eliminate the tariffs while the 200 billion purchase targets which include energy farm and manufacturing products look daunting to achieve nor does it address structural economic issues that led to the trade conflict officials say these will be dealt in phase 2 negotiations though the differences there are so fundamental that many investors doubt whether any deal will come through u s china tensions go beyond trade and will remain even after the phase 1 deal signing and during the phase 2 negotiations and may accelerate after the u s election said economists at citigroup global markets the deal s enforcement mechanism allowing unilateral actions essentially implies the risk of a snapback of u s tariffs or china s commitments they

one fine day in october 2014 kenyans were just going about their business when unexpected news came in without their having to break a sweat every kenyan was declared richer by the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs each citizen saw their income per year jump by sh26 200 after the size of the country s economy was re assessed to include new sectors as a result gross domestic product gdp the sum of all the goods and services produced in the country expanded by 25 per cent kenya joined a club of not so rich but not so poor countries known as lower middle income countries lmics kenya leapfrogged ethiopia and ghana to become the fifth largest economy in sub saharan africa behind nigeria south africa angola and sudan unfortunately kenyans newfound income which economists describe as gdp per capita existed only on paper they did not get new jobs better salaries or additional plates of ugali but in one fell swoop that day in october redefined kenya s economic landscape and five years later kenyans on twitter refer to that re evaluation of their economy with the phrase vitu kwa ground ni different what was on paper never quite translated into reality the country further found itself missing out on cheap loans from bretton woods institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf because well they were rich enough to afford the more expensive loans expensive loans however while the expensive loans from banks and international capital markets have led to more roads bridges airports and railways the economic returns from this infrastructure has not come in as fast as repayment dates between 2010 and 2015 the country s budget deficit the difference between the money it spends and the money it raises through taxes was among the lowest in africa at 1 9 per cent of gdp in fact compared to other sub saharan africa countries kenya s budget deficit placed it at position 14 the rebasing also meant the fraction of public debt to gdp dropped giving the government more room to borrow by 2017 the country s ravenous appetite for debt and its redefined borrowing avenues saw the budget deficit rise to 7 9 per cent of gdp this created a vicious borrowing cycle as the deficit had to be plugged through loans expensive loans with prohibitive interest rates short grace periods and even shorter repayment periods kenyans started working for creditors in the year to june 2019 for every sh100 the country earned from taxes non tax revenues and grants from donors sh57 went into servicing debt six years ago the treasury would pay out sh25 from every sh100 earned imf which in 2018 noted that kenya s probability of defaulting had increased from low to moderate said interest payments on the public debt increased to almost one fifth of the country s revenue putting it among the top five frontier economies this was due to the accumulation of expensive loans including over sh500 billion in eurobonds which is debt borrowed from international markets and denominated in dollars the result has been that the government is looking to deeply cut its spending but these austerity measures threaten to reduce the circulation of money in an economy facing a cash crunch that has seen companies fire workers due to erratic incomes gdp has increasingly featured in headlines but tends to seem so far removed from reality that it has given rise to a new kenyan proverb you can t eat gdp president uhuru kenyatta himself has commented on the country s meteoric gdp growth in his 2016 state of the nation address he acknowledged that ordinary kenyans cannot relate to such colourful economic indicators wananchi want to know what these economic indicators mean to their lives they cannot relate to how gdp impacts on the price of unga many of our citizens are wondering why their children are still struggling to find jobs these concerns are legitimate and they are questions that every citizen is entitled to have answers from their government said mr kenyatta private investment the narrative has since been picked up by economists like central bank of kenya cbk governor patrick njoroge who took on the pitfalls of infrastructure driven growth it is true you have gdp numbers but you can t eat gdp he said gdp as a measure of a country s well being has been heavily criticised for its many gaps yet its relevance has not diminished since 1937 when american economist simon kuznets came up with the indicator the united nations came up with the human development index hdi in one of the many attempts to cure the problem of gdp hdi takes into account indicators like the happiness of a population how long one lives standards of living and levels of knowledge while on gdp lists kenya sits below eight african countries it lags behind 15 when it comes to hdi an indictment of the government s policy priorities kenyans are poorer in terms of human development when compared to their lmic peers while it might appear unfair to compare kenya s poverty levels with some of the other countries considered lower middle income a 2018 world bank report compared kenya to its peer ghana and the results were disheartening the poverty headcount in ghana at the lmic line 34 9 per cent is 28 8 percentage points less than that in kenya kenya s depth of poverty at the lmic line is substantially higher than ghana and the lmic aggregate noted the report the question on growth figures is if the economy churned out more healthcare services legal services newspapers fruit juices skyscrapers tables loaves of bread and beers who would have produced these how many people would be involved and did they earn more for their labour the verdict has largely been brutal with experts pointing out that with jobs and wages failing to grow gdp figures are not living up to the promise as dr njoroge puts it infrastructure driven growth does not trickle down to the majority the private sector made up of households and businesses is the proverbial goose that lays the golden eggs eight in 10 people are employed in the private sector it is this sector that pays taxes yet its contribution to the economy has been declining the contribution from private investment has been negative in recent years declining from 1 3 percentage points of gdp in the four years leading to 2013 to 0 3 percentage points in the four years leading to 2017 read a world bank report on private capital in kenya the nairobi securities exchange nse an arena for commercial activities continues to experience a listing drought even as several businesses that went public either register losses or sharp profit drops the benchmark nse 20 share index which closed yesterday at 2 669 23 points has gradually fallen from an all time high of 6 161 46 in january 2007 few counters outside of safaricom and banks experience activity two of the sectors that have taken a plunge include the agriculture and manufacturing sectors as agricultural productivity has dwindled kenya has increasingly turned overseas to feed itself as a share of total imports food imports have increased from seven per cent in 2008 to 10 per cent in 2017 according to figures from the food and agriculture organisation fao kenya s poorer neighbours like uganda ethiopia tanzania and rwanda have a lower cereal imports dependency ratio meaning most of the maize wheat rice and other cereals that they consume are produced locally except for animal products and potatoes kenya has had to import nearly all the other food crops to supplement depressed local production according to official data agriculture is not only the largest economic sector but it is also the largest employer with one in six kenyans engaged in either crop farming or rearing of livestock the second largest employer is the manufacturing sector unfortunately its contribution to gdp has been shrinking with firms spooked by a crippling cost of production to create more jobs uhuru wants the share of manufacturing to gdp to inch up to 15 per cent by 2022 however two years after the government outlined its agenda of increasing value addition manufacturing as a percentage of gdp stands at 7 6 per cent as of june 2019 further even as more goods and services were produced a typical employee s wages adjusted for the increase in the cost of living remained stagnant minimum wage wages economists say tend to be sticky ideally if you are running a business and realise that your costs of production have gone up you need to slash them to remain in the business however due to contracts and distortions such as minimum wage legislation from labour unions a business cannot simply cut employee salaries as part of its cost cutting measures as a result says scholastica odhiambo an economics lecturer at maseno university wages have remained stuck even as gdp has grown to reduce costs most businesses over the last 10 years have opted to remain informal no labour unions no pension no medical cover for employees no permanent structure indeed nine out of 10 employees in kenya make a living from the informal sector which is characterised by low wages we have to be concerned with the growth of informal jobs and decline in real wages relative to exponential growth in real gdp says dr odhiambo gerrishon ikiara an economics lecturer at the university of nairobi however says the depressed wages might also be a pointer to employers having more bargaining power

the low cost fekola mine is forecast to produce between 590 000 and 620 000 ounces of gold in 2020 a significant increase of 33 approximately 150 000 ounces over 2019 gold production is forecast to be marginally weighted to the second half of the year 52 and be relatively consistent throughout the year even though the expansion of the fekola processing plant is not scheduled to be completed until the end of the third quarter of 2020 the consistent production throughout the year is mainly due to the expansion of the fekola mining fleet and optimization of the mining sequence early in the year which will provide access to higher grade portions of the deposit earlier on in the sequence when the mill expansion comes into service lower grade ore is expected to be processed rather than being stockpiled during the second half of the year with the significant increase in gold production forecast for 2020 as well as the planned impact of the new fekola solar plant once construction is completed fekola s cash operating costs are forecast to significantly decline and be between 285 and 325 per ounce approximately 22 below its 2019 guidance range of between 370 and 410 per ounce fekola s aisc are also forecast to decline and be between 555 and 595 per ounce approximately 11 below its 2019 guidance range of between 625 and 665 per ounce in 2020 the fekola mine is budgeted to

the low cost fekola mine is forecast to produce between 590 000 and 620 000 ounces of gold in 2020 a significant increase of 33 approximately 150 000 ounces over 2019 gold production is forecast to be marginally weighted to the second half of the year 52 and be relatively consistent throughout the year even though the expansion of the fekola processing plant is not scheduled to be completed until the end of the third quarter of 2020 the consistent production throughout the year is mainly due to the expansion of the fekola mining fleet and optimization of the mining sequence early in the year which will provide access to higher grade portions of the deposit earlier on in the sequence when the mill expansion comes into service lower grade ore is expected to be processed rather than being stockpiled during the second half of the year with the significant increase in gold production forecast for 2020 as well as the planned impact of the new fekola solar plant once construction is

authored by lance roberts via realinvestmentadvice com john mauldin recently penned an interesting piece ignoring problems rarely solves them you need to deal with them not just the effects but the underlying causes or else they usually get worse in the developed world and especially the us and even in china our economic challenges are rapidly approaching that point things that would have been easily fixed a decade ago or even five years ago will soon be unsolvable by conventional means yes we did indeed need the federal reserve to provide liquidity during the initial crisis but after that the fed kept rates too low for too long reinforcing the wealth and income disparities and creating new bubbles we will have to deal with in the not too distant future this wasn t a beautiful deleveraging as you call it it was the ugly creation of bubbles and misallocation of capital the fed shouldn t have blown these bubbles in the first place john is correct the problem with low interest rates for so long is they have encouraged the misallocation of capital we see it everywhere throughout the entirety of the financial system from consumer debt to subprime auto loans to corporate leverage and speculative greed misallocation of capital everywhere debt if used for productive purposes can be beneficial however as discussed in the economy should grow faster than debt since the bulk of the debt issued by the u s has been squandered on increases in social welfare programs and debt service there is a negative return on investment therefore the larger the balance of debt becomes the more economically destructive it is by diverting an ever growing amount of dollars away from productive investments to service payments currently throughout the entire monetary ecosystem there is a rising consensus that debt doesn t matter as long as interest rates and inflation remain low of course the ultra low interest rate policy administered by the federal reserve is responsible for the yield chase and the massive surge in debt since the financial crisis yes current economic growth is good but not great inflation and interest rates remain low which creates an illusion that using debt remains opportunistic however as stated rising levels of non productive debt has negative long term economic consequences before the deregulation of the financial industry under president reagan which led to an explosion in consumer credit issuance it required just 1 00 of total system wide debt to create 1 00 of economic growth today it requires 3 97 to create the same 1 of economic growth this shouldn t be surprising given that debt detracts from economic growth as the debt service diverts income from productive investments and leads to a diminishing rate of return for each new dollar of debt the irony is that while it appears the economy is growing akin to the analogy of boiling a frog we accept 2 economic growth as strong whereas such growth rates were previously considered near recessionary another conundrum is that corporations and financial institutions appear to be healthier not to mention wealthier than ever if such is indeed the case then why is the federal reserve still needing to engage in emergency monetary measures to support the financial markets and economy after more than a decade as john stated above the fed s actions are only ignoring the problems which combined is a problem too large for the federal reserve to fix the dark side of stock buybacks while many argue that share buybacks are just a method by which corporations can return cash to shareholders there is a dark side in moderation repurchases can be a beneficial method for a company to deploy capital when no better options are available it s the least best use of cash but as with everything in life when taken to excess the beneficial effects can become detrimental the rules now reward management not for generating revenue but to drive up the price of the share price thus making their options and stock grants more valuable john mauldin the problem for the fed was despite the best of intentions lowering interest rates to zero did not spark a bank lending spree throughout the economy instead the excess liquidity flowed directly back into the financial system creating a global wealth gap rather than supporting stronger economic growth the most vivid example of this closed loop was in corporate share repurchases corporations able to borrow cheaply due to low rates used debt and cash to repurchase shares to increase earnings per share this was the easiest route to create executive wealth rather than deploying capital in more risky endeavors as the financial times penned corporate executives give several reasons for stock buybacks but none of them has close to the explanatory power of this simple truth stock based instruments make up the majority of their pay and in the short term buybacks drive up stock prices importantly as noted by the securities exchange commission sec research found that many corporate executives sell significant amounts of their own shares after their companies announce stock buybacks again buybacks may not be an issue but when taken to excess such can have the negative side effects of inflating asset bubbles as john authers pointed out we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us for much of the last decade companies buying their own shares have accounted for all net purchases the total amount of stock bought back by companies since the 2008 crisis even exceeds the federal reserve s spending on buying bonds over the same period as part of quantitative easing both pushed up asset prices stock buybacks are only a short term benefit with liquid cash or worse debt used for a one time benefit there is a long term negative return on uses of capital for non productive investments all levered up currently total corporate debt has surged to 10 1 trillion its highest level relative to u s gdp 47 since the financial crisis in just the last two years corporations have issued another 1 2 trillion of new debt not for expansion but primarily used for share buybacks for the last 10 years the fed s zero interest rate policy has left investors chasing yield and corporations were glad to oblige the end result is the risk premium for owning corporate bonds over u s treasuries is at historic lows and debt has allowed many zombie companies to remain alive during the next market reversion the 10 year rate will fall towards zero as money seeks the stability and safety of the u s treasury bond however corporate bonds will be decimated when high yield or junk bonds begin to default in large numbers as they always do in a recession which is why they are called junk bonds investors will face sharp losses on the one side of their portfolio they thought was safe as the credit market falls into crisis the fed will have to ramp up additional stimulus to bail out the financial institutions caught long with an exceeding amount of poor quality debt as shown below treasuries will gain a bid as yields fall to zero while corporate bonds lose value in just the last 10 years the triple b bond market has exploded from 686 billion to 2 5 trillion an all time high to put that in perspective 50 of the investment grade bond market now sits on the lowest rung of the quality ladder and there s a reason bbb rated debt is so plentiful ultra low interest rates have seduced companies to pile into the bond market and corporate debt has surged to heights not seen since the global financial crisis john mauldin as noted previously there is a large tranche of bbb bonds on the verge of being downgraded to junk when this occurs there will be an avalanche of selling as pension mutual and hedge fund managers dump bonds simultaneously into what will be an illiquid market pensions are broke but it is not just share buybacks and debt which are problems hiding in plain sight moody s investor service estimated last year that the total pension funding gap in the u s is 4 4 trillion a few months ago the american legislative exchange council estimated it at nearly 6 trillion with pension funds already wrestling with largely underfunded liabilities the aging demographics are further complicating funding problems the 6 trillion pension crisis is just one sharp market downturn away from imploding as i wrote in the next financial crisis will be the last the real crisis comes when there is a run on pensions with a large number of pensioners already eligible for their pension the next decline in the markets will likely spur the fear that benefits will be lost entirely the combined run on the system which is grossly underfunded at a time when asset prices are declining will cause a debacle of mass proportions it will require a massive government bailout to resolve it this 6 trillion hit is going to come at a time where the federal reserve will already be at full tilt monetizing debt to stabilize declining financial markets to keep a debt crisis from spreading strike three you re out while investors have become extremely complacent over the last decade that central banks have gained control of the financial markets this is likely an illusion there are numerous catalysts which could pressure a downturn in the equity markets an exogenous geopolitical event a credit related event failure of a major financial institution recession falling profits and earnings a loss of confidence by corporations which contacts share buybacks whatever the event is which is currently unexpected and unanticipated the decline in asset prices will initiate a chain reaction investors will begin to panic as asset prices drop curtailing economic activity and further pressuring economic growth the pressure on asset prices and weaker economic growth which impairs corporate earnings shifts corporate views from share repurchases to liquidity preservation this removes a major support of asset prices as asset prices decline further and economic growth deteriorates credit defaults begin triggering a near 5 trillion corporate bond market problem the bond market decline will pressure asset prices lower which triggers an aging demographic who fears the loss of pension benefits sparks the 6 trillion pension problem as the market continues to cascade lower at this point the fed is monetizing nearly 100 of all debt issuance and has to resort to even more drastic measures to stem selling and defaults those actions lead to a further loss of confidence and pressures markets even further the federal reserve can not fix this problem and the next bear market will not be like that last it will be worse as john concluded coordinated monetary policy is the problem not the solution and while i have little hope for change in that regard i have no hope that monetary policy will rescue us from the next crisis let me amplify that last line not only is there no hope monetary policy will save us from the next crisis it will help cause the next crisis the process has already begun john mauldin

the low cost fekola mine is forecast to produce between 590 000 and 620 000 ounces of gold in 2020 a significant increase of 33 approximately 150 000 ounces over 2019 gold production is forecast to be marginally weighted to the second half of the year 52 and be relatively consistent throughout the year even though the expansion of the fekola processing plant is not scheduled to be completed until the end of the third quarter of 2020 the consistent production throughout the year is mainly due to the expansion of the fekola mining fleet and optimization of the mining sequence early in the year which will provide access to higher grade portions of the deposit earlier on in the sequence when the mill expansion comes into service lower grade ore is expected to be processed rather than being stockpiled during the second half of the year with the significant increase in gold production forecast for 2020 as well as the planned impact of the new fekola solar plant once construction is

the dow jones industrial average climbed to fresh record highs while the us dollar rose to its strongest level in 8 months against the japanese yen on the back of stronger retail sales after weeks of disappointing economic reports investors wanted to see data validate the rallies so they jumped on the report when it released driving equities and currencies higher is the us economy out of the woods certainly not but given how the market shrugged off softer releases like non farm payrolls and cpi a strong report was bound to have a bigger impact on the greenback than a weak one despite slower wage growth consumer spending rose 0 3 in the month of december this was in line but excluding autos and gas spending rose 0 5 at the end of the year and manufacturing activity in the philadelphia region recovered strongly at the start of the year however as encouraging as that may be its also important to acknowledge the downward revision to the core numbers in november and the sluggish holiday sales numbers reported by target yesterday spending in december may have been healthy but 2020 could be a challenge for retailers alike yet us policymakers remain optimistic with fed presidents kashkari kaplan and bowman expounding the positive outlook of the labor and housing market the white house also teased the possibility of a tax cut which helps the rally the phase 1 china us trade deal is also done and while its lacking in many ways the hope is that trade tensions won t be an issue for the next few months tomorrow s housing and consumer confidence numbers are not expected to have a dramatic impact on the market but the relationship with iran leaves the risk to the downside for sentiment one of the best performing currencies today was sterling and its strength is surprising given recent data and the talk of a rate cut this year sterling edged higher for the third day in a row and the only explanation is optimism ahead of the december retail sales report according to the british retail consortium demand was strong but that does not diminish the weakness that we ve seen in industrial production and inflation uk prime minister boris johnson also admitted that they may not be able to reach a trade deal with the eu this year none of this is good for the uk and as things stand rate cuts will certainly be on the minds of uk central bankers euro pulled back after the ecb minutes from the december meeting revealed that policy could be adjusted to reduce unwanted side effects however with a solid upward trend in underlying inflation ex holiday costs eurozone policymakers are in no rush to ease compared to other countries we continue to see stabilization and improvement in the economy the canadian and australian dollars also lost value despite stronger australian housing data this week despite the more than 1 rise in oil prices and stronger us data the rally in usd cad is losing momentum there s no specific explanation for the underperformance in aud today outside of the broader us dollar rally but chinese gdp industrial production and retail sales numbers are scheduled for release and investors could be worried about the results in contrast the best performing currency today was the new zealand dollar nzd shrugged off unexpectedly weak credit card spending numbers rising in favor of stronger house sales manufacturing pmi numbers are scheduled for release this afternoon and given the recent trend of data an uptick is expected

employees eligible for recall are now back to work also last year we completed the divestiture of the historically unprofitable aviles and la coruna smelters in spain after reaching an agreement with the workers representatives at these two facilities in november we also implemented our new operating model for a leaner company which will provide annual savings beginning in the second quarter of this year finally in our markets 2019 ended in a global deficit for aluminum and surpluses in bauxite and alumina we see slight surpluses ahead in 2020 for bauxite and alumina and a balanced market for aluminum we ll discuss more on the markets and these other topics after bill provides a detailed review of the results so with that i ll turn it over to bill william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy reviewing our income statement revenues were down 131 million or 5 sequentially due to lower realized prices for alumina and aluminum partially offset by improved volumes year over year revenues declined 908 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 again on lower alumina and aluminum prices in the quarter restructuring charges drove the net loss attributable to alcoa corporation of 303 million or 1 63 per share on a 185 6 million average shares for the quarter special items in the fourth quarter totaled 246 million after tax and non controlling interests the key components this quarter were the 274 million charge related to the closing of our point comfort texas alumina refinery 75 million related to pension and opeb changes and 23 million of becancour restart costs partially offset by non controlling interest and favorable interim tax impacts now let s look at the income statement excluding special items our fourth quarter adjusted net loss excluding special items was 57 million or 0 31 per share adjusted ebitda excluding special items was 346 million our fourth quarter ebitda margin was 14 2 the full year operational tax rate ended the year at 67 9 the higher annual rate required true up of prior periods in the fourth quarter adding 28 million to the expense or 0 15 per share and brought the operational rate for the quarter to 99 5 let s look closer at factors driving adjusted ebitda this quarter lower raw materials costs partially offset the impact of lower alumina and aluminum prices lower market prices for alumina and aluminum drove adjusted ebitda down 77 million and 23 million respectively taken together all other impacts improved 58 million sequentially partially offsetting the price impact raw material costs primarily for carbon at the smelters and cost to get the refineries continued their improvement but were partially offset by higher production costs at mines and smelters inter segment eliminations drove the change in other category as lower alumina prices changes in refinery cost structures and lower alumina inventories released profit held in inventory now let s move to the segments in the segments bauxite adjusted ebitda continued near its record high level at 42 ebitda margin alumina adjusted ebitda declined 90 million on lower sales prices aluminum adjusted ebitda improved 32 million sequentially on better alumina costs partially offset by lower aluminum prices and lower value added product premiums non segment impacts contributed 6 million 18 million better than last quarter inter segment eliminations were favorable 15 million and other corporate costs improved 3 million turning to cash in the fourth quarter we ended the year with cash of 879 million up 38 million sequentially year over year cash declined 234 million a quick review of our major cash sources and uses for 2019 our total cash sources were 2 billion consisting of 1 7 billion in adjusted ebitda and approximately 300 million sourced from changes in working capital the largest outflows of cash were tax payments including 351 million in payments of prior year income tax net distributions to our joint venture minority interest partner of 421 million 379 million of capital expenditures as well as 240 million of required pension and post employment benefits funding made an addition to the 52 million related expenses with an adjusted ebitda outflows also included 220 million in restructuring payments primarily the saudi rolling mill and spanish smelter divestitures now let s take a look at the balance sheet our balance sheet remains strong and reflects solid management in 2019 our fourth quarter days working capital was 27 days down three days sequentially and even with last year s fourth quarter we controlled total capital spending to 379 million a level 20 million lower than in 2018 our key balance sheet metric proportional adjusted net debt increased 135 million from last year primarily due to a lower cash ending balance at year end our consolidated pension and opeb net liability rounded up to 2 4 billion up only 40 million year over year in spite of lower discount rates increasing the net liability by approximately 600 million global pension asset returns were approximately 17 and actions taken to manage the pension and opeb liabilities offset the increase related to the discount rate now let s move to our outlook for 2020 first let s look at the income statement impacts we expect shipments to increase year over year in all three product segments as existing facilities creep production in bauxite and alumina and in aluminum our becancour restart ramps up with the divestiture of the afobaka hydroelectric dam in suriname and the gum springs arkansas treatment facility and the closure of the point comfort refinery we expect transformation ebitda to be negative by approximately 85 million compared to negative 7 million in 2019 the majority of that impact is from the divestiture of the suriname dam part of the positive impact of our new operating model and overhead cost reductions can be seen in lower other corporate impacts expected to improve by roughly 13 million the remainder of the impact we expect to see in the operating segments starting in the second quarter dd a expenses also has made it to improve and we expect interest expense and our operational tax rate to be similar to 2019 levels although market conditions can greatly impact the tax rate for cash flow impacts minimum required pension and opeb funding is planned to increase roughly 100 million as historical pension asset return shortfalls are funded sustaining capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately 400 million the key reasons for the increase are mine moves willowdale mine in australia will move major infrastructure several miles to a new reserve area an elaborate process that occurs there roughly every 25 years we are also starting a mine move at juruti in brazil expected to be complete in 2021 we will target return seeking capital at 75 million prior period tax payments are expected to be roughly 300 million or lower in 2020 as alumina prices were lower in 2019 and large prior year tax true ups are not expected we expect environmental and aro payments to increase to approximately 150 million reflecting the impact of the point comfort closure as usual in the appendix we also listed additional considerations expected for the first quarter they include bauxite adjusted ebitda to be down approximately 35 million on lower sales prices and seasonal maintenance outages in alumina we expect a 5 million sequential benefit from the point comfort closure while improvements from lower bauxite energy and raw material costs will offset the unfavorable mix of sales contracts and impacts of scheduled maintenance overhauls in the aluminum segment approximately 10 million benefit from lower alumina costs compared to the fourth quarter benefits from the becancour restart and lower raw material costs are expected to be more than offset by higher energy costs in europe lower shipments of rolled products and price and mix impacts in north america yielding an expected 5 million to 10 million sequential negative impact also in the second half of the year we expect to see the impact of the higher cost natural gas contracts for our western australia refineries that we announced in 2015 and 2018 these contracts cover 90 of western australia requirements and begin in the second half of 2020 in 2015 and 2016 we made 500 million in cash pre payments related to the 2015 contracts and net of those prepayments we expect 2020 cash payments for wa gas will increase our total australian refining cash costs 2 5 or 50 million compared to 2019 so with that i ll turn it back to you roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks bill as we start the new year i d like to recap our final view of the 2019 markets and provide new estimates for 2020 in bauxite the market ended the year with a smaller surplus than we estimated in the prior quarter decreased supply from guinea largely due to rainy season supply chain disruptions in the second half of the year is the primary reason for the lower surplus for 2020 we expect the market to be in a similarly sized surplus with increased supply from guinea and australia serving demand in china where we project bauxite imports will increase by close to 20 million tons year on year chinese refiners continue to build strategic stockpiles to mitigate their supply chain risks in alumina the year also finished with a smaller market surplus than we estimated previously this revision is due primarily to some delays in chinese refinery restarts and expansion in 2020 we expect a roughly balanced market globally increased demand from chinese smelters is expected to outpace alumina supply increases as such we expect china to remain a net importer of alumina in 2020 bringing in tons from the rest of the world surplus to meet its deficit finally in the aluminum market we maintain our estimate of a full year deficit for 2019 in 2020 we expect the global market will turn to surplus driven by additional supply from smelter expansions and restarts more than offsetting modest global demand growth we expect that china will continue to be a market a surplus market and in the world ex china we expect a balanced to slightly surplus market last year we lowered our expectation for 2019 world ex china global aluminum demand growth primarily due to trade tensions lower trade volumes and declining growth in manufacturing activity most notably in europe and north america for 2020 however we are anticipating a rebound in demand growth in both world ex china and in china we expect to see a recovery in key aluminum end use sectors including such important markets as the european transport sector and the construction and transportation sectors in china in summary while 2019 s economic conditions posed real challenges to the aluminum market we are cautiously optimistic about 2020 from a return to demand growth now let s transition from the current state of our global markets to medium to long term market trends and connect these developments to the strategic programs we announced in october in bauxite china s appetite for imports is likely to continue unabated with its imports projected to double between 2018 and 2025 due to the continued depletion of its own domestic supply china is also strategically stockpiling bauxite due to concerns about supply chain risks meanwhile alcoa has ownership in seven bauxite mines globally with a first quartile cost position these assets are strategically located to supply our own top tier alumina refining system and serve the third party market as bill mentioned we are increasing capex this year to fund additional mine moves which sustained our cost position and provides continued access to our long lived bauxite reserves we can provide high quality bauxite for both our own internal refining system and to global customers which we see as a competitive advantage in alumina chinese refineries will continue to face higher costs for bauxite relative to world ex china refineries due to the higher costs associated with importing seaborne bauxite this two illustrates the advantage of the low cost position of our refining system which is fully served by our own bauxite mines and have a low cost and highly dependable supply chain looking forward the complexity in china s bauxite supply will support steepness in the global cost curve alumina is notoriously difficult and costly to inventory which tends to keep supply and demand closely linked to a market efficient and transparent pricing mechanism and the management of bauxite residue is complex and alcoa has developed and deployed market leading and cost efficient best practices and that gives alcoa another competitive advantage in this attractive market for our company finally in aluminum chinese overcapacity continues to challenge the global market in the form of increased exports of semi fabricated products or semis chinese net semis exports are projected to increase from just under 3 million tons in 2018 to over 4 million tons in 2025 the excess supply of chinese semis will be exported to the world ex china effectively displacing primary aluminum in those markets this trend of growing chinese exports competing with aluminum produced outside of china is nothing new in fact over the past five years chinese exports of aluminum semis and finished products have captured more of the ex china total aluminum consumption growth than ex china smelters did this growth has been fueled by china s unfair subsidies which were detailed in last year s report by the organization for economic cooperation and development or the oecd the report clearly demonstrates that non market forces including financial subsidies and the value added tax rebates have contributed to increases in aluminum smelting capacities and incentivized chinese exports of semis with negative impacts across the value chain as a company we support free trade but it needs to be fair that s why we are encouraged by yesterday s agreement by the trade ministers for united states the european union in japan to strengthen existing world trade organization rules on industrial subsidies which would include aluminum this is a positive sign in our continued call for governments to address unfairly subsidized overcapacity in china and to ensure a level playing field while the rise of chinese exports resulting from subsidies has become the single most important issue facing the aluminum industry we are not waiting for government action or policy changes to transform our business we are evaluating our portfolio to ensure that our locations are sustainable financially and environmentally as i said earlier today our strategic priorities will guide us to improved competitiveness with low cost operations at the end of our portfolio review we expect not only to have an improved cost position but also to lead in a world becoming even more focused on sustainably produced products in aluminum we currently hold a high second quartile position on the cost curve and once we complete the capacity review we expect to enter the first quartile from an environmental perspective we expect that our smelting portfolio s carbon dioxide intensity will improve almost 50 due to the changes that we make as part of the portfolio review today we re already one of the lowest per ton emitters of carbon dioxide among global producers and approximately 70 of our metal is produced with renewable energy and once we progressed through our portfolio review we expect to be the lowest carbon emitter with 85 of our metal produced with renewable energy we believe that this environmental footprint strengthened by our continued portfolio actions will provide a true advantage in a world focused on sustainability now let s spend a bit more time discussing our most recent actions to improve first at the top left of the chart our new operating model took effect in the fourth quarter beginning in november it is expected to result in annual savings of 60 million in operating costs beginning in the second quarter we have eliminated our prior business unit structure and consolidated our sales procurement and other commercial capabilities importantly we are bringing our operations closer to our management team enabling faster decisions also we are making quick progress in our plan to generate between 500 million and 1 billion in cash through the sale of non core assets over the next 12 months to 18 months a few weeks ago we announced an agreement to sell our gum springs waste processing facility while the team there expanded the scope of services this facility can provide it is not a core function at alcoa so we have agreed to sell the location to a global environmental firm in a transaction valued at 250 million we will receive 200 million when the transaction closes this quarter and another 50 million upon the satisfaction of post closing conditions the additional cash we generate from the sale of non core assets will assist us in our work to reshape our existing portfolio as part of that multi year portfolio review we made the decision last month to permanently close the point comfort alumina refinery in texas which has been fully curtailed since 2016 this is the first action in a five year review process which is focused on 4 million metric tons of global refining capacity or 27 of our current portfolio and 1 5 million metric tons of smelting or approximately 50 of that segment s capacity finally we marked an important milestone in suriname where we successfully completed the transfer of the afobaka hydroelectric dam to the government effective december 31 2019 this happened in accordance with closure agreements approved earlier in the year by suriname s parliament while the transfer of the dam ends an important chapter in our history in the country we will remain to work on remediation of the sites for years to come in closing alcoa has made significant progress since we launched as an independent company in 2016 we ve resolved numerous legacy items and strengthened our balance sheet by managing our liabilities and eliminating high cost unprofitable capacity from our portfolio there is still much work to do and our strategic priorities will continue to guide us as will our values we are focused on being low cost which means that we will consistently work to reduce complexity so we can better compete in a global cyclical commodity industry we will be margin focused with our new operating model we are streamlining our operations and we ll work to further improve our productivity across alcoa so we can drive returns across the value chain and finally we aim to advance sustainably capturing both financial and sustainability improvement that deliver value for alcoa s stockholders we have a clear roadmap for success and we are determined to progress no matter where we find ourselves in the commodity cycle and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question today will come from curt woodworth with credit suisse please go ahead curt woodworth credit suisse analyst yeah thanks good evening roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hi curt william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hey curt curt woodworth credit suisse analyst hey so first one for you bill could you just kind of walk through some of the cash restructuring items this year between point comfort the corporate restructuring as well as any kind of cash start up costs from becancour to try to get a little bit of feel for what is normalized and then you talked about transformation being 85 million this year how much of that would be non recurring as well or what s kind of in that number it s my first question william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so if you look at the page that has the sources and uses of cash and on that i think we talked about 200 million of cash outflow associated with kind of restructuring items the big numbers there are really two things one is the modern rolling mill divestiture in total that was 100 million in the second quarter the in addition to that the exit of the spanish smelters the combination of the curtailment the layoffs and then the subsequent divestiture to partner adds about 70 million and then the rest is various restructuring activities so about 200 million there we ve not disclosed how much i guess we have i m sorry in the second half of this year i m sorry in 2019 we expended 25 million on an after tax basis in becancour for the restart so that s included in those numbers also so those are the big items when you then go to transformation transformation as you know is approximately 22 sites around the world where we manage the closure and curtailment of those sites the big swing between 2019 and 2020 is that in 2019 we had the afobaka dams that was producing revenues for our suriname facility we have subsequently handed that dam back to the government of suriname and so we won t have that so approximately 50 million of that difference between 7 million and 85 million is the impact from the afobaka dam in addition to that we are now starting to spend money on point comfort and so as we take point comfort into closure we will spend money and so that s the biggest driver in addition to the afobaka dam that bridges that difference in 19 and 20 so we have given you enough color there to help you out curt woodworth credit suisse analyst yes that helps that helps a lot and then i guess second question just with respect to the market entering the year i think you had a forecast of 4 4 5 growth in china and came out to 1 which is a pretty meaningful downward revision and we re all well aware that they have plenty of the excess capacity maybe not totally clear with the cost curve for that looks like but when you kind of look at what happened in china this year you had pretty dramatic inventory reduction semis exports despite the worsening overcapacity situation arguably was flat and semis exports is actually down 14 in the fourth quarter and up until a couple days ago the shift prices that 16 month high so now you re kind of looking at this year forecasting a pretty sharp reacceleration in global demand yet the supply seems to overwhelm that and i guess do you think it seems like you still are very concerned on the china semis piece but maybe if you could kind of walk through how you think it could affect price and sort of the china piece would be helpful because it seems like what you would have thought would have transpired in 19 certainly did not in terms of the pressure on the external market william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes curt so let me try and hit a couple of pieces in that and make sure and we can make sure i m answering your question so i mean from the perspective of semis where when i look at that one of the concerns that i have is that essentially as you see the as you see these semis grow coming from china and i recognize that there is some differences that happened quarter on quarter but it essentially is pulling demand from rest of the world back into china and so the more that they tune up their business in semi fabricated products in coming both from scrap and from primary it tends to pull that demand growth or just pull basic demand from the rest of the world and where i am mostly concerned comes to the fact that the way that they ve built their industrial policies is not to incentivize the selling of primary metal but rather is to incentivize the production and then export of these semi fabricated products just to the value added taxes and the rebates offered for those products it s just essentially it s meant to capture those first basic set of products coming out of china and so it comes down to the supply and demand across all of aluminum and whether that is coming from both scrap or coming from primary aluminum and then how that interacts with the actual consumption of aluminum inside of china or outside of china in the end i think it s a global market and i think there are distortions between pricing inside of china and outside of china but the distortions are economically motivated and are connected back with these policies and so when we look at the two china s the two markets they tend to operate with their own set of supply and demand fundamentals but it is those semi fabricated products and in the worst of cases fake semis which we have seen continue in smaller portions but still there it is what reconnects those markets back and brings essentially both the marginal capacity in china and connected to the price setting that happens around the world and we see that in aluminum into a certain extent we also see china serving that role of marginal producer in alumina as well so i mean from a broader market perspective the most important thing is that we see that demand ramp back up again and as we look at this and as we look at the balance of risk both in trade policy and trade tensions which obviously ratcheted down a little bit today certainly not back to where they were a couple of years ago i think and as we look at the actual data coming out whether it s in construction of housing inside of china or automotive in europe i think we feel fairly confident with where we have projected our aluminum demand growth over this coming year but as you highlighted and circling back to the very beginning of your question curt that can change depending on how those metrics evolve i would like to think that there are risks to the upside but i also recognize the fact that this is the best estimate we have right now curt woodworth credit suisse analyst i mean in terms of the sort of the trade deal negotiations has there been any communication with the government regarding the massive export rebate that they get on semis or any dialog around trying to make amends for what are pretty clear substantial subsidies and semis roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so we spend a good portion of our time trying to make sure that we educate all the jurisdictions where we happen to produce in the us obviously as a very important set of discussions to make sure they understand how those subsidies in fact impact the market i think one of the best things that we ve had is that the publishing of that oecd report which has helped to put into numbers from an independent third party or as independent as it can be i think that has helped to explain quantify and demonstrate that how that subsidization works and how it then connects over into the not just into primary aluminum but into the down into those semi fabricated markets as well so i think we ve done a good job explaining it but now we need to see real action that starts to correct it and again this announcement just yesterday with the agreement between japan the us and the eu is a great first step it pushes us in the right direction but it is a first step and doesn t necessarily have the actions yet delineated about what will make the difference so it s a good beginning but just the beginning curt woodworth credit suisse analyst great i appreciate your comments thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks curt operator our next question will come from carlos de alba with morgan stanley please go ahead carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah thank you very much for taking the question so first one is related to the usmca so and given the concern that you express on the imports or the exports of semis from china i m not aware maybe it did happen but i m not aware that in the new text it is required even over time that receive the benefits of the new agreement you need to pour and melt the aluminum in the region as they did for the steel was there any reason why that may not have been included in the final tax roy and would it still be possible to maybe add something similar to what they have done in steel which it s going to take seven years after the signature of the signing of the agreement is when it kicks in but it definitely will protect some of the producers in the three countries and then my second question if i may is just on you mentioned that the better demand growth outlook in 2020 versus last year you alluded to europe transport and construction and transport in china but nothing in the us i wonder if you could give us some comments as to how you see the different end markets here in north america roy c harvey president and chief executive officer sure so let me hit the usmca first and i ll probably steer clear of trying to look into the minds of the negotiators to figure out exactly how they came to their conclusions i think there are incremental improvements i think the when you think about the expectations for growing that produced and manufactured in north america i think it is positive on whole for the usmca but it does as you mentioned fall short of where it could have been why that is the case and the relative lobbying interests of how that law gets put into action i think is beyond my ability to explain clearly i think it is i think on the whole it is positive of course we would have liked to have been even more positive given our footprint in canada and the us particularly on your second question about the demand growth outlook and particularly in the us you hit my main points i think we re seeing some green shoots in europe particularly in transportation i think china will come back in the us i think we ve not yet seen that we ve turned the corner as far as starting to see growth again in our end markets i think there are the catalysts to perhaps start to see that improve but from my perspective and as we look across each of these different markets the fact is there s just not we re not yet at a point where we re actually seeing that manufacturing pickup and therefore starting to see that turn into actual aluminum orders i think as we alluded to also and bill talked about it it s from a value added market standpoint as well it s a difficult market out there with rusal back in the mix because remember there were sanctions at the beginning of last year which was during the normal season where we sign all those contracts and we ve also because of the elevated premiums both midwest and product premiums in the us started to see that some additional imports have been coming into the us even though they have to pay the duty so it s we ve not yet seen that demand turn and we still haven t and we re seeing headwinds when it comes to our value added premiums in the us as well again i think there are catalysts for positive change i think the recent developments that we ve seen with china in particularly if we start to advance toward a phase ii part of the deal i think that gives us the catalyst for improvements happening more quickly however right now this is the best estimate we ve got carlos carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst excellent thank you very much roy all the best to you guys in 2020 roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks carlos operator our next question will come from matthew korn with goldman sachs please go ahead matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey good evening everybody william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hey matt roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey matt matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey a question for you bill next year the 70 80 tax rate a little higher than we had thought i know the elevated levels last couple of quarters had included some catch up true up expense currently speaking is the expectation for the next year is that all jurisdictional mix are there other pieces at play that we should know about william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer no it s all jurisdictional mix right i mean it comes what it comes down to is we make money in australia and we ve got a tax rate in australia that it gets applied to the pbt we lose money in certain jurisdictions around the world where we are reserve for taxes so we essentially have no tax benefit and that s how you end up getting to that high rate matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it and second you know i am interested you ve moved more toward the sustainability you might that is part of the framework you got the emphasis here on the carbon free aluminum what can you tell us because technically is fitting for this call how the elysis is actually produced i ve been on the website it wasn t able to extract a whole lot of information and i know it s early in the process but it s also commercially major first delivery so anything you can say and how the economics of this compares is a premium on price expected does that make up for what i d assume additional cost what can you tell us more about that as a commercial enterprise roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yes matt i thought you were asking about the technical aspects and i was going to launch into a 45 minute discussion i hope of how we do that and then as every secrecy at the end of that it sounds like you re looking more for parts of how the economics we expect the economics to work we ve been working on this for a while matt and the idea was always find a process that is more economical and has a better invested capital cost versus what we saw as traditional traditional smelting technology in the meantime of course china has come roaring in with good technology at the same time with pretty reduced capital costs so the world has changed quite a bit we still believe that when we think about the cost of installing capacity in the operating cost of then operating it and focused on projects outside of china we have this process is going to be more economically efficient and because you re no longer changing anodes and such a short cycle you end up having pretty significant savings in the operating side as well i would also argue and where i think that this can become an even more powerful opportunity for the future is by nurturing and growing that what is today a niche market for premiums for sustainable metal in particularly for what will be the lowest carbon metal on the planet when you connect one of the when you connect this elysis process to hydropower into alumina and bauxite that is mined and then refined in low carbon intensity ways when you bring this all together it will be the lowest carbon metal on the planet i think that is we re comfortable with making that statement and so you have to then determine what does that premium going to look like i think it says a lot that apple was the apple chose to invest with us and i think it also means a lot that they wanted that first commercial production of metal because there will be a demand what we need to do as an aluminum company and i know some of our competitors are working on this as well is nurture and develop that market so that premium will exist or on the other side if discount exist for carbon intense products that might be produced outside of in other people systems so that i d love to tell you that we have quantified what that number will be but that s really that looming question that we need to decide not only for elysis but for our portfolio because just transitioning back to the changes that we re making in alcoa in the existing portfolio that we have we have the benefit that we re making these changes because they re the right thing to do financially future proofing and cycle proofing our portfolio in smelting is the right thing to do we need to be in the first quartile because it s a rough and tumble business but also having the added benefit of then being the lowest carbon emitter of all the smelting systems in the world then positions us to capture that premium for elysis yes but even more importantly for the broader portfolio which the lot of tons as we emerge from there so to me it s the reason we talk more about this because i think it is a trend that is growing in importance i believe that at some point that premium or that discount will become more real but would not hazard to guess as to what that number is going to be at this point matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it last quarter you did emphasize how much you saw sustainability is something tied in environment and also economics so we ll be watching carefully as this market develops thanks very much and good luck roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks matt william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks matt operator our next question will come from chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead christopher terry deutsche bank analyst hi roy and bill thanks for taking my question hi yeah the first question i had just thinking the big picture slide 23 where you go through it s not new i don t think but the target to get to 2 billion to 2 5 billion net debt including the pension just wanted to if you could given where you are at today if you could just step through a few of the pieces there so maybe as a start if you could split out maybe the target on net debt as opposed to the target on the overall pension and then if i just do the math on that you re trying to reduce that i guess 0 8 billion to 1 3 billion you should get another 200 million from the gum springs transaction and then if you do reach the upper end of your 1 billion 500 million to 1 billion asset sales target you take of most of that so there s not a lot of loud pouring actual cash flow am i reading that correctly i just wanted you to step through the latest and how you re seeing that goal that two to four year goal william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so one thing i would just start out by saying chris is if you look at page 40 that s the reconciliation of the net debt calculation so if we start there that would say that we re sitting at the end of 2019 at a 3 4 billion net debt calculation so to get to that level that we re targeting we would need to come off of that 3 4 billion essentially what we have said and first of all that was originally a three to five year target we are now making that a two to four year target because one year has passed we can get to that level of net debt by simply making our required minimum pension contributions there is a bunch of assumptions built into that and i ll tell you what those assumptions are we hit our expected return on assets 6 5 for the us varies across other parts of the world but the big number is 6 5 in the us and discount rates don t change substantially from where they are today so simply by making our minimum contributions we can do that that should then lead you to the question ok you started going down the path of 200 million of at least in the near term 200 million for gum springs an extra 50 million once we meet those post closing requirements and the additional asset sales and remember i would tell you that gum springs maybe we didn t say this but gum springs was included in our asset sale list so we ve executed now on nearly half of the bottom end layer of or level of that asset sale list so then we will use that cash and redeploy it in the capital allocation model that s on page 23 all right so that capital allocation model is pretty clear we won t have 1 billion of cash on the balance sheet we want to invest in the business in sustaining capital this year that will be 400 million we want to do small return seeking projects of 75 million this year and beyond that any excess free cash flow will be used for the four items down at the bottom essentially the debt reduction repositioning the portfolio the large say the mid size growth projects that we have and then returning cash to shareholders so that s the way you should be thinking about it and i just to circle back to your original point we think we can get to our net debt target simply by making our minimum pension contributions over the next few years christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks that s helpful i just had a couple of follow up on the cost side if we think about you ve gone through some of this already but just thinking about over the course of 2020 and then into the future as you want to move down toward the first quartile in the aluminum business just wanted if you could step through some of the opportunity particularly on the cost side and that s across all your business so maybe if you could discuss caustic carbon energy etc just directionally over the next say 12 months to 18 months thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i ll hit the raw materials piece first and then we can talk more broadly about some of the other things that will help us drive toward that first quartile you know that back in 2018 we saw significant cost headwinds in raw materials and 2018 s agent history at this point but we did see large increases 2019 was a year where we captured some of that back in raw materials 2020 i would tell you that that is accelerating the amount of reduction of raw materials in 2020 is larger than what we saw in 2019 i would project that we should see approximately 175 million of reduction in raw materials in 2020 that s coming from two areas that s first in caustic prices and then the second is in lower carbon prices so we are seeing some of that come back that we have seen higher costs over the last few years as far as addressing the repositioning our portfolio down to the first quartile that s going to be a combination of two things first is the asset review that we have we ve said that we have 1 5 metric tons of smelting capacity that will be either improved significantly sold or curtailed and then in addition to that and roy can speak more about this we re looking to really energize the productivity side of our business and to start to drive incremental cost savings not only in the smelters but on the refineries also roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and chris just to add a little bit on bill s last point and i won t belabor it but i think as we look toward this year s market and last year s market i think we ve regained a lot of stability across the portfolio but part of what we re trying to do with this operating model change is to make sure that we are being very clear in binary with each and every one of our plant managers about what success looks like for all of our plants and so that i believe will help us to drive a mentality about how to drive costs out of our plants as quickly as we possibly can and that is raw materials first and there is also a component of your usages of those raw materials and how smartly you can do that and when compared with the price of what you re using but it also connects over to maintenance costs to how you drive your plant to the choice about how you run electricity through your part so that you are giving the best financial outcomes so i think it s we re determined to see real improvements there i actually have a lot of confidence in our new operating team and we have some fresh people that are looking at problems that we ve been working on for the last decade and we are determined to make sure that that ends up being improvements in productivity and improvements in the end of our cost efficiencies so more to come in that certainly chris but it s it is really one of the most important things we ll be doing in 2020 and beyond christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks guys just one more if i may the capex guidance or sustaining capex of 400 million versus 290 million for 2019 is that 400 million is that the go forward rate we should expect in beyond 2020 as well or is there other items in that thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so just to put some characterization around the 400 million spent 290 million in 2019 the big difference between 2019 and 2020 are the two mine moves we ve got one in full swing down in australia in 2020 and we will just be starting one in brazil in 2020 both of those will be wrapped up in 2021 we haven t provided an outlook past 2020 but i think at least in the bauxite segment we will have elevated spending on the mine moves for the next couple of years and so that s what s driving it christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks that s it from me roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks chris william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question will come from david gagliano with bmo please go ahead david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions i just have a couple of fairly quick ones first on the 35 million quarter over quarter decline in ebitda in the bauxite business how much of that is due to the seasonal volume decline and how much of that is due to the price decline william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer the price decline is the biggest piece of that dave out of the 35 million i would tell you probably two thirds of that is coming from both inter company and external pricing and the inter company clearly is picked up on the refining side but so out of the 35 million two thirds is priced and a third is seasonal lower volumes david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay and then just a related question on that as we think about that moving forward just for segment modeling purposes i m assuming that that piece that s price decline driven is pretty much reasonable run rate moving forward at this point correct william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah for 2020 we typically reset internal bauxite pricing once a year unless there is a major move in the marketplace that changes which we haven t really seen over the last couple of years so yeah i think assume that for 2020 david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay great and then just my other question slightly bigger picture when i look at the volume targets for 2020 they imply year over year growth of about 5 to 8 obviously there is a fairly cautious backdrop in terms of calling for global surplus in primary aluminum i get the becancour restart but my question really is without identifying specific assets how much of that 3 0 million to 3 1 million tons of third party shipments should we consider to be under review for curtailment realistically as we move through 2020 if prices stay soft and premiums continue to fade william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s really really difficult to answer dave when we look at the portfolio clearly there are some plants that are fairly high costs and we ll be looking at those in 2020 in light of market dynamics and those decisions will be made fairly quickly i can only point you to the fact that 90 days in to our announced strategy we already have closed or at least announced the closure of point comfort and have already executed on nearly half of the bottom end of the range on the asset sales so i would tell you we look at each plant we look at the run rate economics and we look at the current market environment and we ll make decisions fairly expeditiously operator our next question will come from lucas pipes with b riley fbr please go ahead lucas pipes b riley fbr inc analyst hey good afternoon everybody i ve quick follow up question on the gum springs transaction is that akin to a sale leaseback and if so what sort of ebitda contribution was this plant or would this plant be generating under the current under the structure that you agreed to would appreciate any color on that thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it is not a sale leaseback it is an out and out sale and it s a sale to veolia and as far as ebitda contribution in 2019 the plant lost 12 million we had kind of use of improving the plant to be a breakeven in 2020 so that gives you a pretty good indication of the contribution of gum springs to our financials we do have a mid term contract for processing spent potlining so we know that they will be taking our spl for a number of years but from my perspective this is a really good deal it gets the plant it s a good deal for alcoa it s a good deal for our shareholders but it s also a good deal for the plant it gets the plant to be owned by a company that s going to grow the capabilities and our employees that are alcoans say that are going to have a bright future so i think it s a really good transaction lucas pipes b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful and it s not like you re guaranteeing a certain number of profitability to the plant william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer no absolutely not i mean we will be sending our spl there for a number of years but we are not guaranteeing a profitability level lucas pipes b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful appreciate it and best of luck william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator our next question will come from timna tanners with bank of america please go ahead timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah hey happy new year roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks timna william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey there so just to follow up on a few points i wanted to clarify if you could give us an update on tax for the portland complex and energy subsidies how to think about that complex going forward and then along the same lines how far along are we in terms of the benefit already being or still yet to come in terms of the becancour start up and the spanish smelter closure roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so let me start on portland essentially the deal that we agreed to was a 4 5 year deal and that will go out to the middle of 2021 and so in between now and that particular moment in time we need to see if there is a repowering solution or if there is another eventuality for that plant so in the midst of discussions with government it s a plant that operates very stably it is a very good it is a good technology it just happens to be one of the most highest energy price markets on the planet so you ll not see action on that in fact part of that agreement is that we wouldn t take action until the middle of 2021 on becancour your second question timna we re about halfway through the restart from a pot standpoint we actually have all employees will be back in the plant and back helping to tend those pots by the end of this month we re having a very good so far we re having a good start up i mean i ve been very pleased with it and it s an important situation where we ve been following this lockout for 18 months it is important for us to reestablish those connections with our employees but also it is an environment that takes a lot of care those becancour workers happen to be some of best that we have around our system so really positive to see how that is progressing so on the right track william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me throw some numbers around that on becancour timna when we announced becancour restart we said we would spend 30 million to 35 million after tax in the second half of 2019 and an additional 30 million to 35 million in the first half of 2020 we are actually the spending has probably been a little bit more back end loaded than what we anticipated so we spent about 25 million in the second half at becancour that gets pushed to the first half of 2020 so at this point we re not reducing our overall estimate of the spend put spain a little bit of perspective for you the fact that we have divested spain spain was about a 40 million ebitda hit in 2019 and that s before any of the special items that was just the operations so we won t have that ebitda hit in 2020 clearly since we don t own the asset we still have some payments that have to go out to our partner or the people who bought it who are known as partner and that s about 68 million that has to be done over the next six quarters so we still have that cash outflow over the next six quarters in that 68 million total timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay super helpful thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hope that helps timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah that s great thank you and then the only other question i wanted to ask is just taking a step back i know in the past you ve talked about thinking about cash returns to shareholders at above 1 billion in terms of cashing about it seems like you re getting close to that level but obviously also a lot of cash requirements into next year so i just wanted any updated thinking on is that you had 1 billion and you start to think about it or you want to position that for a couple of quarters or have those priorities changed or how you think about cash returns thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the priorities clearly haven t changed the capital allocation model is the same as the one that we announced last quarter if we get to the 1 billion level we ll balance between those four items and as you said there are some things that are going to cost us cash the repositioning of the portfolio will cost us some cash but we ll balance what i would tell you is i was personally pleased with the fact that we generated cash in the four quarter again we generated cash in the third quarter these are fairly tough market environment and we generated cash and at the same time we made the contributions toward all the things that we needed to contribute toward so for instance we made our mandatory required pension contributions in the fourth quarter so from an overall perspective i would tell you that one of the bright spots in the quarter was the cash balance at the end of the year timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay fair enough thanks again roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks timna operator our next question comes from john tumazos independent please go ahead john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you could you elaborate a little bit more on the chinese aluminum demand we read that vehicle sales fell 8 2 last year which are the markets were up in china and which are the markets are the one or two biggest markets for aluminum in china roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so that s a pretty broad question john so let me sort of couch it in terms of how we see that market growing into 2020 i don t know if i ll exactly hit where you were going with the question but hopefully at least it gives you the right direction william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer and as we ve done that we ll put some numbers down on it roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah so from when you look across the board the largest component sits inside of construction i think one of the highlights that people saw in the chinese market last year that you started to see building starts come back again unfortunately for last year aluminum really comes in at the end of the process so what we re hoping to see this year is that those building starts turn into building completions we have started to see that turn the corner as we come into 2020 and so that s going to help drive some growth in the construction market and happily that is the largest consumption of aluminum that happens inside of china from a transportation standpoint that one is also an important market we believe that the stimulus programs and what s happening in china is going to be driving that into a positive growth as well for this coming year i think it was a difficult 2019 i don t particularly have the negative 8 that you referenced but we should see that come back and in fact come back to be one of the strongest growth in the markets that we ll see across china i would just also mention that we continue to see some decent growth in packaging and foil in fact that growth will be down a little bit compared to the strong growth that we saw in 2019 that s a pretty big contributor to the overall aluminum consumption in china but i think we continue to see that aluminum as a packaging material continues to be strong and continues to grow william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer no you hit all the things largely that i wanted to cover roy i mean the big market john is construction and roy addressed that the next kind of bigger markets are packaging and foil machinery transportation we did see transportation in a contraction like you did probably not the same level that you re referencing but we see that turning around pretty well in 2020 so those are the big markets john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah thanks john operator our next question will come from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg bank analyst thanks for taking my question just to follow up on a couple of other questions on the end market how close are you to your end market customer now given that you don t have any downstream business do you know every shipment going out of your facility whether it s going to construction or automotive or is that more about you having some market intelligence and market sources that s how you have a read in the end market demand roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah i d say paretosh that when we get to the actual aluminum consumption that goes into the end markets that is because of who we are alcoa corp instead of alcoa inc we are a step removed from that final end market so we put our effort into trying to understand what s coming out from other analysts and from what we hear and what we see in our sales of value added products in aluminum value added rolled products in aluminum so i think it s more an interpretation and not so much driven by what our what s coming out of our smelters we do have a pretty good idea of where our metal is going particularly when it comes to value added products so typically it is very different whether it s going into the can sheet or whether it s going into billet or extrusions etc but it s particularly for p1020 for the commodity grade that can go into any kind of use paretosh misra berenberg bank analyst got it and just a quick follow up on the aluminum shape premiums has there been any change this year versus last year i guess that s mostly a contract business roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah and the fact is that there has been a change and unfortunately it s not for the better is in fact a decline what we re seeing really and remember that we are very skewed toward north america and europe but we re seeing pretty significant declines for two reasons number one we ve seen that midwest premium come down and number two we ve seen product shape and alloy premiums also come down that i would tie it over to two things number one rusal come back into the market so if you remember at the end of 2018 i mean beginning of 2019 with most of those contracts were set for the 2019 annual year particularly in north america rusal was still under sanction so they were not able to step into a lot of those value added businesses for 2020 obviously the sanctions are behind them and thus they are now fully participating and are really driving to recapture market share so that is certainly having an impact on the amount of material that s available and number two and also important is because you had a period of such differentiated higher midwest premiums i think it attracted a decent amount of imported material that we re really starting to see coming into the 2020 markets you ve seen that come in i think that could change as we ve seen the best premiums come off their highs but at the same time we re seeing an more imports both from rusal and from others in the 2020 value added premium markets operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference to roy harvey for any closing remarks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer good thank you sean and i would like to thank everybody for your time and attention today we will continue to act aggressively to improve this company and to act on the strategic program that we ve set out and to make sure that we position ourselves for success into the future so thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you here three months down the road operator duration 76 minutes call participants james dwyer vice

whenever an economy is about to slip into recession a period of high inflation possible currency devaluation or massive political unrest high net worth individuals invest in gold why find out here gold is a precious metal that has been desired by humans from the earliest era of civilization logical enough that people started to invest in gold long ago and it s now one of not only the earliest but also one of the most popular investment opportunities globally similar to every other commodity with value sold in the market gold has fluctuating prices based on its supply and corresponding demand the major way gold is gotten is by extraction from hard rocks however there are other means of getting gold like the extensive processes involved in producing gold through placer mining or as a by product of copper mining the biggest use of gold is in the fashion industry it is used in the production of jewelry which is worn by the rich and wealthy in the society there are other industries that extensively make use of gold such as health aviation electronics etc the entities that purchase gold the most are fashion brands the government and the reserve banks of varying nations the country with the most gold in the world is the united states of america for decades after the great depression of 1929 the u s bought up several amounts of gold from other countries and even from their citizens this has largely contributed to its massive storage of gold germany is the second nation with the highest amount of gold and the financial body the international monetary fund imf comes third gold is part of the currencies in the imf s basket for special drawing rights sdr apart from international bodies and governments individuals can also buy gold as a commodity it is mostly viewed as a diversifying investment in portfolios why invest in gold whenever an economy is about to slip into a recession of any kind high net worth individuals invest in gold this is because while currencies depreciate in value with the aforementioned factors gold doesn t it is frequently said in the financial markets that history repeats itself many investors invest in gold because of its performance in the past years the price of gold has enormously increased in the last 4 decades especially from 1978 to 1980 and 1999 to 2011 there have however been periods of stagnation for gold s price as observed in the 1990s and the post 2011 era the major reason gold massively increased in price during 1980 and 1999 was because of inflation fears political uncertainty in the us after 9 11 and the iraqi war also helped contribute to the boost in gold s price recession and increased inflation were the motives behind the bullish move in gold s charts the bullish move was sustained because of numerous troubles in different economies all over the world these troubles included the high inflation of the us dollar and the bearish outlook of europe s economy however this great performance of gold s price isn t always consistent when the outlook of an economy is solid gold s price practically remains stagnant against that currency experiencing consolidating movements in price due to technical analyst traders in the 1990s gold s price didn t change much because of an increase in us gross domestic product the end of the bearish outlook on the us dollar following the global financial meltdown in 2011 drove gold from a sharp uptrend into a sustained downtrend and later a consolidating market the strength of the stock market also had a negative effect on gold s price as investors felt they d hedged enough in gold and were ready to make a fortune from the stock exchange three basic gold investment opportunities 1 gold bullion the gold bullion is the most popular type of possessing gold gold bullion can be described as gold that is totally or almost pure and has been attested for its mass and purity the gold coin or bar would then be affixed with a serial number for identification looking at heavy gold bars is a beautiful sight but they come with a slight ugliness to them they re highly illiquid and cannot easily be exchanged for cash this is due to the expense of purchasing and selling gold gold bars are also somewhat indivisible an important quality that is needed for liquid money if you want gold bars that are easy to be bought and sold you can go for intermediate or small sizes 2 gold funds investors who strictly do not want to have gold in their possession usually invest in gold exchange traded funds etfs and mutual funds this practically means they can take part in sharing gold profits without actually holding an investor can purchase the shares of an etf tracking gold a single share equates to a certain quantity of gold different brokers can help in the purchase of gold s etf shares since they re traded on the stock exchange just like stocks investing in gold etf is also beneficial to small investors in terms of risk reduction since the minimum buy in is a single share of the etf the average etf charges an expense ratio of 0 44 annually which covers their transaction costs some mutual funds possess gold in bulk in the quest to diversify their portfolio however a very small number of mutual funds invest only in gold funds like etfs only track the indexes of gold mining companies and thus charge lower expense ratios to mutual funds most gold investors however prefer to invest in gold etfs and gold mutual funds as an alternative to purchasing gold bars 3 gold futures and options a future can be described as an agreement to purchase or make a sale of a commodity at a certain date and time in the future gold futures are considered contracts and also represent a fixed amount of gold this method of investing in gold is similar to the margin trading of cryptocurrencies to purchase gold futures the investor has to open an account with a reputable broker and deposit the minimum amount required most times in usd or the local currency by the broker this is the minimum amount required to open a position on the exchange usually referred to as the initial margin in layman terms trading gold futures involves opening a position at a price and predicting the direction gold will move if the price of gold goes in the direction predicted by the trader then profit is made otherwise the trade results in a loss after a certain number of trades if the account balance of the investor falls below the maintenance margin the trader would be required to deposit some more money in order to get your account balance to be at par with the initial margin on the delivery option quite a number of brokers do not have this so when the contract expires it is then settled in cash the investors when trading gold futures should have this in mind and set the expiration of the contract in accordance with the time required for their trade to yield some profit the market is said to be in contango when the price of earlier expiry futures and spot prices are lower than the prices of later expiry contracts purchasing gold futures under this condition will require a payment on premium for later expiry contracts when reverse is the case the market is said to be in backwardation gold options on the other hand are an alternative to the outright purchase of futures contracts instead of the variability in price at any point when the investor chooses to buy a futures contract options afford the investor the opportunity to purchase the futures contract at a fixed price and during a particular period one advantage of options is that despite the fact that it leverages the initial deposit it limits the losses to the initial investment futures contract as mentioned earlier can incur losses that are greater than the initial investment provided the losses are huge and sequential investing in options however has its downside futures contracts allow the investor to purchase gold at its current value but the case is not the same for options the investors would be required to pay a premium based on gold s market value in order to purchase the contract at the preset price and period what affects gold prices gold is a commodity and obviously obeys the law of supply and demand since it is also traded in financial markets it is also subject to price actions and the behavior of investors gold is however not subject to inflation as proven by economists their studies show that unlike fiat currency which experiences inflation as more are printed into circulation the supply of gold is constant and its mining output doesn t do much to its price statistics from the great recession and further studies show that fear is what drives the price of gold most times as investors run to gold when an economic crisis hits since gold isn t consumed like oil or coffee how then does inflation not hit gold the answer is simple the jewelry or asset carved out from gold ends up in some drawer somewhere on a person or in some home pretty much all the gold that has ever been mined is still somewhere on the earth and the demand for the luxury that comes with gold items has never declined the central banks are also a driving factor behind the price of gold especially when the forex reserves are getting full the central bank then begins disposing of some of its gold since it is a dead asset and generates no return for the economy

aa earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 alcoa corporation aa q4 2019 earnings call 5 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good afternoon and welcome to the alcoa corporation fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings presentation and conference call please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to mr james dwyer vice president of investor relations please go ahead james dwyer vice president of investor relations thank you sean and good day everyone i m joined today by roy harvey alcoa corporation president and chief executive officer and william oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer we will take your questions after comments by roy and bill as a reminder today s discussion will contain forward looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today s presentation and in our sec filings in addition we have included some non gaap financial measures in this presentation reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures can be found in the appendix to today s presentation any reference in our discussion today to ebitda means adjusted ebitda also a note on our financial statements effective january 1 2019 the company changed its accounting method for valuing certain inventories from lifo to average cost the effects of the change in accounting principle have been retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented finally as previously announced the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website with that here is roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you jim and thanks to everyone for joining us today we ve got a lot to discuss so let s start with a quick overview of the fourth quarter results for the quarter we reported a net loss of 303 million or 1 63 per share this includes charges associated with the closure of our point comfort refinery in texas which had been fully curtailed since 2016 and it includes the cost of additional actions we ve taken to manage liabilities associated with pensions and other post employment benefits excluding special items we reported an adjusted net loss of 57 million or 0 31 per share on an adjusted ebitda basis excluding special items we generated 346 million lastly we closed the fourth quarter with 879 million in cash the second sequential quarterly increase in our cash balance now as we prepare to close out 2019 let s review some of the actions we ve taken and how our priorities are guiding us to make additional improvements last quarter we ve refreshed our company s three strategic priorities first we are focused on being a low cost producer which means reducing complexity to better compete through all parts of the cycle in our commodity markets second we intend to improve our margins and invest wisely to drive returns and finally we are working to advance sustainably which includes actions toward a strengthened balance sheet a cycle proof portfolio and an enhanced reputation for environmental and social excellence we ve made quick progress last quarter with these refreshed priorities and more will be done in the quarters ahead to reinforce alcoa s competitiveness we have moved with speed to further reduce overhead with a new leaner operating model we are working to generate additional cash from the sales of non core assets and we have started a comprehensive review of our current portfolio to improve long term profitability turning to our fourth quarter business update most importantly we had no serious injuries in the quarter we also continued our strong operational performance with new quarterly production records from our bauxite mine in juruti and our wagerup refinery in the fourth quarter we also completed a modernized labor agreement in australia covering more than half of our unionized employees there we also became members of the international council of mining and metals known as icmm which is dedicated to improving the sustainable development performance in the industry we are working with icmm to develop a global standard for the safe management of tailings dams and we re honored to be part of this very important effort also in december our joint venture elysis shipped to apple aluminum produced with a new carbon free smelting process alcoa invented this technology which eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions instead this breakthrough process produces pure oxygen as an early investor apple asked to purchase the first commercial batch of aluminum produced with this new process while elysis works to scale up this technology so it can be licensed in 2024 in a world becoming more and more focused on sustainability this technology has the potential to transform the conventional process used to produce aluminum now let s turn to the full year 2019 in addition to closing another fatality free year our 2019 accomplishments span across our business in throughout the year we drove improved stability in our operations and set annual production records for both our bauxite and alumina portfolios we ve reached several new modernized labor agreements with the australian workers union in november and with unions in the united states and canada earlier in the year taken together these contracts cover almost 70 of the unionized employees in these three countries importantly they incorporate provisions that will allow our plants to better compete the multi year agreements feature improved salaried union collaboration and efficient work practices in the us we ve reached a four year master agreement that covers approximately 1 600 active employees at five locations in canada we ve reached agreements with the two separate unions that represent 100 of our unionized employees in that country first at baie comeau we secured a six year agreement that covers about 600 employees next after an 18 month lockout we reached a six year agreement at the becancour smelter that was ratified on july 2 today the smelter s restart is progressing well under that new labor contract and is on schedule for completion in the second quarter all employees eligible for recall are now back to work also last year we completed the divestiture of the historically unprofitable aviles and la coruna smelters in spain after reaching an agreement with the workers representatives at these two facilities in november we also implemented our new operating model for a leaner company which will provide annual savings beginning in the second quarter of this year finally in our markets 2019 ended in a global deficit for aluminum and surpluses in bauxite and alumina we see slight surpluses ahead in 2020 for bauxite and alumina and a balanced market for aluminum we ll discuss more on the markets and these other topics after bill provides a detailed review of the results so with that i ll turn it over to bill william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy reviewing our income statement revenues were down 131 million or 5 sequentially due to lower realized prices for alumina and aluminum partially offset by improved volumes year over year revenues declined 908 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 again on lower alumina and aluminum prices in the quarter restructuring charges drove the net loss attributable to alcoa corporation of 303 million or 1 63 per share on a 185 6 million average shares for the quarter special items in the fourth quarter totaled 246 million after tax and non controlling interests the key components this quarter were the 274 million charge related to the closing of our point comfort texas alumina refinery 75 million related to pension and opeb changes and 23 million of becancour restart costs partially offset by non controlling interest and favorable interim tax impacts now let s look at the income statement excluding special items our fourth quarter adjusted net loss excluding special items was 57 million or 0 31 per share adjusted ebitda excluding special items was 346 million our fourth quarter ebitda margin was 14 2 the full year operational tax rate ended the year at 67 9 the higher annual rate required true up of prior periods in the fourth quarter adding 28 million to the expense or 0 15 per share and brought the operational rate for the quarter to 99 5 let s look closer at factors driving adjusted ebitda this quarter lower raw materials costs partially offset the impact of lower alumina and aluminum prices lower market prices for alumina and aluminum drove adjusted ebitda down 77 million and 23 million respectively taken together all other impacts improved 58 million sequentially partially offsetting the price impact raw material costs primarily for carbon at the smelters and cost to get the refineries continued their improvement but were partially offset by higher production costs at mines and smelters inter segment eliminations drove the change in other category as lower alumina prices changes in refinery cost structures and lower alumina inventories released profit held in inventory now let s move to the segments in the segments bauxite adjusted ebitda continued near its record high level at 42 ebitda margin alumina adjusted ebitda declined 90 million on lower sales prices aluminum adjusted ebitda improved 32 million sequentially on better alumina costs partially offset by lower aluminum prices and lower value added product premiums non segment impacts contributed 6 million 18 million better than last quarter inter segment eliminations were favorable 15 million and other corporate costs improved 3 million turning to cash in the fourth quarter we ended the year with cash of 879 million up 38 million sequentially year over year cash declined 234 million a quick review of our major cash sources and uses for 2019 our total cash sources were 2 billion consisting of 1 7 billion in adjusted ebitda and approximately 300 million sourced from changes in working capital the largest outflows of cash were tax payments including 351 million in payments of prior year income tax net distributions to our joint venture minority interest partner of 421 million 379 million of capital expenditures as well as 240 million of required pension and post employment benefits funding made an addition to the 52 million related expenses with an adjusted ebitda outflows also included 220 million in restructuring payments primarily the saudi rolling mill and spanish smelter divestitures now let s take a look at the balance sheet our balance sheet remains strong and reflects solid management in 2019 our fourth quarter days working capital was 27 days down three days sequentially and even with last year s fourth quarter we controlled total capital spending to 379 million a level 20 million lower than in 2018 our key balance sheet metric proportional adjusted net debt increased 135 million from last year primarily due to a lower cash ending balance at year end our consolidated pension and opeb net liability rounded up to 2 4 billion up only 40 million year over year in spite of lower discount rates increasing the net liability by approximately 600 million global pension asset returns were approximately 17 and actions taken to manage the pension and opeb liabilities offset the increase related to the discount rate now let s move to our outlook for 2020 first let s look at the income statement impacts we expect shipments to increase year over year in all three product segments as existing facilities creep production in bauxite and alumina and in aluminum our becancour restart ramps up with the divestiture of the afobaka hydroelectric dam in suriname and the gum springs arkansas treatment facility and the closure of the point comfort refinery we expect transformation ebitda to be negative by approximately 85 million compared to negative 7 million in 2019 the majority of that impact is from the divestiture of the suriname dam part of the positive impact of our new operating model and overhead cost reductions can be seen in lower other corporate impacts expected to improve by roughly 13 million the remainder of the impact we expect to see in the operating segments starting in the second quarter dd a expenses also has made it to improve and we expect interest expense and our operational tax rate to be similar to 2019 levels although market conditions can greatly impact the tax rate for cash flow impacts minimum required pension and opeb funding is planned to increase roughly 100 million as historical pension asset return shortfalls are funded sustaining capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately 400 million the key reasons for the increase are mine moves willowdale mine in australia will move major infrastructure several miles to a new reserve area an elaborate process that occurs there roughly every 25 years we are also starting a mine move at juruti in brazil expected to be complete in 2021 we will target return seeking capital at 75 million prior period tax payments are expected to be roughly 300 million or lower in 2020 as alumina prices were lower in 2019 and large prior year tax true ups are not expected we expect environmental and aro payments to increase to approximately 150 million reflecting the impact of the point comfort closure as usual in the appendix we also listed additional considerations expected for the first quarter they include bauxite adjusted ebitda to be down approximately 35 million on lower sales prices and seasonal maintenance outages in alumina we expect a 5 million sequential benefit from the point comfort closure while improvements from lower bauxite energy and raw material costs will offset the unfavorable mix of sales contracts and impacts of scheduled maintenance overhauls in the aluminum segment approximately 10 million benefit from lower alumina costs compared to the fourth quarter benefits from the becancour restart and lower raw material costs are expected to be more than offset by higher energy costs in europe lower shipments of rolled products and price and mix impacts in north america yielding an expected 5 million to 10 million sequential negative impact also in the second half of the year we expect to see the impact of the higher cost natural gas contracts for our western australia refineries that we announced in 2015 and 2018 these contracts cover 90 of western australia requirements and begin in the second half of 2020 in 2015 and 2016 we made 500 million in cash pre payments related to the 2015 contracts and net of those prepayments we expect 2020 cash payments for wa gas will increase our total australian refining cash costs 2 5 or 50 million compared to 2019 so with that i ll turn it back to you roy roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks bill as we start the new year i d like to recap our final view of the 2019 markets and provide new estimates for 2020 in bauxite the market ended the year with a smaller surplus than we estimated in the prior quarter decreased supply from guinea largely due to rainy season supply chain disruptions in the second half of the year is the primary reason for the lower surplus for 2020 we expect the market to be in a similarly sized surplus with increased supply from guinea and australia serving demand in china where we project bauxite imports will increase by close to 20 million tons year on year chinese refiners continue to build strategic stockpiles to mitigate their supply chain risks in alumina the year also finished with a smaller market surplus than we estimated previously this revision is due primarily to some delays in chinese refinery restarts and expansion in 2020 we expect a roughly balanced market globally increased demand from chinese smelters is expected to outpace alumina supply increases as such we expect china to remain a net importer of alumina in 2020 bringing in tons from the rest of the world surplus to meet its deficit finally in the aluminum market we maintain our estimate of a full year deficit for 2019 in 2020 we expect the global market will turn to surplus driven by additional supply from smelter expansions and restarts more than offsetting modest global demand growth we expect that china will continue to be a market a surplus market and in the world ex china we expect a balanced to slightly surplus market last year we lowered our expectation for 2019 world ex china global aluminum demand growth primarily due to trade tensions lower trade volumes and declining growth in manufacturing activity most notably in europe and north america for 2020 however we are anticipating a rebound in demand growth in both world ex china and in china we expect to see a recovery in key aluminum end use sectors including such important markets as the european transport sector and the construction and transportation sectors in china in summary while 2019 s economic conditions posed real challenges to the aluminum market we are cautiously optimistic about 2020 from a return to demand growth now let s transition from the current state of our global markets to medium to long term market trends and connect these developments to the strategic programs we announced in october in bauxite china s appetite for imports is likely to continue unabated with its imports projected to double between 2018 and 2025 due to the continued depletion of its own domestic supply china is also strategically stockpiling bauxite due to concerns about supply chain risks meanwhile alcoa has ownership in seven bauxite mines globally with a first quartile cost position these assets are strategically located to supply our own top tier alumina refining system and serve the third party market as bill mentioned we are increasing capex this year to fund additional mine moves which sustained our cost position and provides continued access to our long lived bauxite reserves we can provide high quality bauxite for both our own internal refining system and to global customers which we see as a competitive advantage in alumina chinese refineries will continue to face higher costs for bauxite relative to world ex china refineries due to the higher costs associated with importing seaborne bauxite this two illustrates the advantage of the low cost position of our refining system which is fully served by our own bauxite mines and have a low cost and highly dependable supply chain looking forward the complexity in china s bauxite supply will support steepness in the global cost curve alumina is notoriously difficult and costly to inventory which tends to keep supply and demand closely linked to a market efficient and transparent pricing mechanism and the management of bauxite residue is complex and alcoa has developed and deployed market leading and cost efficient best practices and that gives alcoa another competitive advantage in this attractive market for our company finally in aluminum chinese overcapacity continues to challenge the global market in the form of increased exports of semi fabricated products or semis chinese net semis exports are projected to increase from just under 3 million tons in 2018 to over 4 million tons in 2025 the excess supply of chinese semis will be exported to the world ex china effectively displacing primary aluminum in those markets this trend of growing chinese exports competing with aluminum produced outside of china is nothing new in fact over the past five years chinese exports of aluminum semis and finished products have captured more of the ex china total aluminum consumption growth than ex china smelters did this growth has been fueled by china s unfair subsidies which were detailed in last year s report by the organization for economic cooperation and development or the oecd the report clearly demonstrates that non market forces including financial subsidies and the value added tax rebates have contributed to increases in aluminum smelting capacities and incentivized chinese exports of semis with negative impacts across the value chain as a company we support free trade but it needs to be fair that s why we are encouraged by yesterday s agreement by the trade ministers for united states the european union in japan to strengthen existing world trade organization rules on industrial subsidies which would include aluminum this is a positive sign in our continued call for governments to address unfairly subsidized overcapacity in china and to ensure a level playing field while the rise of chinese exports resulting from subsidies has become the single most important issue facing the aluminum industry we are not waiting for government action or policy changes to transform our business we are evaluating our portfolio to ensure that our locations are sustainable financially and environmentally as i said earlier today our strategic priorities will guide us to improved competitiveness with low cost operations at the end of our portfolio review we expect not only to have an improved cost position but also to lead in a world becoming even more focused on sustainably produced products in aluminum we currently hold a high second quartile position on the cost curve and once we complete the capacity review we expect to enter the first quartile from an environmental perspective we expect that our smelting portfolio s carbon dioxide intensity will improve almost 50 due to the changes that we make as part of the portfolio review today we re already one of the lowest per ton emitters of carbon dioxide among global producers and approximately 70 of our metal is produced with renewable energy and once we progressed through our portfolio review we expect to be the lowest carbon emitter with 85 of our metal produced with renewable energy we believe that this environmental footprint strengthened by our continued portfolio actions will provide a true advantage in a world focused on sustainability now let s spend a bit more time discussing our most recent actions to improve first at the top left of the chart our new operating model took effect in the fourth quarter beginning in november it is expected to result in annual savings of 60 million in operating costs beginning in the second quarter we have eliminated our prior business unit structure and consolidated our sales procurement and other commercial capabilities importantly we are bringing our operations closer to our management team enabling faster decisions also we are making quick progress in our plan to generate between 500 million and 1 billion in cash through the sale of non core assets over the next 12 months to 18 months a few weeks ago we announced an agreement to sell our gum springs waste processing facility while the team there expanded the scope of services this facility can provide it is not a core function at alcoa so we have agreed to sell the location to a global environmental firm in a transaction valued at 250 million we will receive 200 million when the transaction closes this quarter and another 50 million upon the satisfaction of post closing conditions the additional cash we generate from the sale of non core assets will assist us in our work to reshape our existing portfolio as part of that multi year portfolio review we made the decision last month to permanently close the point comfort alumina refinery in texas which has been fully curtailed since 2016 this is the first action in a five year review process which is focused on 4 million metric tons of global refining capacity or 27 of our current portfolio and 1 5 million metric tons of smelting or approximately 50 of that segment s capacity finally we marked an important milestone in suriname where we successfully completed the transfer of the afobaka hydroelectric dam to the government effective december 31 2019 this happened in accordance with closure agreements approved earlier in the year by suriname s parliament while the transfer of the dam ends an important chapter in our history in the country we will remain to work on remediation of the sites for years to come in closing alcoa has made significant progress since we launched as an independent company in 2016 we ve resolved numerous legacy items and strengthened our balance sheet by managing our liabilities and eliminating high cost unprofitable capacity from our portfolio there is still much work to do and our strategic priorities will continue to guide us as will our values we are focused on being low cost which means that we will consistently work to reduce complexity so we can better compete in a global cyclical commodity industry we will be margin focused with our new operating model we are streamlining our operations and we ll work to further improve our productivity across alcoa so we can drive returns across the value chain and finally we aim to advance sustainably capturing both financial and sustainability improvement that deliver value for alcoa s stockholders we have a clear roadmap for success and we are determined to progress no matter where we find ourselves in the commodity cycle and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question today will come from curt woodworth with credit suisse please go ahead curt woodworth credit suisse analyst yeah thanks good evening roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hi curt william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hey curt curt woodworth credit suisse analyst hey so first one for you bill could you just kind of walk through some of the cash restructuring items this year between point comfort the corporate restructuring as well as any kind of cash start up costs from becancour to try to get a little bit of feel for what is normalized and then you talked about transformation being 85 million this year how much of that would be non recurring as well or what s kind of in that number it s my first question william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so if you look at the page that has the sources and uses of cash and on that i think we talked about 200 million of cash outflow associated with kind of restructuring items the big numbers there are really two things one is the modern rolling mill divestiture in total that was 100 million in the second quarter the in addition to that the exit of the spanish smelters the combination of the curtailment the layoffs and then the subsequent divestiture to partner adds about 70 million and then the rest is various restructuring activities so about 200 million there we ve not disclosed how much i guess we have i m sorry in the second half of this year i m sorry in 2019 we expended 25 million on an after tax basis in becancour for the restart so that s included in those numbers also so those are the big items when you then go to transformation transformation as you know is approximately 22 sites around the world where we manage the closure and curtailment of those sites the big swing between 2019 and 2020 is that in 2019 we had the afobaka dams that was producing revenues for our suriname facility we have subsequently handed that dam back to the government of suriname and so we won t have that so approximately 50 million of that difference between 7 million and 85 million is the impact from the afobaka dam in addition to that we are now starting to spend money on point comfort and so as we take point comfort into closure we will spend money and so that s the biggest driver in addition to the afobaka dam that bridges that difference in 19 and 20 so we have given you enough color there to help you out curt woodworth credit suisse analyst yes that helps that helps a lot and then i guess second question just with respect to the market entering the year i think you had a forecast of 4 4 5 growth in china and came out to 1 which is a pretty meaningful downward revision and we re all well aware that they have plenty of the excess capacity maybe not totally clear with the cost curve for that looks like but when you kind of look at what happened in china this year you had pretty dramatic inventory reduction semis exports despite the worsening overcapacity situation arguably was flat and semis exports is actually down 14 in the fourth quarter and up until a couple days ago the shift prices that 16 month high so now you re kind of looking at this year forecasting a pretty sharp reacceleration in global demand yet the supply seems to overwhelm that and i guess do you think it seems like you still are very concerned on the china semis piece but maybe if you could kind of walk through how you think it could affect price and sort of the china piece would be helpful because it seems like what you would have thought would have transpired in 19 certainly did not in terms of the pressure on the external market william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes curt so let me try and hit a couple of pieces in that and make sure and we can make sure i m answering your question so i mean from the perspective of semis where when i look at that one of the concerns that i have is that essentially as you see the as you see these semis grow coming from china and i recognize that there is some differences that happened quarter on quarter but it essentially is pulling demand from rest of the world back into china and so the more that they tune up their business in semi fabricated products in coming both from scrap and from primary it tends to pull that demand growth or just pull basic demand from the rest of the world and where i am mostly concerned comes to the fact that the way that they ve built their industrial policies is not to incentivize the selling of primary metal but rather is to incentivize the production and then export of these semi fabricated products just to the value added taxes and the rebates offered for those products it s just essentially it s meant to capture those first basic set of products coming out of china and so it comes down to the supply and demand across all of aluminum and whether that is coming from both scrap or coming from primary aluminum and then how that interacts with the actual consumption of aluminum inside of china or outside of china in the end i think it s a global market and i think there are distortions between pricing inside of china and outside of china but the distortions are economically motivated and are connected back with these policies and so when we look at the two china s the two markets they tend to operate with their own set of supply and demand fundamentals but it is those semi fabricated products and in the worst of cases fake semis which we have seen continue in smaller portions but still there it is what reconnects those markets back and brings essentially both the marginal capacity in china and connected to the price setting that happens around the world and we see that in aluminum into a certain extent we also see china serving that role of marginal producer in alumina as well so i mean from a broader market perspective the most important thing is that we see that demand ramp back up again and as we look at this and as we look at the balance of risk both in trade policy and trade tensions which obviously ratcheted down a little bit today certainly not back to where they were a couple of years ago i think and as we look at the actual data coming out whether it s in construction of housing inside of china or automotive in europe i think we feel fairly confident with where we have projected our aluminum demand growth over this coming year but as you highlighted and circling back to the very beginning of your question curt that can change depending on how those metrics evolve i would like to think that there are risks to the upside but i also recognize the fact that this is the best estimate we have right now curt woodworth credit suisse analyst i mean in terms of the sort of the trade deal negotiations has there been any communication with the government regarding the massive export rebate that they get on semis or any dialog around trying to make amends for what are pretty clear substantial subsidies and semis roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so we spend a good portion of our time trying to make sure that we educate all the jurisdictions where we happen to produce in the us obviously as a very important set of discussions to make sure they understand how those subsidies in fact impact the market i think one of the best things that we ve had is that the publishing of that oecd report which has helped to put into numbers from an independent third party or as independent as it can be i think that has helped to explain quantify and demonstrate that how that subsidization works and how it then connects over into the not just into primary aluminum but into the down into those semi fabricated markets as well so i think we ve done a good job explaining it but now we need to see real action that starts to correct it and again this announcement just yesterday with the agreement between japan the us and the eu is a great first step it pushes us in the right direction but it is a first step and doesn t necessarily have the actions yet delineated about what will make the difference so it s a good beginning but just the beginning curt woodworth credit suisse analyst great i appreciate your comments thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks curt operator our next question will come from carlos de alba with morgan stanley please go ahead carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst yeah thank you very much for taking the question so first one is related to the usmca so and given the concern that you express on the imports or the exports of semis from china i m not aware maybe it did happen but i m not aware that in the new text it is required even over time that receive the benefits of the new agreement you need to pour and melt the aluminum in the region as they did for the steel was there any reason why that may not have been included in the final tax roy and would it still be possible to maybe add something similar to what they have done in steel which it s going to take seven years after the signature of the signing of the agreement is when it kicks in but it definitely will protect some of the producers in the three countries and then my second question if i may is just on you mentioned that the better demand growth outlook in 2020 versus last year you alluded to europe transport and construction and transport in china but nothing in the us i wonder if you could give us some comments as to how you see the different end markets here in north america roy c harvey president and chief executive officer sure so let me hit the usmca first and i ll probably steer clear of trying to look into the minds of the negotiators to figure out exactly how they came to their conclusions i think there are incremental improvements i think the when you think about the expectations for growing that produced and manufactured in north america i think it is positive on whole for the usmca but it does as you mentioned fall short of where it could have been why that is the case and the relative lobbying interests of how that law gets put into action i think is beyond my ability to explain clearly i think it is i think on the whole it is positive of course we would have liked to have been even more positive given our footprint in canada and the us particularly on your second question about the demand growth outlook and particularly in the us you hit my main points i think we re seeing some green shoots in europe particularly in transportation i think china will come back in the us i think we ve not yet seen that we ve turned the corner as far as starting to see growth again in our end markets i think there are the catalysts to perhaps start to see that improve but from my perspective and as we look across each of these different markets the fact is there s just not we re not yet at a point where we re actually seeing that manufacturing pickup and therefore starting to see that turn into actual aluminum orders i think as we alluded to also and bill talked about it it s from a value added market standpoint as well it s a difficult market out there with rusal back in the mix because remember there were sanctions at the beginning of last year which was during the normal season where we sign all those contracts and we ve also because of the elevated premiums both midwest and product premiums in the us started to see that some additional imports have been coming into the us even though they have to pay the duty so it s we ve not yet seen that demand turn and we still haven t and we re seeing headwinds when it comes to our value added premiums in the us as well again i think there are catalysts for positive change i think the recent developments that we ve seen with china in particularly if we start to advance toward a phase ii part of the deal i think that gives us the catalyst for improvements happening more quickly however right now this is the best estimate we ve got carlos carlos de alba morgan stanley analyst excellent thank you very much roy all the best to you guys in 2020 roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks carlos operator our next question will come from matthew korn with goldman sachs please go ahead matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey good evening everybody william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hey matt roy c harvey president and chief executive officer hey matt matthew korn goldman sachs analyst hey a question for you bill next year the 70 80 tax rate a little higher than we had thought i know the elevated levels last couple of quarters had included some catch up true up expense currently speaking is the expectation for the next year is that all jurisdictional mix are there other pieces at play that we should know about william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer no it s all jurisdictional mix right i mean it comes what it comes down to is we make money in australia and we ve got a tax rate in australia that it gets applied to the pbt we lose money in certain jurisdictions around the world where we are reserve for taxes so we essentially have no tax benefit and that s how you end up getting to that high rate matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it and second you know i am interested you ve moved more toward the sustainability you might that is part of the framework you got the emphasis here on the carbon free aluminum what can you tell us because technically is fitting for this call how the elysis is actually produced i ve been on the website it wasn t able to extract a whole lot of information and i know it s early in the process but it s also commercially major first delivery so anything you can say and how the economics of this compares is a premium on price expected does that make up for what i d assume additional cost what can you tell us more about that as a commercial enterprise roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yes matt i thought you were asking about the technical aspects and i was going to launch into a 45 minute discussion i hope of how we do that and then as every secrecy at the end of that it sounds like you re looking more for parts of how the economics we expect the economics to work we ve been working on this for a while matt and the idea was always find a process that is more economical and has a better invested capital cost versus what we saw as traditional traditional smelting technology in the meantime of course china has come roaring in with good technology at the same time with pretty reduced capital costs so the world has changed quite a bit we still believe that when we think about the cost of installing capacity in the operating cost of then operating it and focused on projects outside of china we have this process is going to be more economically efficient and because you re no longer changing anodes and such a short cycle you end up having pretty significant savings in the operating side as well i would also argue and where i think that this can become an even more powerful opportunity for the future is by nurturing and growing that what is today a niche market for premiums for sustainable metal in particularly for what will be the lowest carbon metal on the planet when you connect one of the when you connect this elysis process to hydropower into alumina and bauxite that is mined and then refined in low carbon intensity ways when you bring this all together it will be the lowest carbon metal on the planet i think that is we re comfortable with making that statement and so you have to then determine what does that premium going to look like i think it says a lot that apple was the apple chose to invest with us and i think it also means a lot that they wanted that first commercial production of metal because there will be a demand what we need to do as an aluminum company and i know some of our competitors are working on this as well is nurture and develop that market so that premium will exist or on the other side if discount exist for carbon intense products that might be produced outside of in other people systems so that i d love to tell you that we have quantified what that number will be but that s really that looming question that we need to decide not only for elysis but for our portfolio because just transitioning back to the changes that we re making in alcoa in the existing portfolio that we have we have the benefit that we re making these changes because they re the right thing to do financially future proofing and cycle proofing our portfolio in smelting is the right thing to do we need to be in the first quartile because it s a rough and tumble business but also having the added benefit of then being the lowest carbon emitter of all the smelting systems in the world then positions us to capture that premium for elysis yes but even more importantly for the broader portfolio which the lot of tons as we emerge from there so to me it s the reason we talk more about this because i think it is a trend that is growing in importance i believe that at some point that premium or that discount will become more real but would not hazard to guess as to what that number is going to be at this point matthew korn goldman sachs analyst got it last quarter you did emphasize how much you saw sustainability is something tied in environment and also economics so we ll be watching carefully as this market develops thanks very much and good luck roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks matt william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks matt operator our next question will come from chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead christopher terry deutsche bank analyst hi roy and bill thanks for taking my question hi yeah the first question i had just thinking the big picture slide 23 where you go through it s not new i don t think but the target to get to 2 billion to 2 5 billion net debt including the pension just wanted to if you could given where you are at today if you could just step through a few of the pieces there so maybe as a start if you could split out maybe the target on net debt as opposed to the target on the overall pension and then if i just do the math on that you re trying to reduce that i guess 0 8 billion to 1 3 billion you should get another 200 million from the gum springs transaction and then if you do reach the upper end of your 1 billion 500 million to 1 billion asset sales target you take of most of that so there s not a lot of loud pouring actual cash flow am i reading that correctly i just wanted you to step through the latest and how you re seeing that goal that two to four year goal william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so one thing i would just start out by saying chris is if you look at page 40 that s the reconciliation of the net debt calculation so if we start there that would say that we re sitting at the end of 2019 at a 3 4 billion net debt calculation so to get to that level that we re targeting we would need to come off of that 3 4 billion essentially what we have said and first of all that was originally a three to five year target we are now making that a two to four year target because one year has passed we can get to that level of net debt by simply making our required minimum pension contributions there is a bunch of assumptions built into that and i ll tell you what those assumptions are we hit our expected return on assets 6 5 for the us varies across other parts of the world but the big number is 6 5 in the us and discount rates don t change substantially from where they are today so simply by making our minimum contributions we can do that that should then lead you to the question ok you started going down the path of 200 million of at least in the near term 200 million for gum springs an extra 50 million once we meet those post closing requirements and the additional asset sales and remember i would tell you that gum springs maybe we didn t say this but gum springs was included in our asset sale list so we ve executed now on nearly half of the bottom end layer of or level of that asset sale list so then we will use that cash and redeploy it in the capital allocation model that s on page 23 all right so that capital allocation model is pretty clear we won t have 1 billion of cash on the balance sheet we want to invest in the business in sustaining capital this year that will be 400 million we want to do small return seeking projects of 75 million this year and beyond that any excess free cash flow will be used for the four items down at the bottom essentially the debt reduction repositioning the portfolio the large say the mid size growth projects that we have and then returning cash to shareholders so that s the way you should be thinking about it and i just to circle back to your original point we think we can get to our net debt target simply by making our minimum pension contributions over the next few years christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks that s helpful i just had a couple of follow up on the cost side if we think about you ve gone through some of this already but just thinking about over the course of 2020 and then into the future as you want to move down toward the first quartile in the aluminum business just wanted if you could step through some of the opportunity particularly on the cost side and that s across all your business so maybe if you could discuss caustic carbon energy etc just directionally over the next say 12 months to 18 months thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i ll hit the raw materials piece first and then we can talk more broadly about some of the other things that will help us drive toward that first quartile you know that back in 2018 we saw significant cost headwinds in raw materials and 2018 s agent history at this point but we did see large increases 2019 was a year where we captured some of that back in raw materials 2020 i would tell you that that is accelerating the amount of reduction of raw materials in 2020 is larger than what we saw in 2019 i would project that we should see approximately 175 million of reduction in raw materials in 2020 that s coming from two areas that s first in caustic prices and then the second is in lower carbon prices so we are seeing some of that come back that we have seen higher costs over the last few years as far as addressing the repositioning our portfolio down to the first quartile that s going to be a combination of two things first is the asset review that we have we ve said that we have 1 5 metric tons of smelting capacity that will be either improved significantly sold or curtailed and then in addition to that and roy can speak more about this we re looking to really energize the productivity side of our business and to start to drive incremental cost savings not only in the smelters but on the refineries also roy c harvey president and chief executive officer and chris just to add a little bit on bill s last point and i won t belabor it but i think as we look toward this year s market and last year s market i think we ve regained a lot of stability across the portfolio but part of what we re trying to do with this operating model change is to make sure that we are being very clear in binary with each and every one of our plant managers about what success looks like for all of our plants and so that i believe will help us to drive a mentality about how to drive costs out of our plants as quickly as we possibly can and that is raw materials first and there is also a component of your usages of those raw materials and how smartly you can do that and when compared with the price of what you re using but it also connects over to maintenance costs to how you drive your plant to the choice about how you run electricity through your part so that you are giving the best financial outcomes so i think it s we re determined to see real improvements there i actually have a lot of confidence in our new operating team and we have some fresh people that are looking at problems that we ve been working on for the last decade and we are determined to make sure that that ends up being improvements in productivity and improvements in the end of our cost efficiencies so more to come in that certainly chris but it s it is really one of the most important things we ll be doing in 2020 and beyond christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks guys just one more if i may the capex guidance or sustaining capex of 400 million versus 290 million for 2019 is that 400 million is that the go forward rate we should expect in beyond 2020 as well or is there other items in that thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so just to put some characterization around the 400 million spent 290 million in 2019 the big difference between 2019 and 2020 are the two mine moves we ve got one in full swing down in australia in 2020 and we will just be starting one in brazil in 2020 both of those will be wrapped up in 2021 we haven t provided an outlook past 2020 but i think at least in the bauxite segment we will have elevated spending on the mine moves for the next couple of years and so that s what s driving it christopher terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks that s it from me roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks chris william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question will come from david gagliano with bmo please go ahead david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my questions i just have a couple of fairly quick ones first on the 35 million quarter over quarter decline in ebitda in the bauxite business how much of that is due to the seasonal volume decline and how much of that is due to the price decline william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer the price decline is the biggest piece of that dave out of the 35 million i would tell you probably two thirds of that is coming from both inter company and external pricing and the inter company clearly is picked up on the refining side but so out of the 35 million two thirds is priced and a third is seasonal lower volumes david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay and then just a related question on that as we think about that moving forward just for segment modeling purposes i m assuming that that piece that s price decline driven is pretty much reasonable run rate moving forward at this point correct william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah for 2020 we typically reset internal bauxite pricing once a year unless there is a major move in the marketplace that changes which we haven t really seen over the last couple of years so yeah i think assume that for 2020 david gagliano bmo capital markets analyst okay great and then just my other question slightly bigger picture when i look at the volume targets for 2020 they imply year over year growth of about 5 to 8 obviously there is a fairly cautious backdrop in terms of calling for global surplus in primary aluminum i get the becancour restart but my question really is without identifying specific assets how much of that 3 0 million to 3 1 million tons of third party shipments should we consider to be under review for curtailment realistically as we move through 2020 if prices stay soft and premiums continue to fade william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s really really difficult to answer dave when we look at the portfolio clearly there are some plants that are fairly high costs and we ll be looking at those in 2020 in light of market dynamics and those decisions will be made fairly quickly i can only point you to the fact that 90 days in to our announced strategy we already have closed or at least announced the closure of point comfort and have already executed on nearly half of the bottom end of the range on the asset sales so i would tell you we look at each plant we look at the run rate economics and we look at the current market environment and we ll make decisions fairly expeditiously operator our next question will come from lucas pipes with b riley fbr please go ahead lucas pipes b riley fbr inc analyst hey good afternoon everybody i ve quick follow up question on the gum springs transaction is that akin to a sale leaseback and if so what sort of ebitda contribution was this plant or would this plant be generating under the current under the structure that you agreed to would appreciate any color on that thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it is not a sale leaseback it is an out and out sale and it s a sale to veolia and as far as ebitda contribution in 2019 the plant lost 12 million we had kind of use of improving the plant to be a breakeven in 2020 so that gives you a pretty good indication of the contribution of gum springs to our financials we do have a mid term contract for processing spent potlining so we know that they will be taking our spl for a number of years but from my perspective this is a really good deal it gets the plant it s a good deal for alcoa it s a good deal for our shareholders but it s also a good deal for the plant it gets the plant to be owned by a company that s going to grow the capabilities and our employees that are alcoans say that are going to have a bright future so i think it s a really good transaction lucas pipes b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful and it s not like you re guaranteeing a certain number of profitability to the plant william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer no absolutely not i mean we will be sending our spl there for a number of years but we are not guaranteeing a profitability level lucas pipes b riley fbr inc analyst that s very helpful appreciate it and best of luck william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks lucas operator our next question will come from timna tanners with bank of america please go ahead timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah hey happy new year roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks timna william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey there so just to follow up on a few points i wanted to clarify if you could give us an update on tax for the portland complex and energy subsidies how to think about that complex going forward and then along the same lines how far along are we in terms of the benefit already being or still yet to come in terms of the becancour start up and the spanish smelter closure roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so let me start on portland essentially the deal that we agreed to was a 4 5 year deal and that will go out to the middle of 2021 and so in between now and that particular moment in time we need to see if there is a repowering solution or if there is another eventuality for that plant so in the midst of discussions with government it s a plant that operates very stably it is a very good it is a good technology it just happens to be one of the most highest energy price markets on the planet so you ll not see action on that in fact part of that agreement is that we wouldn t take action until the middle of 2021 on becancour your second question timna we re about halfway through the restart from a pot standpoint we actually have all employees will be back in the plant and back helping to tend those pots by the end of this month we re having a very good so far we re having a good start up i mean i ve been very pleased with it and it s an important situation where we ve been following this lockout for 18 months it is important for us to reestablish those connections with our employees but also it is an environment that takes a lot of care those becancour workers happen to be some of best that we have around our system so really positive to see how that is progressing so on the right track william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me throw some numbers around that on becancour timna when we announced becancour restart we said we would spend 30 million to 35 million after tax in the second half of 2019 and an additional 30 million to 35 million in the first half of 2020 we are actually the spending has probably been a little bit more back end loaded than what we anticipated so we spent about 25 million in the second half at becancour that gets pushed to the first half of 2020 so at this point we re not reducing our overall estimate of the spend put spain a little bit of perspective for you the fact that we have divested spain spain was about a 40 million ebitda hit in 2019 and that s before any of the special items that was just the operations so we won t have that ebitda hit in 2020 clearly since we don t own the asset we still have some payments that have to go out to our partner or the people who bought it who are known as partner and that s about 68 million that has to be done over the next six quarters so we still have that cash outflow over the next six quarters in that 68 million total timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay super helpful thank you william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer hope that helps timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah that s great thank you and then the only other question i wanted to ask is just taking a step back i know in the past you ve talked about thinking about cash returns to shareholders at above 1 billion in terms of cashing about it seems like you re getting close to that level but obviously also a lot of cash requirements into next year so i just wanted any updated thinking on is that you had 1 billion and you start to think about it or you want to position that for a couple of quarters or have those priorities changed or how you think about cash returns thanks william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the priorities clearly haven t changed the capital allocation model is the same as the one that we announced last quarter if we get to the 1 billion level we ll balance between those four items and as you said there are some things that are going to cost us cash the repositioning of the portfolio will cost us some cash but we ll balance what i would tell you is i was personally pleased with the fact that we generated cash in the four quarter again we generated cash in the third quarter these are fairly tough market environment and we generated cash and at the same time we made the contributions toward all the things that we needed to contribute toward so for instance we made our mandatory required pension contributions in the fourth quarter so from an overall perspective i would tell you that one of the bright spots in the quarter was the cash balance at the end of the year timna tanners bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay fair enough thanks again roy c harvey president and chief executive officer thanks timna operator our next question comes from john tumazos independent please go ahead john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you could you elaborate a little bit more on the chinese aluminum demand we read that vehicle sales fell 8 2 last year which are the markets were up in china and which are the markets are the one or two biggest markets for aluminum in china roy c harvey president and chief executive officer so that s a pretty broad question john so let me sort of couch it in terms of how we see that market growing into 2020 i don t know if i ll exactly hit where you were going with the question but hopefully at least it gives you the right direction william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer and as we ve done that we ll put some numbers down on it roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah so from when you look across the board the largest component sits inside of construction i think one of the highlights that people saw in the chinese market last year that you started to see building starts come back again unfortunately for last year aluminum really comes in at the end of the process so what we re hoping to see this year is that those building starts turn into building completions we have started to see that turn the corner as we come into 2020 and so that s going to help drive some growth in the construction market and happily that is the largest consumption of aluminum that happens inside of china from a transportation standpoint that one is also an important market we believe that the stimulus programs and what s happening in china is going to be driving that into a positive growth as well for this coming year i think it was a difficult 2019 i don t particularly have the negative 8 that you referenced but we should see that come back and in fact come back to be one of the strongest growth in the markets that we ll see across china i would just also mention that we continue to see some decent growth in packaging and foil in fact that growth will be down a little bit compared to the strong growth that we saw in 2019 that s a pretty big contributor to the overall aluminum consumption in china but i think we continue to see that aluminum as a packaging material continues to be strong and continues to grow william f oplinger executive vice president and chief financial officer no you hit all the things largely that i wanted to cover roy i mean the big market john is construction and roy addressed that the next kind of bigger markets are packaging and foil machinery transportation we did see transportation in a contraction like you did probably not the same level that you re referencing but we see that turning around pretty well in 2020 so those are the big markets john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah thanks john operator our next question will come from paretosh misra with berenberg please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg bank analyst thanks for taking my question just to follow up on a couple of other questions on the end market how close are you to your end market customer now given that you don t have any downstream business do you know every shipment going out of your facility whether it s going to construction or automotive or is that more about you having some market intelligence and market sources that s how you have a read in the end market demand roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah i d say paretosh that when we get to the actual aluminum consumption that goes into the end markets that is because of who we are alcoa corp instead of alcoa inc we are a step removed from that final end market so we put our effort into trying to understand what s coming out from other analysts and from what we hear and what we see in our sales of value added products in aluminum value added rolled products in aluminum so i think it s more an interpretation and not so much driven by what our what s coming out of our smelters we do have a pretty good idea of where our metal is going particularly when it comes to value added products so typically it is very different whether it s going into the can sheet or whether it s going into billet or extrusions etc but it s particularly for p1020 for the commodity grade that can go into any kind of use paretosh misra berenberg bank analyst got it and just a quick follow up on the aluminum shape premiums has there been any change this year versus last year i guess that s mostly a contract business roy c harvey president and chief executive officer yeah and the fact is that there has been a change and unfortunately it s not for the better is in fact a decline what we re seeing really and remember that we are very skewed toward north america and europe but we re seeing pretty significant declines for two reasons number one we ve seen that midwest premium come down and number two we ve seen product shape and alloy premiums also come down that i would tie it over to two things number one rusal come back into the market so if you remember at the end of 2018 i mean beginning of 2019 with most of those contracts were set for the 2019 annual year particularly in north america rusal was still under sanction so they were not able to step into a lot of those value added businesses for 2020 obviously the sanctions are behind them and thus they are now fully participating and are really driving to recapture market share so that is certainly having an impact on the amount of material that s available and number two and also important is because you had a period of such differentiated higher midwest premiums i think it attracted a decent amount of imported material that we re really starting to see coming into the 2020 markets you ve seen that come in i think that could change as we ve seen the best premiums come off their highs but at the same time we re seeing an more imports both from rusal and from others in the 2020 value added premium markets operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference to roy harvey for any closing remarks roy c harvey president and chief executive officer good thank you sean and i would like to thank everybody for your time and attention today we will continue to act aggressively to improve this company and to act on the strategic program that we ve set out and to make sure that we position ourselves for success into the future so thank you for joining us and we look forward to talking to you here three months down the road operator duration 76 minutes call participants james dwyer vice

broader market played catch up with benchmark indices in the past one month the nse midcap has delivered a return of 5 3 percent versus the nifty index s 3 4 percent and the same outperformance is likely to continue in the coming months if economic recovery takes place as per expectations experts feel story continues below advertisement remove ad the major reason behind this rally was the government s initiative to revive slowing economy that fell to 4 5 percent in q2fy20 and is expected to end the year with around 5 percent growth on the global front things started improving as the us and china signed phase one trade deal hopes of sops from the government in the upcoming budget has also lifted the sentiment we expect that the valuation gap between midcaps and large caps will narrow

advertisement remove ad the global brokerage expects moderate returns in 2020 due to the weak growth environment in the near term but hopes of major reforms are likely to keep investor interest high

investors now appear to see the fangs facebook apple amazon netflix and google s parent alphabet as more attractive havens thanks to their cash generating capacity photos ap comment in global capital markets a flight to quality was traditionally regarded as a change of sentiment where investors tried to minimise the risk of a loss of principal rather than chasing high returns that normally meant retreating into government bonds yielding a safe income us treasuries were seen as the ultimate bolt hole read more kiwi water bike company seeking to raise 10 million swamped at ces brokers picks the hot stocks to watch in 2020 why the wheels fell off china s tech boom ipo crashes send chills from wall street to silicon valley yet the flight to quality that came and went with the american killing of iranian military commander qassem soleimani did not square with that description investors who fled into the swiss franc or japanese yen both longstanding havens were exposing themselves to negative interest rates to call this quality borders on the oxymoronic given that holding swiss franc or yen government bonds to maturity would guarantee a loss of principal in reality though flights to quality have never been exclusively about trying to avoid capital loss because another favourite refuge in geopolitical economic or financial crises is gold a purely speculative asset yielding no income any dollar based investor who bought the yellow metal in a funk at the time of the second oil crisis in 1980 would have sustained heavy immediate losses and would have to wait more than two and a half decades before their investment was back in the black gold was also a terrible protection against the eurozone debt crisis investors who bought gold as a hedge before the greek government s partial default on its debts in march 2012 would have been showing persistent mark to market losses in euro terms until late last year that makes it all the more surprising that bitcoin surged on the soleimani killing prompting market talk of a new crypto gold for bitcoin is even more volatile and unpredictable than the yellow metal while it is independent decentralised and not under governmental control which some see as important advantages it satisfies very poorly the traditional criteria that define money namely being a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value and it lacks the trust that is generated for conventional money through independent and accountable central banks nor is there the regulatory apparatus supervision and deposit insurance that are provided for conventional money by the state as hyun song shin head of research at the bank for international settlements has pointed out trust in bitcoin can evaporate at any time because of the fragility of the decentralised consensus through which transactions are recorded this means that a cryptocurrency can simply stop functioning resulting in a complete loss of value returning to old fashioned securities it is clear that flights to quality and liquidity are different in the context of post crisis ultra loose monetary policy for a start because of the yield compression brought about by central banks asset buying programmes the flight is much shorter than in the past by the same token investors buying into havens need to recognise that they are fighting the central banks whose quantitative easing was designed precisely to push investors to take on more risk that is not a policy that invariably ends well at the same time the central banks own buying of government bonds causes a shrinking supply of paper leading to an increased liquidity premium in bond prices and vice versa when they stop buying or start selling dimitri vayanos of the london school of economics points out that such a liquidity premium is also affected by the behaviour of fund managers who may suffer withdrawals of funds if they underperform as often happens in periods of heightened volatility that vulnerability reduces managers willingness to hold illiquid assets and raises liquidity premia the extreme example of such behaviour came in 2007 08 when the problem became chronic even money market funds were regarded by investors as unsafe the resulting flight to quality caused treasury yields to collapse and created severe disruption in credit markets and other parts of the financial system at the same time gold and oil experienced record spikes because of the dollar s role as the world s pre eminent reserve currency and the centrality of wall street in the global financial system the flight to quality was magnified by huge capital inflows these days though the allure of treasuries is dimmed by the paltry yields they offer by historic standards it is not surprising then that investors now appear to see the fangs facebook apple amazon netflix and google s parent alphabet as more attractive havens thanks to their cash generating capacity rich balance sheets and deep liquidity in the marketplace all bar amazon are up sharply this year having already rallied strongly in 2019 there could be no better indication of how ultra loose monetary policy has turned longstanding conventions

zimbabwe signing of currency swop with china a desperate move spread the love mnangagwa with president xi jinping zimbabwe has joined japan south africa and nigeria in signing a currency swap deal with china which it hopes will improve trade between the two countries zimbabwe finance minister professor mthuli ncube confirmed the deal in an interview with the state media on the sidelines of a meeting between zimbabwean president emmerson mnangagwa and chinese foreign minister wang yi at the state house in harare the top chinese official is on a five african nation diplomatic offensive taking him to egypt djibouti eritrea burundi and zimbabwe beijing says the visit marks its two decades of the forum on china africa cooperation said ncube we have entered into a currency swap arrangement what this means is that there are those who would be investing in zimbabwe from china and those who require their proceeds to be remitted back to china which is normal he added so the idea is those individuals will then swap currency so that those who are investing in zimbabwe are able to give them a domestic currency and they use the foreign currency which they are bringing in for investment to pay those who are exiting harare under targeted sanctions by washington and the european union has increasingly turned to china for assistance some economists have warned that beijing is creating debt traps for desperate african nations like zimbabwe university of zimbabwe economics professor tony hawkins says zimbabwe service that the deal shows desperation on the part of zimbabwe to revive its struggling economy it s a sign of desperation of the times really you know the real issue for the economy is getting some kind of international agreement and all these policies that they re chasing after at the moment are all efforts to minimize the impact of not having access to imf money world bank money africa development bank money and so on hawkins says harare must address its economic crisis and stop fiddling around the edges of the problem rather than tackling the problem the chief executive officer of the zimbabwe national chamber of commerce chris mugaga concurs knowing fully well that zimbabwe is in a quagmire where the currency conundrum is hitting not only business but even the ordinary household so given that background i think this current swap is an attempt to find solutions especially to the current account deficit where china is the biggest beneficiary as you know we continue importing more from china than what we are selling to beijing economist dr godfrey kanyenze of the labor and economic development research institute of zimbabwe says the gresham law an economic term for filtering bad vs good currency will be in full swing as the strong chinese currency is set to chase away the weak zimbabwe currency known as bonds the problem is that the one chinese investor who is coming here to zimbabwe may have misgivings because of the context of chronic high inflation he adds the context of volatility and uncertainty which therefore implies that they may not really want to change their money in large amounts however investment banker gilbert muponda says the deal is likely to benefit harare which has been isolated by the west i think it s a welcome development because zimbabwe has been experiencing an acute shortage of foreign currency and this arrangement is going to reduce the demand of the us dollar because what it entirely means is that those people who are comfortable with receiving chinese yuan can match their requirements with those who have the yuan as well he continued the net effect is that you are going to avoid using the us dollar which is in short supply and selling at a premium so this is a good move by the two authorities as you know zimbabwe previously used to get a lot of money in terms of balance of payment in terms of payment support and grants and things like that and access to the imf which supported the currency now the lack of that support now is bringing extra pressure on the zimbabwe dollar therefore if you remove some of the people who are demanding the us dollar and they start using the chinese yuan it makes a lot of sense zimbabwe is facing its worst economic crisis in decades characterized by hyperinflation currency and fuel shortages and power outages that can go for 18 hours nearly eight million people roughly half the population are food insecure according to the world food program share this post like this like loading

dislocation in the business world as fossil fuel giants awaken to the need for renewable sources of energy and automakers accelerate investments in cleaner vehicles but measuring economic costs of climate change remains a work in progress we can assess the immediate costs of changing weather patterns and more frequent and intense natural disasters but most of the potential costs lie beyond the horizon of the typical economic analysis the economic impact of climate change will likely accelerate though not smoothly crucially for the coming generations the extent of the damage will depend on policy choices that we make today policymakers and investors increasingly recognize climate change s important implications for the financial sector climate change affects the financial system through two main channels see chart 1 the first involves physical risks arising from damage to property infrastructure and land the second transition risk results from changes in climate policy technology and consumer and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower carbon economy exposures can vary significantly from country to country lower and middle income economies are typically more vulnerable to physical risks for financial institutions physical risks can materialize directly through their exposures to corporations households and countries that experience climate shocks or indirectly through the effects of climate change on the wider economy and feedback effects within the financial system exposures manifest themselves through increased default risk of loan portfolios or lower values of assets for example rising sea levels and a higher incidence of extreme weather events can cause losses for homeowners and diminish property values leading to greater risks in mortgage

climate change bankruptcy gold 2019 rapid climatic changes caused prolonged droughts in california that dramatically increased the risk of fires from pacific gas and electric s operations tighter financial conditions might follow if banks reduce lending in particular when climate shocks affect many institutions simultaneously for insurers and reinsurers physical risks are important on the asset side but risks also arise from the liability side as insurance policies generate claims with a higher frequency and severity than originally expected there is evidence that losses from natural disasters are already increasing as a result insurance is likely to become more expensive or even unavailable in at risk areas of the world climate change can make banks insurers and reinsurers less diversified because it can increase the likelihood or impact of events previously considered uncorrelated such as droughts and floods transition risks materialize on the asset side of financial institutions which could incur losses on exposure to firms with business models not built around the economics of low carbon emissions fossil fuel companies could find themselves saddled with reserves that are in the words of bank of england governor mark carney 2015 literally unburnable in a world moving toward a low carbon global economy these firms could see their earnings decline businesses disrupted and funding costs increase because of policy action technological change and consumer and investor demands for alignment with policies to tackle climate change coal producers for example already grapple with new or expected policies curbing carbon emissions and a number of large banks have pledged not to provide financing for new coal facilities the share prices of us coal mining companies reflect this carbon discount as well as higher financing costs and have been underperforming relative to those of companies holding clean energy assets risks can also materialize through the economy at large especially if the shift to a low carbon economy proves abrupt as a consequence of prior inaction poorly designed or difficult to coordinate globally with consequent disruptions to international trade financial stability concerns arise when asset prices adjust rapidly to reflect unexpected realizations of transition or physical risks there is some evidence that markets are partly pricing in climate change risks but asset prices may not fully reflect the extent of potential damage and policy action required to limit global warming to 2 c or less central banks and financial regulators increasingly acknowledge the financial stability implications of climate change for example the network of central banks and supervisors for greening the financial system ngfs an expanding group that currently comprises 42 members has embarked on the task of integrating climate related risks into supervision and financial stability monitoring given the large shifts in asset prices and catastrophic weather related losses that climate change may cause prudential policies should adapt to recognize systemic climate risk for example by requiring financial institutions to incorporate climate risk scenarios into their stress tests in the united kingdom prudential regulators have incorporated climate change scenarios into stress tests of insurance firms that cover both physical and transition risks efforts to incorporate climate related risks into regulatory frameworks face important challenges however capturing climate risk properly requires assessing it over long horizons and using new methodological approaches so that prudential frameworks adequately reflect actual risks it is crucial to ensure that the efforts to bring in climate risk strengthen rather than weaken prudential regulation policies such as allowing financial institutions to hold less capital against debt simply because the debt is labeled as green could easily backfire through increased leverage and financial instability if the underlying risks in that debt have not been adequately understood and measured climate change will affect monetary policy too by slowing productivity growth for example through damage to health and infrastructure and heightening uncertainty and inflation volatility this can justify the adaptation of monetary policy to the new challenges within the limits of central bank mandates central banks should revise the frameworks for their refinancing operations to incorporate climate risk analytics possibly applying larger haircuts to assets materially exposed to physical or transition risks central banks can also lead by example by integrating sustainability considerations into the investment decisions for the portfolios under their management i e their own funds pension funds and to the extent possible international reserves as recommended by the ngfs 2019 in its first comprehensive report carbon pricing and other fiscal policies have a primary role in reducing emissions and mobilizing revenues see putting a price on pollution in this issue of f d but the financial sector has an important complementary role financial institutions and markets already provide financial protection through insurance and other risk sharing mechanisms such as catastrophe bonds to partly absorb the cost of disasters but the financial system can play an even more fundamental role by mobilizing the resources needed for investments in climate mitigation reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation building resilience to climate change in response to price signals such as carbon prices in other words if policymakers implement policies to price in externalities and provide incentives for the transition to a low carbon economy the financial system can help achieve these goals efficiently global investment requirements for addressing climate change are estimated in the trillions of us dollars with investments in infrastructure alone requiring about 6 trillion per year up to 2030 oecd 2017 most of these investments are likely to be intermediated through the financial system from this point of view climate change represents for the financial sector as much a source of opportunity as a source of risk the growth of sustainable finance the integration of environmental social and governance criteria into investment decisions across all asset classes shows the increasing importance that investors attribute to climate change among other nonfinancial considerations estimates of the global asset size of sustainable finance range from 3 trillion to 31 trillion while sustainable investing started in equities strong investor demand and policy support spurred issuance of green bonds growing the stock to an estimated 590 billion in august 2019 from 78 billion in 2015 banks are also beginning to adjust their lending policies by for example giving discounts on loans for sustainable projects sustainable finance can contribute to climate change mitigation by providing incentives for firms to adopt less carbon intensive technologies and specifically financing the development of new technologies channels through which investors can achieve this goal include engaging with company management advocating for low carbon strategies as investor activists and lending to firms that are leading in regard to sustainability all these actions send price signals directly and indirectly in the allocation of capital however measuring the impact that sustainable investments have on their environmental targets remains challenging there are concerns over unsubstantiated claims of assets green compliant nature known as greenwashing there is a risk that investors may become reluctant to invest at the scale necessary to counter or mitigate climate change especially if policy action to address climate change is lagging or insufficient the analysis of risks and vulnerabilities and advising its members on macro financial policies are at the core of the imf s mandate the integration of climate change risks into these activities is critical given the magnitude and global nature of the risks climate change is posing to the world

climate risks in financial statements can investors discern companies actual exposures to climate related financial risks there are promising efforts to support private sector disclosures of such risks but these disclosures are often voluntary and uneven across countries and asset classes comprehensive climate stress testing by central banks and supervisors would require much better data the imf supports public and private sector efforts to further spread the adoption of climate disclosures across markets and jurisdictions particularly by following the recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures 2017 greater standardization would also improve the comparability of information in financial statements on climate risks the potential impact of climate change compels us to think through in an empirical fashion the economic costs of climate change each destructive hurricane and every unnaturally parched landscape will chip away at global output just as the road to a low carbon economy will escalate the cost of energy sources as externalities are no longer ignored and old assets are rendered worthless on the other hand carbon taxes and energy saving

washington dc jan 16 ips climate change is already a reality ever more ferocious cyclones and extended droughts lead to the destruction of infrastructure and the disruption of livelihoods and contribute to mass migration actions to combat rising temperatures inadequate though they may have been so far have the potential to drive dislocation in the business world as fossil fuel giants awaken to the need for renewable sources of energy and automakers accelerate investments in cleaner vehicles but measuring economic costs of climate change remains a work in progress we can assess the immediate costs of changing weather patterns and more frequent and intense natural disasters but most of the potential costs lie beyond the horizon of the typical economic analysis the economic impact of climate change will likely accelerate though not smoothly crucially for the coming generations the extent of the damage will depend on policy choices that we make today policymakers and investors increasingly recognize climate change s important implications for the financial sector climate change affects the financial system through two main channels see chart 1 the first involves physical risks arising from damage to property infrastructure and land the second transition risk results from changes in climate policy technology and consumer and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower carbon economy exposures can vary significantly from country to country lower and middle income economies are typically more vulnerable to physical risks for financial institutions physical risks can materialize directly through their exposures to corporations households and countries that experience climate shocks or indirectly through the effects of climate change on the wider economy and feedback effects within the financial system exposures manifest themselves through increased default risk of loan portfolios or lower values of assets for example rising sea levels and a higher incidence of extreme weather events can cause losses for homeowners and diminish property values leading to greater risks in mortgage portfolios corporate credit portfolios are also at risk as

on january 15 president donald trump and china s vice premier liu he held a long anticipated ceremony in the east room of the white house to sign a phase one u s china trade deal the document entitled economic and trade agreement between the united states of america and the people s republic of china runs to 96 pages with eight chapters covering intellectual property technology transfer trade in food and agriculture products financial services macroeconomic policies and currency expanding trade and dispute resolution as part of the deal china has agreed to increase its purchases of u s goods and services by at least 200 billion over the next two years compared to 2017 imports for its part the united states will trim some tariffs but maintain them on 360 billion worth of chinese imports the bulk of the bilateral trade the deal is written like a traditional trade agreement with a range of substantive and process commitments by both sides that will only be as strong as the degree to which they are implemented by both sides for now it puts a pause on trade tensions between the world s two largest economies that had been escalating for much of the past two years however it leaves many structural issues notably chinese subsidies and other industrial policies unaddressed whether when and how phase two negotiations between the two sides move ahead remains unclear q1 what did the two sides agree to on intellectual property a1 china s theft of u s intellectual property and its relatively weak intellectual property ip protections were among the original core complaints highlighted in the office of the u s trade representative s ustr section 301 report china has made commitments to improve its intellectual property environment in the past however the phase one agreement includes some procedural innovations that may result in better monitoring implementation and enforcement of china s obligations the agreement requires that china publish an action plan that details how and when china will implement its ip obligations the agreement also requires that china increase ip enforcement actions in a number of areas and regularly publish data on the impact of those actions the action plan along with regularly published data on ip enforcement should provide the united states benchmarks to measure china s implementation of its obligations the phase one agreement requires that china beef up its intellectual property regime in a number of areas including in connection to counterfeit and pirated goods and pharmaceuticals it also requires that china improve its protection of trade secrets and business confidential information china has also agreed to harsher penalties for ip theft in order to deter theft from occurring notably the chapter does not require the united states to change or introduce any new measures rather it affirms that the existing u s measures comply with the obligations in the ip chapter q2 how significant are the agricultural commitments a2 u s agricultural exports to china have plummeted since 2017 when china was the united states second largest destination for agricultural and related products amid the winnowing of a massive export market two years of terrible weather and collapsing commodity prices farm bankruptcies and total farm debt reached record levels in 2019 the phase one agreement on agriculture will provide two much needed shots in the arm for farmers chinese purchasing commitments are the first shot in the arm the agreement requires that china purchase at least 40 billion in u s agricultural and related products annually for the next two years while that purchase commitment locks china in as a destination for u s crops and keeps u s farmers busy it is not clear that the united states can supply that amount of agricultural goods to china at a minimum the united states may have to divert exports that would have gone to other markets to china also unclear is whether china would allow itself to become more reliant on u s agricultural imports than ever before or whether u s farmers are willing to put all their eggs in the china basket u s agricultural exports to china peaked in 2013 when u s farmers sent some 29 billion worth of product to china 11 billion below the phase one obligation finally purchasing commitments are more in line with a state driven economic model than a market driven model the latter of which the united states aims for china to adopt the second shot in the arm comes from the elimination of chinese non tariff barriers which have limited a variety of u s agricultural exports the elimination of those barriers should create more long lasting structural improvement in the outlook for agricultural exports to china q3 what commitments does the agreement include on currency and financial market opening a3 commitments under the macroeconomic policies and exchange rate matters chapter of the phase one agreement do not go beyond what has already been agreed in the context of the g20 specifically to refrain from competitive devaluations and the targeting of exchange rates for competitive purposes and the international monetary fund imf specifically to avoid exchange rate manipulation in fact transparency commitments under the agreement explicitly acknowledge the absence of new commitments indicating the united states and china shall continue to disclose publicly international reserves and balance of payments data what is new is the potential dilution of treasury s role when it comes to resolving any disputes which will be directed to the bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution arrangement under ustr ustr in turn may consult with other agencies but there is no obligation putting treasury in a secondary role on macroeconomic and exchange rate matters on this point it s worth noting the agreement s affirmation of monetary policy autonomy for both the united states and china and that either party may request the involvement of the imf another aspect of the agreement is the tension between exchange rate flexibility long the goal of u s engagement with china on exchange rates and exchange rate stability this tension likely reflects u s concerns that market forces may well weaken the chinese renminbi against the dollar a sentiment reflected in treasury s most recent foreign exchange report which while it lifted the august 2019 designation of china as a currency manipulator noted concern with continued dollar strength similarly the financial services chapter largely affirms market opening commitments made by vice premier li last summer to end foreign investor ownership limits in the financial sector in 2020 on the margins specific pledges for instance taking a parent company s overseas assets into account when granting licenses in china should lower barriers to entry in the chinese market while the enforcement mechanism may help achieve greater compliance with these commitments while the chapter emphasizes the mutually beneficial nature of market opening the idea may be challenged by an increased sensitivity to national security factors in both countries despite the traditional chinese focus on reciprocity in negotiated documents u s commitments in the financial services chapter essentially boil down to the united states acknowledging pending chinese applications in banking insurance and securities sectors q4 how strong is the enforcement component of the agreement a4 if measured by size coming in at just six pages the bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution chapter is the least significant element of the deal but that doesn t do justice to the significance of this component which is relatively clear and straightforward there is a tiered process at the top will sit the u s trade representative and designated vice premier and below them the deputy u s trade representative and a designated vice minister for day to day matters both sides will create a bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution office if one side feels the other party isn t keeping to their commitments it may submit an appeal to the other side if the standing offices can t reach a resolution the dispute is escalated to the deputies and then to the top leaders should no resolution be achieved the complaining party may resort to taking action based on facts provided during the consultations including by suspending an obligation under this agreement or by adopting a remedial measure in a proportionate way that it considers appropriate with the purpose of preventing the escalation of the situation and maintaining the normal bilateral trade relationship critically should one side take such a remedial action the agreement states that the other side is forbidden from taking counter penalties instead the only remedy is to withdraw from the agreement which either party can do with 60 day written notice other u s trade agreements have had enforcement provisions but this one is distinctive in the level of unilateral authority it gives both parties although u s commitments are most often summarized by the statement the united states affirms that existing u s measures afford treatment equivalent to that provided for in this article china would also be within its rights to adopt penalties should it find the united states not in compliance and the united states itself could not respond in kind what is unclear is how broadly the agreement applies to the relationship it appears that enforcement only applies to the specific commitments in this agreement but one can expect that there will be pressure from the u s side for other issues outside the deal to be addressed through this process conversely another challenge will be what happens when either side takes market restricting actions that they claim are not related to this agreement yet the other side finds discriminatory and broadly relevant to the trade relationship in sum although the enforcement element of the deal looks rather robust and could help keep china to its commitments it is also possible to see how this element is not airtight and could generate unforeseen challenges in the future as a result successful enforcement will depend heavily on the consistent good faith effort of both sides matthew p goodman is senior vice president senior

by sonal desai ph d chief investment officer franklin templeton fixed income the many gloomy predictions for 2019 did not come to pass but can we be more optimistic for 2020 franklin templeton fixed income cio sonal desai draws the key lessons from last year and outlines what we should expect for the year ahead and her main concerns with political uncertainty top of the list new year new decade we re off to the races i have a few concerns about 2020 and some ideas on how to make it a successful year from an investment perspective which i have just shared in barron s 2020 roundtable in new york but before i delve into that let me elaborate on the lessons of 2019 and the underlying trends carrying us into the new year none of the doom and gloom predictions materialized in 2019 trade tensions did not spiral into out of control trade wars new tariffs affected selected companies and industries but they did not have a major macro impact the us economic expansion did not halt it went on to become the longest in history with unemployment at a 50 year low china s economy did not stall it just slowed to a still healthy 6 gross domestic product gdp growth rate us stock markets had a great year albeit with a massive assist from the federal reserve the s p 500 index ended up nearly 30 and the nasdaq more than 35 the best performance in six years for both indexes and the dow jones industrial average gained 22 1 a wall of worries the lesson in my view is that last year too many people in the media and in the markets worried too much about the wrong things here s what i think we should expect and in some cases worry about in 2020 i believe us politics will be the main source of volatility as we head toward the 2020 us presidential election in november some of the leading democratic contenders have policy platforms that echo the obama presidency while others have put forward proposals that would fundamentally alter the business environment with a likely severe negative impact on growth and markets even with a divided congress a new administration could enact substantial regulatory changes via executive order as the current administration has done i think the extent to which de regulation measures over the past three years have supported economic growth has been seriously underappreciated and we are similarly underestimating the negative impact that a rapid resurgence in regulations could have on the other side a second term for us president donald trump would most likely involve a continuation of the policy by tweet pattern that has already proved disruptive in terms of market volatility and business investment uncertainty as the november election draws nearer i expect uncertainty on the course of future economic policy will weigh more heavily on markets regardless of who wins us public spending and debt are likely to keep growing which would make current us treasury valuations look even more stretched the markets and the fed tug of war the tug of war between the markets and the fed is likely to resume in 2019 when the markets put the pressure on the fed capitulated stocks ended up about 30 in a year when corporate earnings were broadly flat with the fed s interest rate cuts playing the determining role this cannot be a comfortable situation for a central bank in 2020 i think the fed will aim to stay put and keep short term rates anchored at current levels this will be too accommodative for what i expect to be another year of healthy real us gdp growth at about 2 5 2 75 however the fed can give itself additional cover with its ongoing monetary policy strategy review likely to favor some form of average inflation rate targeting which would imply greater tolerance for a period of above target inflation i also expect inflation will rise above the 2 target the question is by how much the very tight us labor market has begun to fuel a visible acceleration in corporates labor costs the share of small firms reporting that labor costs are their most important problem is far higher than at any time in the past 40 years even a moderate increase in consumer inflation if quick enough might make investors nervous and push long term rates up more than markets expect the idea that inflation is no longer a concern widely embraced by policymakers and analysts is a dangerous assumption technological changes and globalization have had a disinflationary impact on goods and services but there is no guarantee that will last forever meanwhile loose monetary policy has fueled asset price inflation confirming that the liquidity does end up causing inflation somewhere the current accepted wisdom holds that we are in secular stagnation that growth in advanced economies will be perennially slow because weak aggregate demand will depress investment and bond yields forever it concludes that we need a perennially loose monetary policy and greater public spending and that these policies carry no risk since inflation is dead and debt is free the period of relative macroeconomic stability from the mid 1980s on known as the great moderation used to enjoy the same unquestioning acceptance until it didn t economics has not yet found a convincing explanation of why inflation remains muted even with a record strong labor market i think it s unwise to fully trust something we don t fully understand so i am concerned by this carefree push for looser monetary and fiscal policy from top economists like larry summers urging us to stop worrying and love the debt to mmt s modern monetary theory magical thinking that there is no budget constraint we are sowing the seeds of financial instability to be triggered at the first signs that secular stagnation is not so secular after all but merely another transitory phase i also think the discussion on growth prospects has too quickly dismissed the supply side of the equation because productivity growth has been sluggish over the past decade many economists have assumed it will always be slow and have focused on how to boost aggregate demand this underestimates the potential of digital innovations making their way through all sectors of the economy from finance to manufacturing here i see an impatient schizophrenic attitude on the one hand we agonize over the disruption in our own industries and debate how to handle the imminent automation of most jobs on the other hand we assume there will be no positive impact on productivity and growth because we haven t seen one yet but implementing these new technologies takes time it requires new skills organizational changes new ways of running and managing the business it s true in finance and it s even more true in industry it takes time but it s already happening nobel prize economist robert solow declared in 1987 that you can see the computer revolution everywhere except in the productivity statistics a few years later productivity growth doubled an important lesson worth keeping in mind today as other economists compare the hype of artificial intelligence and robotics to the sluggish productivity growth and conclude that new innovations have no growth boosting power adaptive expectations are a dangerous bias trade war fears overblown but still rustling trade tensions are here to stay the december phase one agreement between china and the united states confirmed that fears of trade wars were overblown but let s not take it as a major cause for optimism while president trump s aggressive 140 character approach to trade policy has at times caused volatility it is important to recognize that both republicans and democrats have shifted to a more critical attitude toward globalization regardless of how next year s elections play out the global trade environment has changed in a structural fashion the economic and strategic competition between the united states and china will only grow more intense as china keeps investing in advanced technologies the global shift to greater nationalism will also prove long lived this will not cause trade wars and a global recession in my view but from an investment perspective i expect it will keep impacting specific companies and industries and it will keep shifting the relative competitiveness and attractiveness of different countries what to expect in 2020 overall i do not expect any dramatic shifts in the macro outlook in 2020 if anything i believe the consensus remains too pessimistic i think global growth should remain on an even keel with us gdp growth at 2 5 2 75 the eurozone around 1 and china around 6 2 we will again face significant volatility from multiple sources including political uncertainty geopolitics and the media s instinct to hype just about every risk that emerges on the horizon how should investors approach 2020 in part 2 of the barron s 2020 roundtable which will be published this coming saturday january 18 2020 i elaborate on the investment implications of this complex environment and offer my key recommendations so stay tuned meanwhile i wish you all a successful 2020 it definitely promises to be an eventful and interesting year what are the risks all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates thus as prices of bonds in an investment portfolio adjust to a rise in interest rates the value of the portfolio may decline changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond s credit rating may affect its value investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors in addition to those associated with these markets smaller size lesser liquidity and lack of established legal political business and social frameworks to support securities markets such investments

amid the current furor over qasem soleimani s killing the united states recently threatened to impose sanctions on iraq should its government insist on a us troop withdrawal from that country it is important to explore the impact such sanctions would have in the 1990s saddam hussein s regime was the target of a blunt and widespread embargo that while limiting the country s access to the international financial system carried with it an extensive humanitarian toll those sanctions coupled with the new challenges associated with the 9 11 attacks motivated a fundamental reconsideration of how the us treasury should use sanctions similarly the potential sanctions against iraq under consideration now could damage the united states goals in that country and would only embolden iran s position the exact scenario that us policy has tried to avoid economic countermeasures such as restrictions to iraq s federal reserve accounts could not only cede economic clout within iraq to tehran but could also have significant impact on the us dollar s global position in the decades that followed the unsuccessful iraq embargo washington s sanctions strategy shifted from broad embargoes to targeted scalpel like measures designed to maximize pain while minimizing collateral damage the iranian sanctions in the 2010s proved the potential successes of this approach banks and firms not only in iran but also across the middle east lost access to dollar clearing due to their participation in tehran s terrorism proliferation efforts additionally iran s oil exports were severely curtailed by an oil embargo in the eu and a global waiver program that stipulated large volume reductions by key buyers such as china and india these sanctions were overall successful they resulted in significantly less humanitarian catastrophe than previous ones and they drove tehran to negotiate the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa today the trump administration is keen on ratcheting up its maximum pressure strategy on tehran but it is increasingly limited by the lack of sanctions ammunition left to deploy after several months of increasingly provocative iranian actions in the region such as seizing tankers and targeting saudi arabia s production facilities the administration deployed a kinetic response to the death of a us contractor and an imminent threat to the us embassy the move was successful in claiming the life of one of the region s worst actors responsible for the deaths of thousands in syria alone but it caused uncertainly in the future of the ability to keep us troops in iraq as iraqi politicians have quickly called for a us withdrawal to rebuff this attempt which would only strengthen tehran s position in iraq the us administration threatened baghdad with economic penalties if they forced us troops to leave on january 10 the federal reserve bank of new york frbny leveraged iraq s access to its accounts at the frbny and heralded a redeployment of harsh sanctions previously deployed in 2015 that radical step to limit iraq s access to its foreign currency accounts was meant to ensure that the country s dollars were not flowing into the hands of rogue actors linked to iran and isis when iraq exports its oil abroad the country receives payment in us dollars not iraqi dinars the local currency and provides baghdad with valuable hard currency to purchase other goods when other countries export consumer goods to iraq payment in us dollars the global reserve currency is far preferable to payment in the iraqi dinar the iraqi central bank deposits these dollars at the frbny where it can receive them upon request periodically the iraqi central bank will call upon these reserves to meet the needs of the local economy the central bank auctions dollars to banks and exchange houses many of which have deficient anti money laundering programs when this access was previously restricted in 2015 the us treasury and state department used the alleged involvement of rogue actors in the central bank s auction to justify the decision the move was intended not as a permanent expulsion but as a powerful incentive to change baghdad s behavior on the issue isis had been raising as much as 20 to 25 million per month by accessing the flow of dollars in the country while rogue iranian banks like bank melli and bank parsian were later revealed to have accessed the auctions the need for action was serious but shortly thereafter iraqi authorities deepened their engagement with washington and the restrictions were rolled back against a growing tide of opposition to washington s unilateral restrictions on dollar clearing the threat to weaponize frbny accounts today is an even more dangerous step as it questions the position of the dollar and the federal reserve in the global market virtually no other global currency can meet the needs of global investors in the same way that the dollar can capital controls and other policy restrictions for example remain serious impediments to the chinese renminbi s growth however even if the dollar remains a dominant global currency the federal reserve is not the sole provider of dollars when shipments to the united arab emirates had been interrupted by terrorist actions local institutions turned to other institutions in the global marketplace to meet their dollar needs this is also not the first time that sanctions have awakened concerns about access to reserves in 2014 the central bank of russia allegedly made a major withdrawal but shortly moved its funds back into its fed account unlike the sanctions on iran the russian sanctions package limited russian firms access to financing in euro and dollar denominated capital markets while still preserving russia s ability to sell energy in global markets and sparing the central bank from the brunt of policy action nevertheless this year saw russia dump much of its treasury holdings shifting the proceeds into euros and yuan as washington has debated new sanctions measures threatening iraq s frbny access is not only dangerous due to its unprecedented scale but also due to its punitive nature sanctions are most effective at incentivizing nations when a clear off ramp is present and there is a credible promise of economic benefits in exchange for policy coordination it may not take a full withdrawal order from baghdad for sanctions to be imposed for some time russia has been exploring a potential sale of its s400 missile system to iraq mirroring turkey s earlier acquisition turkey s purchase has come under significant scrutiny due to the country s participation in the f 35 program with many in congress viewing the transaction as worthy of sanctions under the caatsa law though the administration has a choice of a wide variety of options economic countermeasures aimed at baghdad could be seriously counterproductive to us efforts in the country if imposed the only clear victor would be iran iran s economic influence in iraq has lagged its formidable security clout owing to both the country s weaker economy and the existing sanctions regime on tehran s international transactions still tehran is a critical supplier of natural gas and electricity to the iraqi power grid which suffers from periodic spikes in demand during the hot summers the iraqi electricity system has suffered from both the lingering efforts of the iraq war and attacks by isis with iranian exports responsible for as much as a third of the country s capacity these exports are critical to the iraqi economy justifying their waiver under the current sanctions package aimed at iran all of iraq s payments are paid in iraqi dinars not in dollars and must be spent on iraqi humanitarian goods in a similar setup to europe s instex mechanism us sanctions on iraq could significantly bolster iran s economic clout into the region iran has long sought to use iraq as a means of sanctions evasion so isolating the iraqi economy could boost such efforts while enabling iran to use its proxies in iraq to build patronage networks iraq s popular mobilization forces largely sponsored by iran already compete with baghdad in the provision of security and over time could also rival the state in the provision of other public goods like welfare services or infrastructure there are few benefits if any to sanctions on iraq if the united states does move forward with this strategy it may come to seriously regret its actions michael b greenwald is a fellow at harvard kennedy school s belfer center for science and

well look a phase one might happen because a phase one is insignificant the real deal is supposedly phase two that s the one that s not going to happen so if anybody thinks we re going to have a substantive deal they re wrong but the reality is i think the chinese yuan is undervalued relative to the dollar and i expect it to rise rather dramatically over time it s going to make imports more expensive for americans so it s going to reduce our standard of living and i do think ultimately it s going to push up interest rates as well as the chinese and a lot of other creditors are no longer lending money to americans and so we have to draw from our own savings pool which is extremely shallow it means the federal reserve is going to be printing a lot more money as it monetizes the debt that the chinese and other nations no longer want to buy and this is further going to lower the american standard of living they did that deliberately because they wanted to maintain exports to the united states but i think that was a key mistake i mean it helped america because we got to live beyond our means but i don t think it did anything for the chinese economy it helped undermine it because they accumulated a huge pool of us dollars and they ended up doing things with that created malinvestments and other distortions i think the best thing that can happen to china is simply to allow their currency to appreciate to reduce their exports to the united states because we can t afford to pay for those products to let their own nation consume that production so that their own people can benefit from their hard work but unfortunately americans are going to have a rude awakening when all of a sudden we have to live within our means and our means have been dramatically diminished over the years we haven t been investing we haven t been saving we ve been relying on an overvalued currency to import what the rest of the world produces and we haven t saved very much we ve just been borrowing to consume and all this is going to come back to bite us i think with this this is a bubble it s going to pop i agree there s no way to know how much air they ll successfully blow into it the minute it drops everybody says the correction is over you gotta buy the dip so i think most people are going to watch all their paper profits vanish it s not just going to be that people are going to lose dollars when the stock market bubble pops but the dollar bubble is even bigger and when that pops even the dollars you haven t lost are going to lose most of their value so i think americans are going to be wiped out in the us stock market and the bond market i mean people are going to be surprised at how much of their wealth they lose playing it safe in the bond market because you re not playing safe you re playing with dynamite there there are no us dollar denominated assets that can be considered safe right now it is a giant casino and yeah you know people think the economy is good because they managed to blow more air into the stock market bubble and the bond market bubble but the economy is in worse shape now than it s ever been it s in far worse shape than it was before trump took office mainly because he continued to pursue the failed policies of obama who pursued the failed policies of bush well i m sure over the long term there will be a recovery but in the short run certainly this will weigh on our exports which also could weigh on the dollar you know i ve been thinking the us dollar was headed lower anyway but if we end up with bigger trade deficits in part because we have fewer exports of aircraft that is going to be another factor of many that i think will be weighing down the dollar and the us economy on jan 13 peter schiff appeared on rt boom bust with bubba horwitz to talk about the yuan the dollar the stock market and the us economy the chinese yuan has been gaining strength against the dollar in recent weeks in part because of optimism that there will eventually be a resolution to the trade war but the chinese currency is still over 17 lower than it was when the us imposed its first tariffs does this mean the markets are cautiously positioning for a deal or is there still skepticism about the phase 1 deal peter focused on the bigger picture peter said this is not good news for the us horwitz said it s hard to get a read on the yuan because it doesn t trade freely it s always pinned by the chinese government he said he thinks the chinese will keep their currency low as long as they can to offset tariffs and keep americans buying their goods he said he doesn t agree with peter at all that the yuan will explode to the upside peter said be that as it may the chinese have made a mistake undervaluing their currency and they ll eventually figure that out the stock markets continue to go up despite a lot of bad economic data horwitz said stocks will continue to go up until they don t but at some point the

nzd outperforms on u s china deal housing data bests a struggling gbp as economy and boe weigh market no longer expects rbnz rate cuts this year but is increasingly pricing in boe cuts from january friday s uk retail sales month end budget in focus image adobe stock gbp nzd spot rate 1 9632 down 0 36 for today indicative bank rates for transfers 1 8940 1 9082 transfer specialist indicative rates 1 9337 1 9455 get your quote now the new zealand dollar outperformed rivals including pound sterling on thursday and if recent developments at the respective central banks are anything to go by it could continue to best its british counterpart for a while yet new zealand s dollar topped the major currency league table wednesday as investors revelled over the possible global economic relief offered by wednesday s signing of the long elusive phase one deal to temporarily end the trade war between the u s and china however there were also other reasons behind the market s bid for the kiwi new zealand s housing market continues to fire national house prices rose 1 2 in december to hit 6 6 in annual terms and housing sales surged 12 3 year over year the risk is growing the rbnz won t have to cut rates again which is nzd positive says elias haddad a strategist at commonwealth bank of australia cba usd will continue to trade on the defensive as long as the outlook for the global economy improves the pound to new zealand dollar rate was down 0 36 at 1 9624 early in the european session although it s up 0 13 for 2020 while the nzd usd rate was up 0 46 at 0 6652 but is still down 1 01 for this year above pound to new zealand dollar rate shown at hourly intervals it s an open question as to whether the global economy will really benefit from the pact that s set to suspend trade hostilities at least through the bulk of 2020 but new zealand s commodity and china exposed currency had previously declined against all majors through early january and so was back in demand on thursday aided by domestic housing data new zealand s dollar underperformed in 2019 but closed the gap between it and rivals in a considerable way by year end as markets priced out the once significant implied probability of further interest rate cuts from the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz this year pricing in the overnight index swap market has shifted considerably since the days before the u s china trade deal was first announced on october 11 at the beginning of that month pricing implied a june 24 rbnz cash rate of 0 49 suggesting strongly that investors saw a further two cuts to the 1 benchmark as a certainty for the first half of 2020 and the implied cash rate for november 2019 was at that time just 0 73 implying investors thought one rate cut was a certainty even before the turn of the year however the u s china trade deal changed all of that while third quarter economic growth numbers as well as the recent government budget have helped cement the turnaround in the market s view of the outlook for new zealand when combined those factors have seen the kiwi go from being the currency market s biggest short to a much more supportive position above nzd usd rate shown at daily intervals as investors curtailed their long usd positions in the past few weeks it is no surprise the nzd appeared as a valid alternative to reallocate their bullish views says francesco pesole a strategist at ing the rbnz neutral shift late last year is offering a supportive rate environment compared to its main peer aud and a medium term undervaluation still points at upside potential as long as a benign risk environment holds at this stage we do not exclude nzd moving into positive territory in the near future third quarter economic growth was stronger than expected in new zealand while earlier numbers were also revised higher in spite of the u s china trade war that left the global economy badly damaged meanwhile the rbnz revealed in the minutes of its latest policy meeting that it s less worried about the implications of the tariff fight for new zealand since the country s export commodity prices have still risen and boosted national income throughout the conflict and the government has since announced its first wellbeing budget in which it committed to spend a sizeable 10 bn on investment projects over the coming years which is equivalent to around 3 of gdp investors are no longer short the kiwi dollar in substantial part because they no longer expect any further rate cuts from the rbnz this year or next pricing in the ois market now implies a june cash rate of 0 89 which is slightly lower than the current 1 rate but still some way above the next level down of 0 75 and the implied the cash rates for subsequent months particularly toward year end are higher than that in other words speculators are no longer much of a weight around the ankles of the new zealand dollar which might mean the kiwi can sustain its thursday outperformance for a while yet the latest data dump has motivated markets to expect a boe cut later this month the ois market prices in a 65 chance of a cut at the january meeting says mark mccormick north american head of fx strategy at td securities outperformance is entering the pipeline for the kiwi at the same time as pound sterling is at increasing risk of underperforming due to the mounting possibility that the bank of england boe will cut its own interest rate on january 30 inflation is well below target and gdp growth was just 0 6 in the 12 months to the end of november which leaves its substantially below the economy s estimated 1 25 inflation producing rate of growth above pound to new zealand dollar rate shown at weekly intervals the monetary policy committee now appears to have a majority in favour of a rate cut that s not yet fully priced by the market with earlier stand pat voters having turned dovish over the last week governor mark carney silvana tenreyro and gertjan vlieghe all indicated in recent days that they ll vote for a rate cut at the end of this month if the outlook doesn t improve while michael saunders and jonathan haskell already voted to cut in december that makes for five out of nine who re potentially in favour of easing and if rates are cut once there s no telling what else investors might then price in our own view is that the boe can afford to wait a few months to see if the risks around the labour market materialise to monitor how the economy performs in the first quarter and to get a better indication of the government s spending plans due to be unveiled in the budget on 11 march however the mpc s decision is likely to be close and the pmi prints on the 24th january could be crucial to swaying the final vote in two weeks says marchel alexandrovich a senior economist at jefferies international the ois market sees a 0 75 boe bank rate falling to only 0 60 by month end which leaves the pound to new zealand dollar rate especially vulnerable to declines in the weeks ahead it also means there s a lot riding on friday s december retail sales figures the tuesday 21 jobs figures and the friday 24 flash pmi surveys of the uk s three main industries from ihs markit however sterling bears run the risk of seeing the pound offered salvation by hm treasury on wednesday 29 january when the autumn forecast statement is released that ll reveal updated government forecasts for the economy as well as providing markets with a sneak peak at the march budget that s expected to see the new government of prime minister boris johnson splash as much as 60 bn of cash in order to get the economy going again pound sterling will scrutinise the statement closely because any large stimulus might lessen the perceived need for boe rate cuts above pound to new zealand dollar rate shown at weekly intervals
definition of an economic recession a recession is a period of economic decline signaled by an increase in unemployment a drop in the stock market and a dip in the housing market an official recession is not declared until the total value of goods and services in the u s called the gross domestic product or gdp has been in decline for two or more quarters six months or more what causes a recession depending upon which economist you ask the united states is currently suffering through either its 45th or 47th recession what s remarkable is that no two have been exactly alike there are however characteristics that most recessions have in common high interest rates high inflation or both high interest rates limit the amount of money available to borrow and can signal the beginning of a recession inflation refers to a rise in prices of everyday goods and services we purchase like groceries gasoline and consumer items high interest rates limit the amount of money available to borrow and can signal the beginning of a recession inflation refers to a rise in prices of everyday goods and services we purchase like groceries gasoline and consumer items real wages don t buy as much the term real wages refers to how far our incomes stretch for example if you earn 60 000 in one city you might be able to buy a home and live a fairly comfortable life that same 60 000 is not going to stretch nearly as far in a more expensive area though as a recession begins real wages across the country begin to shrink the term real wages refers to how far our incomes stretch for example if you earn 60 000 in one city you might be able to buy a home and live a fairly comfortable life that same 60 000 is not going to stretch nearly as far in a more expensive area though as a recession begins real wages across the country begin to shrink once real wages begin to shrink consumers lose confidence as they realize that their income is not keeping pace with inflation they stop spending as much which contributes to an overall slowdown in fact one of the reasons the u s government passed a 2 trillion stimulus package in march was to keep americans spending money and the economy chugging along until the novel coronavirus threat has passed what happens during a recession like a snowball growing larger as it rolls down a hill a recession gathers power as one economic indicator after another gets caught up here s how that happens gdp falls economic activity becomes shaky and companies cut back in an attempt to survive these corporate cutbacks lead to layoffs and unemployment watching other people get laid off causes those who are still employed to worry that they are going to lose their jobs which leads to less consumer spending government debt rises as it attempts to stabilize the economy the federal reserve cuts interest rates in an attempt to stimulate growth stocks and other assets like homes lose value and a full fledged financial crisis is underway how long does a recession last although the great recession lasted for 18 months it was unusual if you take it out of the equation the other 10 recessions since world war ii have lasted between six and 16 months or an average of 10 4 months it s important to note that the u s economy falls apart and rebuilds itself quite regularly what set the great recession apart from other recessions was how long it took to rebuild the same may be true of the current recession what s the difference between a recession and depression for those asking what is a recession it s important to know that a recession is not as severe as a depression a recession marks the contraction phase of a business cycle when everything slows down for at least two quarters in contrast as the great depression showed depression is a prolonged period of economic downturn during which a significant decline in economic indicators occurs in short these two factors set a depression apart from a recession severity when economic indicators contract or weaken for two quarters it is considered a recession a depression causes economic indicators to decline more significantly when economic indicators contract or weaken for two quarters it is considered a recession a depression causes economic indicators to decline more significantly length a depression is deeper and lasts longer than a recession for example the great depression of 1929 lasted 43 months whereas the great recession lasted 18 months what was the worst recession in history prior to the current recession the great recession of 2007 2009 was considered the most severe the imf ranks it as the second worst downturn of all time behind only the great depression the great recession was fueled by the collapse of the u s real estate market which was caused by a subprime mortgage crisis banks giving mortgages to people who were clearly unable to repay the debt like the current financial crisis the great recession was the perfect storm for a downturn subprime mortgages were the first snowball at the top of the hill homeowners who had gotten in over their heads began to default on their loans as defaults dotted the real estate market home values plummeted even those who did keep up on their mortgages suddenly lost equity the stock market quickly followed worried investors sold their stocks quickly next banks collapsed much of the world economy was sucked down with ours part of the recovery process included new legislation designed to prevent the same kind of financial crisis from taking place again while some experts warn that the trump administration has rolled back or watered down some of these protective measures a number of protections still stand it is safe to assume that once the final numbers are tallied our current coronavirus fed recession will take the place of the great recession as the worst recession of all time there are several reasons for this including we ve seen greatest number of unemployment claims since the great depression it took only four weeks for covid 19 to wipe out the total number of jobs created since 2009 and to send the unemployment rate soaring there s still a lot of uncertainty we don t know when there will be a vaccine how many people will take advantage of it whether millions of small businesses will reopen or how long it will take for the majority of the unemployed to get back to work economic research may try to predict how long the current economic recession will linger and the central bank may try to stimulate the economy with changes to the federal funds rate nevertheless economic downturns are felt at ground level by everyday people it s tough to renew consumer confidence and return to normal pre recession spending levels the covid 19 recession while there are certainly lessons to be learned from previous recessions there s also a big and obvious difference none of those economic downturns were tied to a worldwide pandemic so what is a recession when it s tied to a once in a lifetime medical emergency one important thing to understand about recessions is that they are a normal part of the economic cycle the last major recession ended in 2009 and recovery began to take hold in mid 2011 according to the national bureau of economic research the average expansion period lasts around 59 months or just shy of five years this is why economists proclaimed we were overdue for a recession even before the novel coronavirus hit in other words we knew that the cyclical nature of business and economic growth would lead us into another recession what we had no way of knowing was that it would coincide with a once in a lifetime pandemic that unfortunate combination has led to economic declines of near historic proportions including unemployment more than 38 million americans filed jobless claims during the nine week period beginning march 12 that figure does not include many freelance and gig workers who were unable to register unemployment claims nor those whose income was reduced more than 38 million americans filed jobless claims during the nine week period beginning march 12 that figure does not include many freelance and gig workers who were unable to register unemployment claims nor those whose income was reduced stock market dow jones experienced a 2 997 point drop the largest in its 123 year old history on march 16 dow jones experienced a 2 997 point drop the largest in its 123 year old history on march 16 gdp on march 31 as businesses shuttered and millions of americans were sheltering in place economists from goldman sachs forecasted a 34 drop in gdp in the coming months on march 31 as businesses shuttered and millions of americans were sheltering in place economists from goldman sachs forecasted a 34 drop in gdp in the coming months consumer confidence the global consumer confidence index surveys more than 17 500 adults under the age of 75 in 24 countries the global consumer confidence index for june is 40 0 8 7 points lower than it was in january which is problematic consumer insecurity leads to less spending and slows the economy as a whole how a recession might affect you what is a recession it s a downturn in economic activity that impacts us all to some degree even if our jobs are secure it is likely that our retirement accounts will lose value and many of our homes will be worth less than they were prior to the recession as more people lose their jobs and unemployment grows the number of bankruptcies and foreclosures will go up meaning some of the homes around ours will stand empty one of the longest lasting impacts of a recession may be emotional a study published in clinical psychological science found that people who suffered a job related housing related or financial hardship during the last recession were more likely to show signs of depression anxiety and drug use years after the recession ended those without a safety net are particularly impacted do house prices drop during a recession the short answer is yes for most people home prices will drop during a recession in order to predict how much prices could dip the real estate company redfin researched changes in home values during the last recession they found average home values dropped 9 per year during the great recession with single family homes holding their value the best losing an average of 8 townhomes lost 9 3 value per year and condos lost 13 1 during the same time one reason for the drop in home values involves consumer anxiety the less secure buyers feel about their jobs the less likely they are to pay top dollar for a home how to prepare for a recession because we know there will be recessions in the future we have a chance to prepare that s a positive the following steps can help you weather an economic downturn build a budget if you don t already have one create a budget that takes your current situation into account if you don t already have one

know about unemployment lack of economic growth what happens to the gdp and how consumer spending is impacted be sure to tell them that a recession is one of those events in life that we know will occur and one that we can plan for there are things you can do to keep afloat and ride out the recession without losing too much ground they include
bernie sanders supporters are quick to make clear that their guy doesn t want to turn america into cuba or venezuela or the old soviet union by democratic socialism the us senator from vermont means scandinavia more or less and what s wrong with that the nordic nations are pretty nice even president trump has conceded that norway produces a quality immigrant but does sanders really want to import scandinavian socialism he brags that his universal health care plan eliminates patient cost sharing but scandinavia has it sanders wants to raise a lot of revenue through heavy taxes on business and investment scandinavia doesn t sanders has a big problem with billionaires scandinavia doesn t indeed as i have written the egalitarian nordic nations have as many billionaires relatively as the us and more concentrated wealth at least as measured by the share of wealth controlled by the top 10 percent i could go on and on mentioning how the nordics score highly in the conservative heritage foundation s economic freedom index especially when it comes to government regulation they re also free traders unlike sanders who opposed the north american free trade agreement in the 1990s and its successor agreement today as a jpmorgan analysis cautioned copy the nordic model if you like but understand that it entails a lot of capitalism and pro business policies a lot of taxation on middle class spending and wages minimal reliance on corporate taxation and plenty of co pays and deductibles in its healthcare system here s a tale of scandinavian socialism that team bernie never tells via a milken review institute piece from swedish economist andreas bergh in the 1970s several well intended political reforms backfired the desire to increase income equality through high marginal tax rates and generous welfare benefits weakened work incentives and created strong incentives for tax avoidance indeed in the 1970s and 1980s many wealthy swedes notably bjorn borg left the country to avoid the taxman meanwhile the desire to tame the business cycle and minimize unemployment led to the subsidization of noncompetitive industries the unions desire to drive wages ahead of productivity growth led to inflation while efforts to restore sweden s competitiveness through repeated currency devaluations led to both a lower living standard and investment sapping uncertainty perhaps most important the mix of subsidies and devaluations sent the signal that firms in trouble could turn to the government for help rather than be forced to innovate in order to stay competitive when that happens economies inevitably pay a price after the crisis of the early 1990s the swedish economy recovered smartly in many ways sweden learned from its mistakes and took measures to avoid large budget deficits and inflationary wage pressures by the mid 1990s these changes were institutionalized and strikingly often with support from social democrats as well as the right wing parties prominent examples include a tax reform that lowered marginal rates substantially and a pension reform that balanced the risks between pensioners and taxpayers by automatically adjusting payments to demographic and economic conditions whatever sanders wants to turn america into it doesn t sound much like scandinavia as it exists in current reality then again as that jpmorgan report concluded a real life proof of concept for a successful democratic socialist society like the lost city of atlantis has yet to be found published in
reserve bank governor adrian orr the reserve bank s rate cuts will make themselves felt this year photo file comment glum seems to be the state of business sentiment here and now at least that is what the latest nzier quarterly survey of business opinion qsbo would suggest but other indicators provide a more cheerful view the qsbo s measure of firms own trading activity found a net 11 per cent reporting a fall in the last three months of 2019 when the long run average for that indicator is a net 11 per cent recording an increase read more confidence up but profit squeeze points to tepid recovery in 2020 business confidence continues to improve but growth may still be sliding pattrick smellie five reasons new zealand will be a winner in the 2020s that implies an economy suffering from soft demand and would be consistent the institute tells us with annual gross domestic product growth of a scant 1 per cent but that particular indicator was just as weak in the september quarter when gdp actually rose 0 7 per cent making 2 3 per cent for the year the survey s domestic trading activity readings have proven weaker than gdp outcomes for about a year now even if historically they have been a pretty reliable indicator in any case looking forward indicators of household incomes and wealth important for firms chasing the consumer s dollar are looking better than they have done as is the international environment nor can the prospect of some loosening of the government s purse strings in this election year be ruled out the labour market is tight demand for labour has been growing fast enough to absorb an historically strong sustained increase in the labour force from net migration while the participation rate has remained above 70 per cent the prime age employment rate the share of people aged between 15 and 64 who are employed is 77 4 per cent a rate exceeded by only four of 36 oecd countries for at least the past year the qsbo has been showing a marked gap between firms employment intentions for the next three months and reported outcomes headcount changes over the past three months that gap indicates widespread and persistent difficulty finding the people employers need and the survey s measure of the ease of finding skilled labour in particular is deep in negative territory when about two thirds of the increase in the labour force is coming from the airport rather than out of nz schools and universities the immigration minister should be in the gun over the skills gap one consequence of a tight labour market is that we are seeing at last some decent wage growth in the year ended last september private sector ordinary time hourly earnings rose 3 9 per cent add in the public sector and overtime and the increase was 4 2 per cent up from 2 9 per cent in the september 2018 year and 2 2 per cent the year before that while this rate of wage inflation no doubt contributes to the squeeze on profitability the qsbo discerns rising household incomes are positive for consumer facing businesses top line one firm s employees are other firms customers meanwhile the lagged effects of last year s official cash rate cuts should be felt this year one of the main ways they will be felt is to push up house prices making the two thirds of households that are owner occupiers feel wealthier and more inclined to spend some of their increased equity whether lower interest rates will encourage business to invest more as the reserve bank hopes is more debatable the qsbo found a net 3 per cent of firms saying they expect to spend less on plant and machinery over the next 12 months than they did over the past 12 months but that caution is not related to the cost of borrowing and with interest rates at historic lows it would be odd if it was only 4 per cent of firms cite finance as the factor most limiting their ability to lift turnover it is worth noting however that the qsbo does not directly survey the agriculture sector if it did that 4 per cent would almost certainly be higher so let s assume businesses caution on investment reflects uncertainty driven by the news flow domestic and international new zealand is enjoying an exceptionally favourable mix of export and import prices photo file the latter ought to improve there is a truce at least in the trade war between the united states and china more broadly the oecd compiles composite leading indicators of economic momentum for its own members and the major emerging markets the latest set released this week show growth stabilising in most advanced economies and china albeit at a lower level than in the past new zealand meanwhile is enjoying an exceptionally favourable mix of export and import prices the terms of trade have been more favourable than this only once since the 1950s that was two years ago read more new zealand tops china s food import list overtaking the united states the anz commodity price index rose 12 9 per cent in new zealand dollar terms over the course of 2019 and fonterra is forecasting a payout of 7 a kilogram or better for the current season domestically a key source of uncertainty relates to fiscal policy the construction sector in particular will be keenly awaiting more details on the composition and timing of the increase in infrastructure spending the government foreshadowed last month and as far as its operating expenditure and the modest 900 million deficit now forecast for the current year are concerned it is worth noting that a week after the treasury closed off its forecasts for tax revenue statistics nz released national accounts which revised upward by just over 4 billion the level of nominal gdp a proxy for the tax base at the start of the current year so the forecast deficit might not eventuate and even if it does given how low government debt is by international standards and how cheaply it can borrow there is no fiscal excuse for may s budget failing to address the social deficit it inherited altogether it suggests a happier new year than the qsbo would imply

hours worked during the fy 2019 2019 was a pivotal year for the asanko gold mine as it transitioned from a significant capital investment phase to generating free cash flow in the latter part of the year said greg mccunn chief executive officer the processing plant continued to operate very well with record production from 5 5 million tonnes processed in 2019 resulting in the agm exceeding its production guidance for the year with 251 044 ounces produced based on preliminary estimates all in sustaining costs for the year are expected to be about 5 above the upper end of our guidance as costs in q4 were adversely impacted by the processing of lower grade stockpiles we expect to provide 2020 production and cost guidance in mid february along with the results of the agm updated life of

62mt of waste and 0 85mt of ore at an average gold grade of 1 9 g t were mined from the nkran pit the esaase pits collectively delivered 0 56mt of ore at an average gold grade of 1 3 g t with 2 34mt of waste mined in q4 an upper bench slippage in the western wall of the nkran pit resulted in a higher reliance on the processing of lower grade stockpiles than forecasted with slope stability radar monitoring the event was anticipated and the pit was vacated in advance of the slippage with no injuries or damage to equipment full mining operations resumed in the nkran pit three days after the slippage with a focus on clean up operations which resulted in lower grades being mined from the nkran pit adversely impacting aisc this quarter the slippage is not expected to materially affect 2020 production and its impact if any on the longer term mine plan will be included in the updated life of mine plan expected to be completed in q1 2020 the processing plant milled a record 1 46mt at a

preliminary aisc per ounce were 969 costs were higher than expected as a result of an upper bench slippage in the western wall of the nkran pit which resulted in a higher reliance on the processing of lower grade stockpiles during the quarter this led to lower than anticipated feed grade which translated to higher than expected production cost on a per ounce basis for fy 2019 preliminary operating

taos new mexico may 15 2019 money in a tip jar in a taos new mexico coffee shop includes a two dollar bill photo by robert alexander getty images getty images imagine inflation in your country was so fierce that the value of what you were paid this week was worth less then what you were paid last month imagine that all you have known over the past 39 years is inflation of more than 200 you live in a protectionist economy that limits free trade and is unstable imagine that you have some local cash for basic transactions like food but any real savings you hold in u s dollars maybe you barter for the things you need perhaps you stuff your money in the mattress or have a secret location because you don t trust the local banks you cannot hold your money abroad because the government controls how cash flows in and out of the country constant mismanagement and inefficiencies keep you from trusting anyone in the financial sector what is worse if you did save your money in your local bank new currency controls just prevented you from getting access to your money you talk to your friends your family your co workers and start to worry will my money be there in the morning this is not fiction this is not a drama written for a new dystopian series it is real this is argentina s current economy and it is similar to other countries like turkey and indonesia individuals in general do not have a choice of what currency they use they pay for goods and services in local fiat in countries like the u s or the u k low inflation and economic stability is a primary objective and managed by a competent banking infrastructure but in nations where economic instability is typical what are the options for people who don t want to be part of the local banking culture or do you stuff what you earn in the mattress cryptocurrency and stablecoins offer people in economies like argentina an alternative that can create positive political and economic change private enterprises could pay employees in bitcoin libra or other stablecoin types of course this is an oversimplification of the economic reality regulatory rules and compliance need to be adopted by central banks that support a decentralized digital asset addition to local economies while using bitcoin as a currency is not a reality yet people are still trading it as a commodity and a speculative store of value this store of value can help people in distressed economies as an alternative credit and cash loan conduit through crypto lenders but what are the risks to individuals who use these services are lenders who use bitcoin or any cryptocurrency providing a real service to consumers crypto lenders like blockfi unchained capital salt and celsius offer accounts similar to traditional margin lending accounts margin credit allows the borrower to leverage an asset in exchange for capital for example in a conventional stock brokerage account the broker lends the investor cash to buy stock the cash loan is collateralized by the existing assets and credit of the investor a margin account can help individuals increase profits or magnify losses based on the performance of the underlying asset the underlying stock price change creates a risk in the case of crypto lenders by depositing bitcoin or an accepted stablecoin you can borrow dollars if crypto lender is licensed to provide capital in a distressed economy like argentina individuals can use there cryptocurrency for consumer loans however as in stock brokerage price volatility is also a risk in crypto margin loans i interviewed two crypto lenders who are working in this space blockfi and unchained capital both are lenders but have different business models blockfi founded in august 2017 is a crypto financial services company whose model is to become a lender in financial products traditionally reserved for currencies like the u s dollar or the euro the company services customers worldwide including 48 u s states and accepts a variety of coins including the stablecoin usdc blockfi lends in argentina flori marquez is a co founder and the vice president of operations for blockfi based in new york city flori is originally from argentina she started in the banking business but believed in cryptocurrencies potential to change how people access money during our interview she told me stories of how people used different rates to convert local cash to u s dollars i asked her how she envisioned blockfi s competitive advantage versus local backs in troubled economies she said we are able to conduct international transactions without using a bank or an established industry incumbent like western union this newfound capability signifies something greater that we can offer financial products to citizens in both underbanked or unbanked countries and we can do it instantly she continued the second added benefit crypto brings the ability to do away with credit scores in the us we take for granted our ability to access secure financial products this right is not available to citizens of other countries who do not have a credit score in latin american countries like argentina the consumer credit industry is fractured and can charge high interest rates with few banks consumers have few choices for loans and access to credit credit scores and credit utilization is measured differently in many countries compared to countries like the united states instead of specialized groups like equifax experian and transunion consumers in many counties rely on their local bank for credit score metrics and often only negative information is kept in other words only information on bad credit is retained rather than a complete picture across other financial indicators this is significant to the consumer because small business loans or mortgages may be viewed as risky and credit is refused the individual may then look for looser credit lenders who can be predatory i asked ms marquez how she felt access to crypto was different she said for example if you re a spanish citizen and you live in the country santander may be your bank of choice and since they are your main provider of financial services they are the ones that can create and track your credit score as a result u s companies are prohibited from being able to offer financial products in these countries but crypto bypasses this infrastructure this is not a solution to offering citizens in different countries an entirely new economy such as a bitcoin economy but it does represent a new choice access to us grade credit is essential for people who are looking for stability especially in troubled and emerging economies with high inflation but the financial limitation and controls aren t limited to traditional banks there is the possibility that regardless of the asset a government or some monetary authority could take or freeze assets in the cases of fraud and theft this would be welcome and appropriate as a control but could that happen to the average investor could the government take your money because they need it in the case of argentina a rapidly changing situation as of december 17th the new government led by president alberto fernandez announced a new plan which would include among sovereign debt restructuring and other controls export tariffs and an increase on u s dollar purchases fees to 30 the increased taxes would also apply to foreign transactions but what about in stable countries like the u s it is rare but an example does exist in the united states when gold was confiscated in 1933 under executive order 6102 president franklin d roosevelt signed the order to prevent the hoarding of gold the government set the price and forced the sale to consumers however in context the great depression was an extraordinary event where the money supply could not be increased without the federal reserve having access to gold furthermore gold hoarding during the great depression was a problem for other countries england is another example without acquiring more gold central banks ability to change the money supply was limited after world war two the major economies would agree to leave the gold standard officially the events of the bretton woods agreement in 1944 and the subsequent currency agreements through the 1970s helped create the stable economies we know today in my research for this article i found that most economists would agree that leaving the gold standard was one reason economies grew out of the depression president gerald ford repealed the order in 1974 in the present u s economy which is not on a gold standard it seems unlikely that this type of confiscation would occur again it is curious to think about bitcoin s model of limited supply given the same context if the world was trading in a purely crypto environment would hoarding create a similar need if economies were in distress the allure for some bitcoin enthusiasts is the independence from monetary control however economies with reliable central banks like the u s and the u k can employ monetary controls to help fight inflation would hoarding bitcoin potentially cause a future depression because its supply is limited unchained capital another crypto margin provider who states they have facilitated over 100 million in aggregate bitcoin transaction volume for loans and custody to mostly u s based investors promotes collaborative custody where unchained capital holds part of the key needed for transactions this is a form of native crypto custody which helps prevent theft how crypto traders secure their assets and perform back office operations are potentially different in method there are no crypto standards i spoke briefly with phil geiger and will cole unchained capital s director of product marketing and chief product officer respectively over the phone the two are based in texas and provided information about their company s operation for this article mr geiger and mr cole are passionate believers that bitcoin investors should hold their keys at least in part to prevent theft but also to ensure clients have control over their assets for example if a financial or governmental authority approaches unchained capital for access to their client s bitcoin unchained capital cannot facilitate transactions because they hold only part of a key bitcoin regulation is an evolving arena how future regulations treat custody and ownership is an unfinished story the idea that the unbanked or any individual can utilize their crypto assets as collateral in a margin style loan in another example where new financial avenues are being created individuals conceivably can access different stablecoins and can elect to participate in other systems rather than be forced to use local fiat in troubled economies this can be a solution for the unbanked people of the world this could be their first exposure to a modern financial system but the question of risk theft and investor protection both from draconian economies and from predatory creditors are significant concerns yet to be understood
