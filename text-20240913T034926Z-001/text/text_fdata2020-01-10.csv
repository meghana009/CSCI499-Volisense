outlook for gold the gold price from 2020 onward will change drastically this article is an overview of the economic conditions that will drive the gold price in 2020 and beyond the turn of the credit cycle the effect on government deficits and how they are to be financed are addressed in the absence of foreign demand for new us treasuries and of a rise in the savings rate the us budget deficit can only be financed by monetary inflation this is bound to lead to higher bond yields as the dollar s falling purchasing power accelerates due to the sheer quantity of new dollars entering circulation the relationship between rising bond yields and the gold price is also discussed it may turn out that the recent extraordinary events on comex with the expansion of open interest failing to suppress the gold price are an early recognition in some quarters of the us government s debt trap the strains leading to a crisis for fiat currencies are emerging into plain sight introduction in 2019 priced in dollars gold rose 18 3 and silver by 15 1 or rather and this is the more relevant way of putting it priced in gold the dollar fell 15 5 and in silver 13 this is because the story of 2019 as it will be in 2020 was of the re emergence of fiat currency debasement particularly in the last quarter the fed began aggressively injecting new money into a surprisingly illiquid banking system through repurchase agreements whereby banks reserves at the fed are credited with cash loaned in return for t bills and coupon bearing treasuries as collateral furthermore the ecb restarted quantitative easing in november and the bank of japan stands ready to ease policy further if the momentum towards its 2 inflation target comes under threat kuroda 26 december the bank of japan is still buying bonds but at a pace which is expected to fall beneath redemptions of its existing holdings therefore we enter 2020 with money supply being expanded by two possibly all three of the major western central banks besides liquidity problems the central bankers nightmare is the threat that the global economy will slide into recession though no one will confess it openly because it would be an admission of policy failure and policy makers are also terrified that if bankers get wind of a declining economy they will withdraw loan facilities from businesses and make things much worse of the latter concern central banks have good cause a combination of the turn of the credit cycle towards its regular crisis phase and trump s tariff war has already hit international trade badly with exporting economies such as germany already in recession and important trade indicators such as the baltic dry index collapsing no doubt president trump s most recent announcement that a trade deal with china is ready for signing is driven by an understanding in some quarters of the white house that over trade policy trump is turning out to be the turkey who voted for christmas but we have heard this story several times before a forthcoming agreement announced only to be scrapped or suspended at the last moment the subject which will begin to dominate monetary policy in 2020 is who will fund escalating government deficits at the moment it is on few investors radar but it is bound to dawn on markets that a growing budget deficit in america will be financed almost entirely by monetary inflation a funding policy equally adopted in other jurisdictions furthermore christine lagarde the new ecb president has stated her desire for the ecb s quantitative easing to be extended from government financing to financing environmental projects as well 2020 is shaping up to be the year that all pretence of respect for money s role as a store of value is abandoned in favour of using it as a means of government funding without raising taxes 2020 will then be the year when currencies begin to be visibly trashed in the hands of their long suffering users gold in the context of distorted markets at the core of current market distortions is a combination of interest rate suppression and banking regulation it is unnecessary to belabour the point about interest rates because minimal and even negative rates have demonstrably failed to stimulate anything other than asset prices into bubble territory but there is a woeful lack of appreciation about the general direction of monetary policy and where it is headed the stated intention is the opposite of reality which is not to rescue the economy while important from a bureaucrat s point of view that is not the greatest priority it is to ensure that governments are never short of funds inflationary financing guarantees the government will always be able to spend and government licenced banks exist to ensure the government always has access to credit unbeknown to the public the government licences the banks to conduct their business in a way which for an unlicensed organisation is legally fraudulent the banks create credit or through their participation in qe they facilitate the creation of base money out of thin air which is added to their reserves it transfers wealth from unsuspecting members of the public to the government crony capitalists financial speculators and consumers living beyond their means the government conspires with its macroeconomists to supress the evidence of rising prices by manipulating the inflation statistics so successful has this scheme of deception been that by fuelling gdp monetary debasement is presented as economic growth with very few in financial mainstream understanding the deceit the government monopoly of issuing money and through their regulators controlling the expansion of credit was bound to lead to progressively greater abuse of monetary trust and now in this last credit cycle the consumer who is also the producer has had his income and savings so depleted by continuing monetary debasement that he can no longer generate the taxes to balance his government s books later in the credit cycle the problem is not new america has not had a budget surplus since 2001 the last credit cycle in the run up to the lehman crisis did not deliver a budget surplus nor has the current cycle instead following the lehman crisis we saw a marked acceleration of monetary inflation and figure 2 shows how dollar fiat money has expanded above its long term trend since then in recent years the fed s attempt to return to monetary normality by reducing its balance sheet has failed miserably after a brief pause the fiat money quantity has begun to grow at a pace not seen since the immediate aftermath of the lehman crisis itself and is back in record territory figure 1 is updated to 1 november since when fmq will have increased even more in order to communicate effectively the background for the relationship between gold and fiat currencies in 2020 it is necessary to put the situation as plainly as possible we enter the new decade with the highest levels of monetary ignorance imaginable it is a systemic issue of not realising the emperor has no clothes consequently markets have probably become more distorted than we have ever seen in the recorded history of money and credit as widespread negative interest rates and negative yielding bonds attest in our attempt to divine the future it leaves us with two problems assessing when the tension between wishful thinking in financial markets and market reality will crash the system and the degree of chaos that will ensue the timing is impossible to predict with certainty because we cannot know the future but if the characteristics of past credit cycles are a guide it will be marked with a financial and systemic crisis in one or more large banks liquidity strains suggest that event is close even within months and possibly weeks if so banks will be bailed of that we can be certain it will require central banks to create yet more money additional to that required to finance escalating government budget deficits monetary chaos promises to be greater than anything seen heretofore and it will engulf all western welfare dependent economies and those that trade with them we have established that between keeping governments financed bailing out banks and perhaps investing in renewable green energy the issuance of new money in 2020 will in all probability be unprecedented greater than anything seen so far it will lead to a feature of the crisis which may have already started and that is an increase in borrowing costs forced by markets onto central banks and their governments the yield on 10 year us treasuries is already on the rise as shown in figure 3 assuming no significant increase in the rate of savings and despite all attempts to suppress the evidence the acceleration in the rate of monetary inflation will eventually lead to runaway increases in the general level of prices measured in dollars as milton friedman put it inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon through qe central banks believe they can contain the cost of government funding by setting rates what they do not seem to realise is that while to a borrower interest is a cost to set against income to a lender it reflects time preference which is the difference between current possession in this case of cash dollars and possession at a future date unless and until the fed realises and addresses the time preference problem the dollar will lose purchasing power not only will it be sold in the foreign exchanges but depositors will move to minimise their balances and creditors their ownership of debt if as it appears in figure 3 dollar bond yields are beginning a rising trend the inexorable pull of time preference is already beginning to apply and further rises in bond yields will imperil government financing the congressional budget office assumes the average interest rate on debt held by the public will be 2 5 for the next three years and that net interest in fiscal 2020 will be 390bn being about 38 of the projected deficit of 1 008bn combining the additional consequences for government finances of a recession with higher bond yields than the cbo expects will be disastrous clearly in these circumstances the fed will do everything in its power to stop markets setting the cost of government borrowing but we have been here before the similarities between the situation for the dollar today and the deterioration of british government finances in the early to mid 1970s are remarkable they resulted in multiple funding crises and an eventual bail out from the imf except today there can be no imf bail out for the us and the dollar because the bailor gets its currency from the bailee nearly fifty years ago in the uk gold rose from under 15 per ounce in 1970 to 80 in december 1974 the peak of the credit cycle was at the end of 1971 when the 10 year gilt yield to maturity was 7 by december 1974 the stock market had crashed a banking crisis had followed price inflation was well into double figures and the 10 year gilt yield to maturity had risen to over 16 history rhymes as they say but for historians the parallels between the outlook for the dollar and us treasury funding costs at the beginning of 2020 and what transpired for the british economy following the barbour boom of 1970 71 are too close to ignore it is the same background for the relationship between gold and fiat currencies for 2020 and the few years that follow gold and rising interest rates received investment wisdom is that rising interest rates are bad for the gold price because gold has no yield yet experience repeatedly contradicts it anyone who remembers investing in uk gilts at a 7 yield in december 1971 only to see prices collapse to a yield of over 16 while gold rose from under 15 to 80 to the ounce over the three years following should attest otherwise part of the error is to believe that gold has no yield this is only true of gold held as cash and for non monetary usage as money it is loaned and borrowed just like any other form of money monetary gold has its own time preference as do government currencies in the absence of state intervention time preferences for gold and government currencies are set by their respective users bearing in mind the characteristics special to each it is not a subject for simple arbitrage selling gold and buying government money to gain the interest differential because the spread reflects important differences which cannot be ignored it is like shorting swiss francs and buying dollars in the belief there is no currency risk the principal variable between the time preferences of gold and a government currency is the difference between an established form of money derived from the collective preferences of its users for which there is no issuer risk and state issued currency which becomes an instrument of funding by means of its debasement the time preference of gold will obviously vary depending on lending risk which is in addition to an originary rate but it is considerably more stable than the time preference of a fiat currency gold s interest rate stability is illustrated in figure 4 which covers the period of the gold standard from the bank charter act of 1844 to before the first world war during which time the gold standard was properly implemented with the exception of uncontrolled bank credit sterling operated as a gold substitute admittedly due to problems created by the cycle of bank credit these year end values conceal some significant fluctuations such as at the time of the overend gurney collapse in 1866 when borrowing rates spiked to 10 the depression following the barings crisis of 1890 stalled credit demand which is evident from the chart however wholesale borrowing rates which were effectively the cost of borrowing in gold were otherwise remarkably stable varying between 2 3½ some of this variation can be ascribed to changing perceptions of general borrower risk and some to changes in industrial investment demand related to the cycle of bank credit compare this with dollar interest rates since 1971 when the dollar had suspended the remaining fig leaf of gold backing which is shown in figure 5 for the decade following in february 1972 the fed funds rate was 3 29 rising eventually to over 19 in january 1981 at the same time gold rose from 46 to a high of 843 at the morning fix on 21 january 1980 taking gold s originary interest rate as approximately 2 it required a 17 interest rate penalty to dissuade people from hoarding gold and to hold onto dollars instead in 1971 us government debt stood at 35 of gdp and in 1981 it stood at 31 the us government ran a budget surplus over the decade sufficient to absorb the rising interest cost on its t bill obligations and any new treasury funding america enters 2020 with a debt to gdp ratio of over 100 higher interest rates are therefore not a policy option and the us government and the dollar are ensnared in a debt trap from which the dollar is unlikely to recover the seeds of the dollar s destruction were sown over fifty years ago when the london gold pool was formed whereby central banks committed to help the us maintain the price at 35 being forced to do so because the us could no longer supress the gold price on its own and with good reason figure 6 shows how the last fifty years have eroded the purchasing power of the four major currencies since the gold pool failed over the last fifty years the yen has lost over 92 the dollar 97 6 the euro and its earlier components 98 2 and sterling the most at 98 7 and now we are about to embark on the greatest increase of global monetary inflation ever seen the market for physical gold in recent years demand for physical gold has been strong chinese and indian private sector buyers have to date respectively accumulated an estimated 17 000 tonnes based on deliveries from shanghai gold exchange vaults and about 24 000 tonnes according to wgc director somasundaram pr quoted in india s financial express last may it is generally thought that higher prices for gold will deter future demand from these sources with the vast bulk of it being categorised as simply jewellery but this is a western view based on a belief in objective values for government currencies and subjective prices for gold it ignores the fact that for asians it is gold that has the objective value in asia gold jewellery is acquired as a store of value to avoid the depreciation of government currency hoarded as a central component of a family s long term wealth accumulation therefore there is no certainty higher prices will compromise asian demand indeed demand has not been undermined in india with the price rising from r300 to the ounce to over r100 000 today since the london gold pool failed and that s despite all the government disincentives and even bans from buying gold additionally since 2008 central banks have accumulated over 4 400 tonnes to increase their official reserves to 34 500 tonnes the central banks most active in the gold market are asian and increasingly the east and central europeans there are two threads to this development first there is a geopolitical element with russia replacing reserve dollars for gold and china having deliberately moved to control global physical delivery markets and second there is evidence of concern amongst the europeans that the dollar s role as the reserve currency is either being compromised or no longer fit for a changed world furthermore the rising power of asia s two hegemons continues to drive over two thirds of the world s population away from the dollar towards gold goldmoney estimates there are roughly 180 000 tonnes of gold above ground much of which cannot be categorised as monetary monetary not as defined for the purposes of customs reporting but in the wider sense to include all bars coins and pure gold jewellery accumulated for its long term wealth benefits through good and bad times annual mine production adds 3 000 3 500 tonnes giving a stock to flow ratio of over 50 times put another way the annual increase in the gold quantity is similar to the growth in the world s population imparting great stability as a medium of exchange these qualities stand in contrast to the increasingly certain acceleration of fiat currency debasement over the next few years anyone prepared to stand back from the financial coalface can easily see where the relationship between gold and fiat currencies is going most of the world s population is moving away from the established fiat regime towards gold as a store of value their own fiat currencies lacking sufficient credibility to act as a dollar alternative and financial markets immersed in the fiat regime have very little physical gold in possession instead where it is now perceived that there is a risk of missing out on a rise in the gold price investors have begun accumulating in greater quantities the paper alternatives to physical gold etfs futures options forward contracts and mining shares paper markets from the us government s point of view gold as a rival to the dollar must be quashed and the primary purpose of futures options and forwards is to expand artificial supply to keep the price from rising in a wider context the ability to print synthetic commodities out of thin air is a means of suppressing prices generally and we must not be distracted by claims that derivatives improve liquidity they only improve liquidity at lower prices when the dollar price of gold found a major turning point on 17 december 2015 open interest on comex stood at 393 000 contacts the year end figure today is nearly double that at 786 422 contracts representing an increase of paper supply equivalent to 1 224 tonnes but that is not all not only are there other regulated derivative exchanges with gold contracts but also there are unregulated over the counter markets according to the bank for international settlements from end 2015 unregulated otc contracts principally london forward contracts expanded by the equivalent of 2 450 tonnes by last june taken at contemporary prices and we must not forget the unknown quantity of bank liabilities to customers unallocated accounts which probably involve an additional few thousand tonnes in recent months the paper suppression regime has stepped up a gear evidenced by comex s open interest rising this is illustrated in figure 7 there are two notable features in the chart first the rising gold price has seen increasing paper supply which we would expect from a market designed to keep a lid on prices secondly instead of declining with the gold price open interest continued to rise following the price peak in early september while the gold price declined by about 100 this tells us that the price suppression scheme has run into trouble with large buyers taking the opportunity to increase their positions at lower prices in the past bullion banks have been able to put a lid on prices by creating comex contracts out of thin air the recent expansion of open interest has failed to achieve this objective and it is worth noting that the quantity of gold in comex vaults eligible for delivery and pledged is only 2 of the 2 446 tonne short position in london there are only 3 052 tonnes in lbma vaults excluding the bank of england which includes an unknown quantity of etf and custodial gold physical liquidity for the forward market in london is therefore likely to be very small relative to forward deliveries and of course the bullion banks in london and elsewhare do not have the metal to cover their obligations to unallocated account holders which is an additional consideration clearly there is not the gold available in the system to legitimise derivative paper it now appears that paper gold markets could be drifting into systemic difficulties with bullion banks squeezed by a rising gold price short positions and unallocated accounts there are mechanisms to counter these systemic risks such as the ability to declare force majeure on comex and standard unallocated account contracts which permit a bullion bank to deliver cash equivalents to bullion obligations but the triggering of any such escape from physical gold obligations could exacerbate a buying panic driving prices even higher it leads to the conclusion that any rescue of the bullion market system is destined to fail a two step future for the gold price it has been evident for some time that the world of fiat currencies has been drifting into ever greater difficulties of far greater magnitude than can be contained by spinning a few thousand tonnes of gold back and forth on comex and in london that appears to be the lesson to be drawn from the inability of a massive increase in open interest on comex to contain a rising gold price it will take a substantial upward shift in the gold price to appraise western financial markets of this reality in combination with systemic strains increasing a gold price of over 2 000 may do the trick professional investors will have found themselves wrongfooted underinvested in etfs gold mines and regulated derivatives in which case their gold demand is likely to drive one or more bullion houses into considerable difficulties we might call this the first step in a two step monetary future the extent to which gold prices rise could be substantial but assuming the immediate crisis itself passes banks having been bailed in or out and qe accelerated in an attempt to put a lid on government bond yields then the gold price might be deemed to have risen too far and due for a correction but then there will be the prospect of an accelerating loss of purchasing power for fiat currencies as a result of the monetary inflation and that will drive the second step as investors realise that what they are seeing is not a rising gold price but a fiat currency collapse the high levels of government debt today in the three major jurisdictions appear to almost guarantee this outcome the amounts involved are so large that today s paper gold suppression scheme is likely to be too small in comparison and cannot stop it happening the effect on currency purchasing powers will then be beyond question monetary authorities will be clueless in their response because they have all bought into a form of economics that puts what will happen beyond their understanding as noted above the path to a final crisis for fiat currencies might have already started with the failure by the establishment to suppress the gold price through the creation of an extra 100 000 comex contracts if not then any success by the monetary authorities to reassert control is likely to be temporary perhaps we are already beginning to see the fiat currency system beginning to unravel in which case those that insist gold is not money will find themselves impoverished alasdair macleod please check back for new articles and updates at commoditytrademantra com
overview the first full week of 2020 is ending on a quiet note pending the often volatile us jobs report new record high us equities on the back of easing geopolitical anxiety is a reflection of greater risk appetite that is evident across the capital markets asia pacific equities mostly rose today though chinese shares and a few of the smaller markets saw small losses the msci asia pacific index rose about 0 2 on the week the sixth consecutive weekly advance european equities are up small for the fourth straight session it is also the fourth weekly gain in the past five weeks and is sitting at new record highs us shares are firm and the dow jones industrials are knocking on the 29000 level since the start of q4 19 the s p 500 has fallen in just three weeks benchmark 10 year yields are softer in europe with italy s six basis point decline leading the way the us 10 year is little changed on the day near 1 85 holding on to around a five basis point increase on the week this week s nine basis point rise in the german 10 year yield was the largest rise among the major bond markets the dollar remains firm against nearly all the major currencies although the australian dollar is showing some resiliency today the greenback is having its best week in about two months the jp morgan emerging market currency index is a little heavier for the second consecutive session but on the week it is up by about 0 25 and is the fifth week in the past six that it has appreciated gold continues to unwind its recent gains after reaching a high near 1611 on the middle east developments it is trading below 1550 and is snapping a four week rally oil too is paring its gains and is lower for the fourth consecutive session february wti hit 65 65 before reversing lower it fell to nearly 58 65 yesterday and is consolidating above 59 today asia pacific japanese household spending fell 2 year over year in november this was a little more than expected but showed what is likely to be a gradual recovery from the sales increase shock spending had collapsed by 5 1 in october the government efforts to boost spending do appear to have mitigated the slump compared with the last time the sales tax was hiked 2014 nevertheless the japanese economy seems to have contracted sharply in q4 20 and the latest bloomberg survey showed a median forecast of a 3 7 decline in overall output last month the survey had a median forecast of a 2 6 contraction australian retail sales in november rose by 0 9 twice what economists had expected and the october series was revised to 0 1 from flat the november increase was the strongest in two years the risk is that the black friday sales brought forward the holiday purchases leaving december vulnerable to disappointment separately the aig services index fell to 48 7 from 53 7 the weakest since july the market leans slightly toward a 25 bp cut when the reserve bank of australia meets next on february 4 the dollar has jumped from a nearly three month low against the yen in the middle of the week jpy107 65 to test jpy109 65 in the european morning so far today it has been stuck in less than a 20 tick range there are options for about 800 mln struck in the jpy109 40 jpy109 50 area that expire today and one at jpy110 20 for 1 2 bln the dollar has not been above jpy110 since last may since the middle of the week the australian dollar has found a base near 0 6850 but it is showing little enthusiasm to the upside the 200 day moving average is a little below 0 6900 and a close above it would lift the tone the chinese yuan is trading firmer and is near a five month high with the dollar just above cny6 92 lastly we note that the indonesian rupiah is leading asian and emerging market currencies today with around a 0 6 gain 1 15 on the week following comments by the central bank that seemed to signal acceptance of a stronger currency europe following the better than expected german industrial production data yesterday france italy and spain reported relatively good figures today supporting ideas that the troubled sector is stabilizing french industrial output rose 0 3 a little more than expected manufacturing output slipped by 0 1 but the october series was revised to 0 6 from 0 5 italian industrial production rose 0 1 which was not only better than expected but was the first increase since august spain s industrial output jumped by 1 the most since april economists had forecast a 0 2 rise taken together it appears to be upside risk to next week s aggregate report where a 0 5 gain had been expected the brexit bills passed the house of commons yesterday and the house of lords will take the measures up next however this is largely a formality meanwhile the bank of england may be closer to cutting rates that the two dissents at the past two meetings would suggest governor carney hinted as much yesterday and mpc member tenreyro suggested that she could be persuaded to cut rates if the economic data does not improve this is slightly different than favoring a cut if conditions deteriorate the euro peaked near 1 1240 on new year s eve and is testing the 1 1090 area today in europe the 61 8 retracement of the rally since last november s 1 0980 low is found near 1 1080 today the technical condition is deteriorating and a break of the shelf created in the second half of december near 1 1065 could see the single currency test 1 10 next week the 1 1100 area that was support may now act as resistance helped by an option for almost 840 mln euros the sterling is consolidating within yesterday s range and remains above 1 30 there is an option for nearly gbp600 mln at 1 3065 that expires today america the us and canadian employment reports dominate the north american session although the bloomberg survey shows a median forecast of 160k increase in us nonfarm payrolls after the 266k increase in november the whisper number is higher closer to 200k on the back of the strength of the service sector market psychology is such that there may be an asymmetrical risk the market is more likely to shrug off a soft report this sense has been reinforced by the numerous fed comments that suggest that officials will look past a disappointing report canada s real sector data has disappointed recently and the streak may have begun with the november employment data that saw a heady 71 2k loss of jobs which included nearly 38 5k full time positions economists look for a bounce of about 25k jobs but another loss of jobs would likely bring back talk of a rate cut the bank of canada meets on january 22 and there is practically no chance of a move then however as it did in q4 it may soften its neutrality but in addition to a soft employment report weaker price pressures may be needed to stir the market mexico reports november industrial output it is expected to rise by 0 9 which would snap a two month contract such a rise would be the largest since january easing price pressures and the weak economy has the market expecting a rate cut when the central bank meets again near the middle of next month brazil reports its ipca inflation and unlike mexico price pressure appears to have bottomed and this leaves the central bank little choice but to stand pat as the selic rate is at a record low of 4 50 the december ipca measure may put the cpi at near 4 25 leaving real rates just above zero which does not appear sufficient to support the currency the us dollar spiked above cad1 3100 yesterday after bottoming near cad1 2950 earlier in the week initial support now is seen near cad1 3050 above cad1 3100 the next technical target is near cad1 3140 and then cad1 3180 meanwhile the mexican peso remains firm the peso is one of the strongest emerging market currencies this week gaining a little more than 0 5 against the dollar it appears to be the fifth week in the past six that the greenback has weakened against the peso the high real and nominal yields attract savings and carry trades original post editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors

although the bloomberg survey shows a median forecast of 160k increase in us nonfarm payrolls after the 266k increase in november the whisper number is higher closer to 200k on the back of the strength of the service sector market psychology is such that there may be an asymmetrical risk the market is more likely to shrug off a soft report this sense has been reinforced by the numerous fed comments that suggest that officials will look past a disappointing report canada s real sector data has disappointed recently and the streak may have begun with the november employment data that saw a heady 71 2k loss of jobs which included nearly 38 5k full time positions economists look for a bounce of about 25k jobs but another loss of jobs would likely bring back talk of a rate cut the bank of canada meets on january 22 and there is practically no chance of move then however as it did in q4 it may soften its neutrality but in addition to a soft employment report weaker price pressures may be needed to stir the market mexico reports november industrial output it is expected to rise by 0 9 which would snap a two month contract such a rise would be the largest since january easing price pressures and the weak economy has the market expecting a rate cut when the central bank meets again near the middle of next month brazil reports its ipca inflation and unlike mexico price pressure appears to have bottomed and this leaves the central bank little choice but to stand pat as the selic rate is at a record low of 4 50 the december ipca measure may put the cpi at near 4 25

keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite a deepening downturn in a manufacturing sector stung by trade disputes the labour department s closely watched monthly employment report on friday also showed the jobless rate holding near a 50 year low of 3 5 per cent a broader measure of unemployment dropped to a record low last month but wage gains ebbed the mixed report will probably not change the federal reserve s assessment that both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place meanwhile the us dollar rose two week highs on friday on track for its biggest weekly gain in two months helped by easing geopolitical tension between the us and iran with investors shrugging off a weaker than expected us non farm payrolls report for december against a basket of currencies the dollar gained 0 1 per cent on friday to 97 50 taking its cumulative gains this week to 0 7 per cent on track for its biggest weekly rise since early november during the session the

per cent versus the swiss franc at 0 9748 the yen s and swiss franc s losses reflected fading worries about an imminent us iran conflict the galvanising force for the dollar rally this week was the fizzling of tensions in the middle east with the recent us data also giving investors some further room for optimism said ricardo evangelista a senior analyst at activtrades the euro was also down 0 1 per cent against the dollar at 1 1100 the wall street stocks were flat early on friday following a mixed us jobs report amid continued optimism on us china trade relations rubeela farooqi chief us economist at high frequency economics said the report was supportive of an on hold fed stance though we would have to see coming months readings to see if the slowdown in payrolls is more persistent the dow jones industrial average stood 28 942 51 down 0 1 per cent the broad based s p 500 was up a hair at 3 275 56 while the tech rich nasdaq composite index was essentially unchanged at 9 204 17 all three indices finished at records on thursday amid relief that a us iran conflict did not appear to be escalating and that trade deal with china is slated to be signed later this month there is nothing here that changes the picture of an economy that is continuing to expand at a pace that exceeds its potential growth rate said conrad dequadros senior economic advisor at brean capital in new york the fed should be very comfortable with this report non farm payrolls increased by 145 000 jobs last month with manufacturing shedding jobs after being boosted in november by the return to work of about 46 000 production workers at general motors after a strike the government s survey of establishments showed but milder than normal temperatures in december boosted hiring at construction sites and employment at retailers surged last month some of the slowdown in overall job growth in december is likely due to seasonal volatility associated with a later than normal thanksgiving day economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 164 000 jobs in december roughly 100 000 jobs per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working age population data for october and november was revised to show 14 000 fewer jobs added than previously reported the economy created 2 1 million jobs in 2019 down from 2 7 million in 2018 reports on housing trade and consumer

treasury prices rose us stock index futures pared gains tight labour market the labour market has continued to churn out jobs at a healthy clip despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages which economists had feared would significantly restrain hiring there are however concerns the labor department s bureau of labor statistics bls which compiles the employment data may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of president donald trump s 18 month long trade war with china which has pushed manufacturing into recession and led to company closures the government last august estimated that the economy created 501 000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through march 2019 than previously reported the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade that suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170 000 per month instead of 210 000 the revised payrolls data will be published next month the projected massive revision has attracted the attention of some fed officials minutes of the us central bank s dec 10 11 policy meeting published last week showed a couple of officials viewed the anticipated downgrade as an indication that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year economists say downward revisions of that magnitude suggest that the model the government uses to calculate the net number of jobs from new business and closings is faulty some expect payrolls growth beyond last march could also be revised down reuters afp

japanese household spending fell 2 year over year in november this was a little more than expected but showed what is likely to be a gradual recovery from the sales increase shock spending had collapsed by 5 1 in october the government efforts to boost spending do appear to have mitigated the slump compared with the last time the sales tax was hiked 2014 nevertheless the japanese economy seems to have contracted sharply in q4 20 and the latest bloomberg survey showed a median forecast of a 3 7 decline in overall output last month the survey had a median forecast of a 2 6 contraction australian retail sales in november rose by 0 9 twice what economists had expected and the october series was revised to 0 1 from flat the november increase was the strongest in two years the risk is

if conditions deteriorate the peaked near 1 1240 on new year s eve and is testing the 1 1090 area today in europe the 61 8 retracement of the rally since last november s 1 0980 low is found near 1 1080 today the technical condition is deteriorating and a break of the shelf created in the second half of december near 1 1065 could see the single currency test 1 10 next week the 1 1100 area that was support may now act as resistance helped by an option for almost 840 mln euros is consolidating within yesterday s range and remains above 1 30 there is an option for nearly gbp600 mln at 1 3065 that expires today america the u s and canadian employment reports dominate the north american session although the bloomberg survey shows a median forecast of 160k increase in u s nonfarm payrolls after the 266k increase in november the whisper number is higher closer to 200k on the back of the strength of the service sector market psychology is such that there may be an asymmetrical risk the market is more likely to shrug off a soft report this sense has been reinforced by the numerous fed comments that suggest that officials will look past a disappointing report canada s real sector data has disappointed recently and the streak may have begun with the november employment data that saw a heady 71 2k loss of jobs which included nearly 38 5k full time positions economists look for a bounce of about 25k jobs but another loss of jobs would likely bring back talk of a rate cut the bank of canada meets on january 22 and there is practically no chance of move then however as it did in q4 it may soften its neutrality but in addition to a soft employment report weaker price pressures may be needed to stir the market mexico reports november industrial output it is expected to rise by 0 9 which would snap a two month contract such a rise would be the largest since january easing price pressures and the weak economy has the market expecting a rate cut when the central bank meets again near the middle of next month brazil reports its ipca inflation and unlike mexico price pressure appears to have bottomed and this leaves the central bank little choice but to stand pat as the selic rate is at a record low of 4 50 the december ipca measure may put the cpi at near 4 25 leaving real rates just above zero which does not appear sufficient to support the currency the u s dollar spiked above cad1 3100 yesterday after bottoming near cad1 2950 earlier in the week initial support now is seen near cad1 3050 above cad1 3100 the next technical target is near cad1 3140 and then cad1 3180 meanwhile the mexican peso remains firm the peso is one of the strongest emerging market currencies this week gaining a little more than 0 5 against the dollar it appears to be the fifth week in the past six that the greenback has weakened against the peso the high real and nominal yields attract savings and carry trades

during the years that former president obama was in office i heard a constant string of warnings about the pending financial doom we were facing the combination of soaring national debt overregulation of business and industry and the heavier tax burden being placed on the public was surely driving the nation to the brink of financial disaster or so the narrative went but what has changed since then granted president trump has a much better understanding of business than obama ever did but many of the same factors which existed during obama s years in office still exist today the national debt is still growing with a 5 budget deficit trump s efforts to reduce the budget have been blocked at every turn rather than the federal government shrinking during his tenure in office it seems to still be growing related 10 things to do on the day the economy collapses leading economic indicators are amazing with record low unemployment and record highs on the stock market while that looks wonderful one has to wonder what s underpinning those numbers has the gnp really gone up that much or is something else going on one of the things which few people see is that quantitative easing is still going on what started out as a temporary patch to our economic system after the 2008 stock market crash has become a permanent fixture in our national economy as well as throughout europe with quantitative easing the federal reserve bank issues a set amount of new money every day releasing it into the economy it s a bit more complicated than that but for our purposes we don t need to know the details about how they actually do that the point is they are so every day there are more dollars in existence than there were the day before this extra cash is a large part of why the stock market is doing so good the dollar is weak making stocks a more attractive investment but the dollar is also being devalued which naturally drives up the relative value of stocks since those stocks are valued in dollars values on the stock market continue to rise what s surprising is that the quantitative easing isn t causing a corresponding rise in inflation even with it still in place the current inflation rate is extremely low hovering around zero there have even been months in which the inflation rate has been a negative number showing deflation rather than inflation yet it is doubtful that this can continue even more scary than that is that some well known economists are comparing our current economic conditions to those of the 1930s saying that we re heading towards the second great depression we re not talking fly by the seat of the pants conspiracy theory here but some of the great economists of our time related 15 weird foods that were common during the great depression how can this be happening how can we be flying high with record low unemployment and job creation while still having record highs on the stock market there are three major economic forces which are pushing us that way 1 the end of the long term dept cycle as a country we ve become accustomed to using economic stimuli to bail us out whenever there is a pending financial downturn but here at the end of the long term dept cycle there are no more stimuli to use it s hard to drop the prime lending rate when the interest rate is already at zero 2 the large wealth gap coupled with political polarity the wealth gap something that always exists is changing we re seeing the middle class disappear the good news is that most of those who are leaving the middle class are doing so because they are joining the upper class but there s bad news too that is people aren t moving up from the lower class to join the middle class 3 a rising world power challenging an existing world power china is working hard to attain superpower status putting them in direct conflict with the existing world power the usa this is happening on a number of levels including financially china s historic disregard for things like patents and other proprietary rights has enabled them to produce products cheaply but it has also caused huge amounts of resentment the conflict with china has only resulted in trump imposing import tariffs so far but that could change at any time while it is clear that trump is only doing that as a negotiating tool to get chinese markets to open up to us goods the reaction of the chinese is hard to gauge that strategy could blow up in our faces one concern is that president trump is not familiar enough with monetary policy from the government s side of the equation he s looking at things like the businessman he is that weakness is something that others could capitalize on and he has plenty of enemies looking to capitalize on it some of these people control the strings behind the world s biggest banks as well as the world s federal reserve banks these people have the ability to make anything happen financially speaking that they want to that anything includes causing a major financial crash if they see that it would be to their benefit to do so these same people are either some of or associated with the driving forces behind a one world government something that trump s populist nationalism is fighting against that alone could be enough to drive them to allow the economy to crash as a move to drive voters to whichever democrat candidate is finally selected to run against trump in the presidential elections if there is anything that could unseat the sitting president this is it should a major hiccup happen in our economy the president and the federal reserve bank will find their hands somewhat tied in dealing with it normal monetary policies won t work as they have been used to their limit monetary policy 1 lowering interest rates they can t be lowered when they are already at rock bottom monetary policy 2 printing money which we re already doing monetary policy 3 large budget deficits which are already a problem as our national debt continues to rise related investing for preppers 12 things that won t lose value in a crisis the one solution that still exists is to lower federal governmental spending but trump s hands have been tied every time he s tried this the democrats have no wish to make the government smaller and the republicans don t seem to want to either part of the problem is that every time you remove something from the government you eliminate a real benefit to citizens somewhere those citizens tend to scream loudly when that happens especially if they are on the political left that screaming is not good especially in an election year but even without an election year politicians of all stripes try to avoid the negative optics it creates so that it doesn t affect their chance of reelection this leaves us in a situation where any negative hit on the economy can t be effectively dealt with by the normal means unless the president can come up with a another means of stimulating the economy his hands will be tied when that hit comes without the ability to stimulate the economy effectively we could very well face an economic downturn that takes years to recover from you and i need to be ready for this to happen while we don t know when and how it might we do know that the potential is there we can also see that it will be much more than a momentary blip in the economic indicators it will move in and stay a while that sounds like the kind of disaster we must be ready for you may also like 50 tips from the great depression us nuclear target map do you live in the danger zone video do you know your rights under

by jerome mario utomi it s been argued for a very long time that some knowledge of history is useful to the scientist the economist or the student of literature or philosophy on the grounds that no science or art is static this argument by strategic thinkers has its background on the premise that historical science begins with reaction to the imagined happenings of the past history however is the reconstruction of the past by and for those who are living of the life of those who are dead it is a tool of all discipline and the key to wisdom people who ignore the lessons of history wonder in dilemma the usefulness of the above words of wisdom played out on august 1995 during an address by harvard political professor samuel huntington at taipei he was asked of his impression about prime minister lee kuan yew s effort to develop singapore and he scantly summed it up this way the honesty and efficiency senior minister lee has brought to singapore are likely to follow him to his grave however like faith which is a belief in things not seen coupled with the fact that ordinary calculation can be upturned by extra ordinary personalities not only did lee s efficiency survive him but history has since assisted in providing answers to the correctness or otherwise of professor samuel huntington declaration accordingly its now on public domain that two years after the asymmetrical observation singapore a country with a gdp of 3billion in 1965 grew to 46billion in 1997 making it the 8th highest per capital gnp in the world according to the world bank ranking clearly a bracing account and unprecedented result what is however left for those who are living is to learn the lessons from such history and gain wisdom or ignore it and wonder in dilemma essentially the crux of this piece is to use singapore s experience under prime minister lee quen yew to analyze and understand the essential ingredients of foresight in leadership and draw a lesson on how leadership decision making process involves judgement about uncertain elements and differs from the pure mathematical probability process from accounts aside from the fact that the story of singapore s progress is a reflection of the advances of the industrial countries their inventions technology enterprise and drive a united and a determined group of leaders backed by practical and hard working people who trust them made it possible it is part of the story of a leader s search for new fields to increase the wealth and well being of his people the second and most profound lesson was lee s explanation that after grappling with the problems of unemployment in the country he came to the recognition that the only way to survive was to industrialize add just immediately he concentrated on getting factories started despite their small domestic market of 2 million he protected locally assembled cars refrigerator air conditioners radios television sets and tape recorder in the hope that they would later be partly manufactured locally there is certainly an ingrain lesson for the nation nigeria to draw from this second position considering the slow growing economy but scary unemployment levels in the country the current administration in my opinion will continue to find itself faced with difficulty accelerating the economic life cycle of the nation until they contemplate industrialization or productive collaboration with private organizations that has surplus capital to create employment another alternative recourse will probably be to move part of the job creation functions and infrastructural provision development to the state and local government authorities via restructuring structural interventions while the first option industrialization may offer considerable solution the second and third options restructuring productive collaboration with private organizations has more potential reward in political and socioeconomic terms as well as come with a reduced risk to achieve such feat power electricity and other infrastructure roads need to be addressed notably not doing any of this or continuing on the low growth of the economy will amplify the painful consequence of strategic mistakes made by previous administrations that failed to invest during the period of rapid economic growth in my views the nation has to do this because history teaches that democracy needs economic development literacy a growing middle class and political institution that support citizens with favourable economic environment to survive this leads to another set of sad narrative presently nigeria is a country that services its debt with 50 of its annual revenue we don t need to be economists to know that we have become a high risk borrower the country going by reports would be facing another round of fiscal headwinds this year with the mix of 83 billion debt rising recurrent expenditure increased cost of debt servicing sustained fall in revenue and about 22 billion debt plan waiting for legislative approval it may be worse if the anticipated shocks from the global economy like the brexit the united states china trade war and interest rate policy of the federal reserve bank go awry the nation s debt stock currently at 83billion comes with huge debt service provision in excess of n2 1 trillion in 2019 but set to rise in 2020 this challenge stems from the country s revenue crisis which has remained unabating in the last five years while the borrowings have persisted an indication that the economy has been primed for recurring tough outcomes the report concluded indeed the question may be asked why the country s revenue crisis remained unabated in the last five years within the context the answer lies in the fundamental recognition that here is a country reputed for crude oil dependence and laced with management system devoid of accountability transparency and accuracy and before a real solution can be proffered we need as a nation to find and understand the sources of the national problems without losing sight of the real and lasting meaning wrapped in the lesson as an illustration the nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti few days ago told nigerians that the nation loses about 4 1 or n123billion annually due to poor crude oil production metering stating that unless government takes appropriate measures limitations in the metering of crude oil production will continue to pose serious threat to the nation s revenue target regrettably nigeria is the only oil producing country without adequate metering to ascertain the accurate quantity of crude oil produced at any given time the report concluded what the above tells us as a country is that there is more work to be done more reforms to be made that as a nation we are poor not because of our geographical location or due to absence of mineral natural resources but because our leaders fail to take decisions that engineer prosperity and we cannot solve our socio economic challenges with the same thinking we used when we created it and this piece may not unfold completely the answers to these challenges but there are a few sectors that a nation desirous of development can start from and the first that comes to mind is the urgent need for diversification of the nation s revenue sources revenue diversification from what developments experts are saying will provides options for the nation reduce financial risks and increase national economic stability as a decline in particular revenue source might be offset by increase in other revenue

by the saker trump has been accused of not thinking forward of not having a long term strategy regarding the consequences of assassinating general suleimani does the united states in fact have a strategy in the near east or is it only ad hoc michael hudson of course american strategists will deny that the recent actions do not reflect a deliberate strategy because their long term strategy is so aggressive and exploitative that it would even strike the american public as being immoral and offensive if they came right out and said it president trump is just the taxicab driver taking the passengers he has accepted pompeo and vp pence saying take us to the rapture along with bolton s progeges and the iran derangement syndrome neocons wherever they tell him they want to be driven they want to pull a heist and he s being used as the getaway driver fully accepting his role their plan is to hold onto the main source of their international revenue saudi arabia and the surrounding near eastern oil export surpluses and money they see the us losing its ability to exploit russia and china and look to keep europe under its control by monopolizing key sectors so that it has the power to use sanctions to squeeze er countries that resist turning over control of their economies and natural rentier monopolies to us buyers in short us strategists would like to do to europe and the near east just what they did to russia under yeltsin turn over public infrastructure natural resources and the banking system to u s owners relying on us dollar credit to fund their domestic government spending and private investment this is basically a resource grab suleimani was in the same position as chile s allende libya s qaddafi iraq s saddam the motto is that of stalin no person no problem the saker your answer raises a question about israel in your recent article you only mention israel twice and these are only passing comments furthermore you also clearly see the us oil lobby as much more crucial than the israel lobby so here is my follow up question to you on what basis have you come to this conclusion and how powerful do you believe the israel lobby to be compared to say the oil lobby or the us military industrial complex to what degree do their interests coincide and to what degree to they differ hudson i wrote my article to explain the most basic concerns of u s international diplomacy the balance of payments dollarizing the global economy basing foreign central bank savings on loans to the u s treasury to finance the military spending mainly responsible for the international and domestic budget deficit oil and the enormous revenue produced by the international oil trade and recruitment of foreign fighters given the impossibility of drafting domestic u s soldiers in sufficient numbers from the time these concerns became critical to today israel was viewed as a u s military base and supporter but the u s policy was formulated independently of israel i remember one day in 1973 or 74 i was traveling with my hudson institute colleague uzi arad later a head of mossad and advisor to netanyahu to asia stopping off in san francisco at a quasi party a u s general came up to uzi and clapped him on the shoulder and said you re our landed aircraft carrier in the near east and expressed his friendship uzi was rather embarrassed but that s how the u s military thought of israel back then by that time the three planks of u s foreign policy strategy that i outlined were already firmly in place of course netanyahu has applauded u s moves to break up syria and trump s assassination choice but the move is a u s move and it s the u s that is acting on behalf of the dollar standard oil power and mobilizing saudi arabia s wahabi army israel fits into the u s structured global diplomacy much like turkey does they and other countries act opportunistically within the context set by u s diplomacy to pursue their own policies obviously israel wants to secure the golan heights hence its opposition to syria and also its fight with lebanon hence its opposition to iran as the backer of assad and hezbollah this dovetails with us policy but when it comes to the global and u s domestic response it s the united states that is the determining active force and its concern rests above all with protecting its cash cow of saudi arabia as well as working with the saudi jihadis to destabilize governments whose foreign policy is independent of u s direction from syria to russia wahabis in chechnya to china wahabis in the western uighur region the saudis provide the underpinning for u s dollarization by recycling their oil revenues into u s financial investments and arms purchases and also by providing and organizing the isis terrorists and coordinating their destruction with u s objectives both the oil lobby and the military industrial complex obtain huge economic benefits from the saudis therefore to focus one sidedly on israel is a distraction away from what the us centered international order really is all about the saker in your recent article you wrote the assassination was intended to escalate america s presence in iraq to keep control the region s oil reserves others believe that the goal was precisely the opposite to get a pretext to remove the us forces from both iraq and syria what are your grounds to believe that your hypothesis is the most likely one hudson why would killing suleimani help remove the u s presence he was the leader of the fight against isis especially in syria us policy was to continue using isis to permanently destabilize syria and iraq so as to prevent a shi ite crescent reaching from iran to lebanon which incidentally would serve as part of china s belt and road initiative so it killed suleimani to prevent the peace negotiation he was killed because he had been invited by iraq s government to help mediate a rapprochement between iran and saudi arabia that was what the united states feared most of all because it effectively would prevent its control of the region and trump s drive to seize iraqi and syrian oil so using the usual orwellian doublethink suleimani was accused of being a terrorist and assassinated under the u s 2002 military authorization bill giving the president to move without congressional approval against al qaeda trump used it to protect al qaeda s terrorist isis offshoots given my three planks of u s diplomacy described above the united states must remain in the near east to hold onto saudi arabia and try to make iraq and syria client states equally subservient to u s balance of payments and oil policy certainly the saudis must realize that as the buttress of u s aggression and terrorism in the near east their country and oil reserves are the most obvious target to speed the parting guest i suspect that this is why they are seeking a rapprochement with iran and i think it is destined to come about at least to provide breathing room and remove the threat the iranian missiles to iraq were a demonstration of how easy it would be to aim them at saudi oil fields what then would be aramco s stock market valuation the saker in your article you wrote the major deficit in the u s balance of payments has long been military spending abroad the entire payments deficit beginning with the korean war in 1950 51 and extending through the vietnam war of the 1960s was responsible for forcing the dollar off gold in 1971 the problem facing america s military strategists was how to continue supporting the 800 u s military bases around the world and allied troop support without losing america s financial leverage i want to ask a basic really primitive question in this regard who cares about the balance of payments as long as 1 the us continues to print money 2 most of the world will still want dollars does that not give the us an essentially infinite budget what is the flaw in this logic hudson the u s treasury can create dollars to spend at home and the fed can increase the banking system s ability to create dollar credit and pay debts denominated in us dollars but they cannot create foreign currency to pay other countries unless they willingly accept dollars ad infinitum and that entails bearing the costs of financing the u s balance of payments deficit getting only ious in exchange for real resources that they sell to u s buyers this is the situation that arose half a century ago the united states could print dollars in 1971 but it could not print gold in the 1920s germany s reichsbank could print deutsche marks trillions of them when it came to pay germany s foreign reparations debt all it could do was to throw these d marks onto the foreign exchange market that crashed the currency s exchange rate forcing up the price of imports proportionally and causing the german hyperinflation the question is how many surplus dollars do foreign governments want to hold supporting the dollar standard ends up supporting u s foreign diplomacy and military policy for the first time since world war ii the most rapidly growing parts of the world are seeking to de dollarize their economies by reducing reliance on u s exports u s investment and u s bank loans this move is creating an alternative to the dollar likely to replace it with groups of other currencies and assets in national financial reserves the saker in the same article you also write so maintaining the dollar as the world s reserve currency became a mainstay of u s military spending we often hear people say that the dollar is about to tank and that as soon as that happens then the us economy and according to some the eu economy too will collapse in the intelligence community there is something called tracking the indicators and warnings my question to you is what are the economic indicators and warnings of a possible probable collapse of the us dollar followed by a collapse of the financial markets most tied to the dollar what shall people like myself i am an economic ignoramus keep an eye on and look for hudson what is most likely is a slow decline largely from debt deflation and cutbacks in social spending in the eurozone and us economies of course the decline will force the more highly debt leveraged companies to miss their bond payments and drive them into insolvency that is the fate of thatcherized economies but it will be long and painfully drawn out largely because there is little left wing socialist alternative to neoliberalism at present trump s protectionist policies and sanctions are forcing other countries to become self reliant and independent of us suppliers from farm crops to airplanes and military arms against the us threat of a cutoff or sanctions against repairs spare parts and servicing sanctioning russian agriculture has helped it become a major crop exporter and to become much more independent in vegetables dairy and cheese products the us has little to offer industrially especially given the fact that its it communications are stuffed with us spyware europe therefore is facing increasing pressure from its business sector to choose the non us economic alliance that is growing more rapidly and offers a more profitable investment market and more secure trade supplier countries will turn as much as possible diplomatically as well as financially and economically to non us suppliers because the united states is not reliable and because it is being shrunk by the neoliberal policies supported by trump and the democrats alike a byproduct probably will be a continued move toward gold as an alternative do the dollar in settling balance of payments deficits the saker finally my last question which country out there do you see as the most capable foe of the current us imposed international political and economic world order whom do you believe that us deep state and the neocons fear most china russia iran some other country how would you compare them and on the basis of what criteria the leading country breaking up us hegemony obviously is the united states itself that is trump s major contribution he is uniting the world in a move toward multi centrism much more than any ostensibly anti american could have done and he is doing it all in the name of american patriotism and nationalism the ultimate orwellian rhetorical wrapping trump has driven russia and china together with the other members of the shanghai cooperation organization sco including iran as observer his demand that nato join in us oil grabs and its supportive terrorism in the near east and military confrontation with russia in ukraine and elsewhere probably will lead to european ami go home demonstrations against nato and america s threat of world war iii no single country can counter the u s unipolar world order it takes a critical mass of countries this already is taking place among the countries that you list above they are simply acting in their own common interest using their own mutual currencies for trade and investment the effect is an alternative multilateral currency and trading area the united states is now turning on the screws demanding that other countries sacrifice their growth in order to finance the u s unipolar empire in effect foreign countries are beginning to respond to the united states what the ten tribes of israel said when they withdrew from the southern kingdom of judah whose king rehoboam refused to lighten his demands 1 kings 12 they echoed the cry of sheba son of bikri a generation earlier look after your own house o david the message is what do other countries have to gain by remaining in the us unipolar neoliberalized world as compared to using their own wealth to build up their own economies it s an age old problem the dollar will still play a role in us trade and investment but it will be as just another currency held at arms length until it finally gives up its domineering attempt to strip other countries wealth for itself however its demise may not be a pretty sight this interview first appeared on the saker

haven gold has found some stability towards the back end of the week around 1 550 not far from the levels we were trading at around at the start of the year gold will remain susceptible to safe haven dashes although the tragic airliner accident may force people to reconsider their actions and encourage a sustained de escalation the dollar has rebounded over the course of this week which may keep the downward pressure on the yellow metal although it s worth remembering that prior to the events of the last week the dollar was coming under a little pressure and supporting gold it will be interesting to see whether that continues going forward bitcoin like a slow puncture the bitcoin rally is slowly deflating but there s clearly some resilience there the cryptocurrency faces a test

australia has been devastated by catastrophic bushfires in all states across the continent the australian fire season used to encompass the 6 months of spring and summer but now encompasses 9 months from late winter to early autumn the effective climate change denialist and anti science coalition government has a major responsibility mechanical fuel reduction coupled with biochar charcoal carbon c generation is a possible mitigation avenue in a worsening climate change drought and warming driven disaster prospect 1 the catastrophic 2019 2020 australian bushfires by the numbers as of 10 january 2020 the numbers of hectares burned are as follows australian capital territory 0 new south wales 4 900 000 northern territory not available queensland 2 500 000 south australia 274 000 tasmania 32 000 victoria 1 200 000 and western australia 1 700 000 for a total of 10 700 000 hectares as of 10 january 2020 the numbers of people tragically killed are as follows australian capital territory 1 new south wales 20 northern territory 0 queensland 0 south australia 4 tasmania 0 victoria 3 and western australia 0 for a total of 28 bushfire related deaths as of 10 january 2020 the numbers of homes destroyed are as follows australian capital territory 0 new south wales 1 687 northern territory 5 queensland 48 south australia 161 tasmania 2 victoria 300 and western australia 1 for a total of 2 204 homes destroyed these terrible numbers are set to increase with the global warming impacted new normal of an australian bushfire season likely to extend for a further 3 4 months i e through the remainder of summer and early autumn large areas of eastern new south wales and eastern victoria have been subject to declarations of emergency the australian defence force adf has been involved on land air and sea and about 100 000 people have been evacuated to safety these australian bushfires have variously commenced in july winter 2019 and are likely to extend into march and april autumn 2020 the extension of the new normal bushfire season into cooler and wetter autumn and winter months has reduced the ability of various fire services to safely conduct fuel hazard reduction burning to minimize the forest and grassland fuel load there are 100 hectares per square kilometer so the area of australia burned so far 10 700 000 hectares 107 000 square kilometers is 1 4 of the area of australia 7 7 million square kilometres 44 1 of the area of england 242 495 square kilometres and 93 4 of the combined area of belgium the netherlands and denmark 114 600 square kilometres the burning continues 2 the 2019 2020 australian bushfires have so far emitted 750 mt co2 e according to the official data of the australian government department of energy and the environment australia s domestic greenhouse gas ghg emissions had been steadily decreasing under successive labor governments 2007 2013 but have been steadily rising since the pro coal pro gas pro fossil fuels and variously climate change denialist or effective climate change denialist liberal party national party coalition came to power on the basis of a dishonest anti science and environmentally disastrous slogan of no carbon tax dr niels andela nasa goddard space flight center and a collaborator in the global fire emissions database gfed has estimated from satellite data that in the period 1 august 2019 13 december 2019 the nsw bushfires have emitted 195 mt co2 equivalent co2 e and the queensland fires another 55 mt co2 e this corresponding to 47 australia s annual domestic carbon pollution of 532 mt co2 e however the sydney morning herald based on updated estimates from dr pep canadell a senior research scientist for csiro and the executive director of the global carbon project 2 january 2020 australia s annual industrial emissions budget in 2018 19 was 532 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent this season s bushfires which have burnt through more than 5 million hectares across the country are estimated to have released two thirds of this amount or about 350 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so far until recently australia s forests were thought to reabsorb all the carbon released in bushfires meaning they achieved net zero emissions but scientists say climate change drought and escalating fires combined are reducing forests ability to reabsorb carbon the 350 million tonne figure was extrapolated from data on nasa s global fire emissions database issued two weeks ago for nsw s bushfires which at that stage had burnt 2 7 million hectares and emitted 190 million tonnes of carbon dioxide however wikipedia reports that as of 8 january 2020 in the australian 2019 20 bushfire season 10 7 million hectares have burned since june 2019 a bushfire season of 10 months rather than the previous spring summer norm of 6 months accordingly total bushfire emissions 190 mt co2 e x 10 7 mha 2 7 mha 753 mt co2 e or 1 4 times australia s annual domestic co2 e emissions ditto 350 mt co2 e x 10 7 mha 5 mha 749 mt co2 e i e australia s total emissions jumped this 2019 20 financial year from 532 mt co2 e to 532 mt co2 e 753 mt co2 e 1 285 mt co2 e with 3 4 months to go 3 huge loss of forest photosynthetic co2 capture capacity missing in this accounting is the immense and prolonged loss of photosynthetic co2 capture capacity by south east australian eucalyptus forests that can be the best forest carbon sinks in the world as reported by keith et al 2009 from analysis of published global site biomass data n 136 from primary forests we discovered i the world s highest known total biomass carbon density living plus dead of 1 867 tonnes carbon per ha average value from 13 sites occurs in australian temperate moist eucalyptus regnans forest the bushfires are not only generating ghg emission greater than the national annual emissions they are also causing a major loss of the ability of 107 000 square kilometres of horrendously burned bush to sequester co2 through photosynthesis 4 serious long term health impacts from toxic pollutants from bushfires far more serious for humans is the long term impact on health of prolonged exposure to elevated co carbon monoxide n2o nitrous oxide no2 nitrogen dioxide so2 sulphur dioxide and pm2 5 deadly fine carbon particulates especially in smoke blanketed population dense sydney canberra and melbourne 8 million people die world wide from air pollution each year who with this including about 3 8 million from indoor household pollution 4 2 million from ambient outdoor pollution 10 000 londoners 10 000 australians and 75 000 people from the long term effects of pollutants from the burning of australia s world leading coal exports these presently catastrophic australian bushfires will have a deadly harvest in the long term 5 mechanical fuel load reduction mflr may help reduce the likelihood and severity of bushfires f ximines et al 2017 australia is the most fire prone of all continents with large areas of the country affected by bushfires each year bushfires can have profound impacts on communities and on the environment traditionally prescribed burns have been used as a fuel reduction treatment however the proportion of land that is subjected to prescribed burns in australia has decreased since 1990 this is partly due to the increasingly smaller windows of opportunity available to conduct burns safely concerns about operational costs health impacts from smoke and the social acceptability of prescribed burning these issues suggest a need for considering alternative fuel reduction approaches in select urban and rural areas such as the potential for mechanical fuel load reduction mflr treatments the aim of mflr is to reduce size likelihood and severity of bushfires 6 the us market price of biochar charcoal carbon c from forestry and agricultural waste is 2 580 per ton once cellulosic biomass is mechanically harvested it can be transported and converted to biochar charcoal carbon c through anaerobic pyrolysis at 400 700 c the biochar can then be added back to soils safely sequestered underground e g in old coal mines or used for other purposes e g as an activated carbon substitute for filtration of polluted air or water farm energy 2019 biochar is charred biomass which is added to soil to improve soil health and soil quality the solid charcoal like substance is created using a process known as pyrolysis which is basically the heating of biomass to a high temperature 400 degrees c in the absence of oxygen the addition of biochar to soils is actually an ancient technique that was used by early civilizations to enhance soil productivity the potential importance of biochar was recognized when anthropologists discovered dark highly fertile soils in the middle of the amazon rain forest it is speculated that thousands of years ago farmers living in the amazon engineered the terra preta soils called terra preta or black earth in portuguese by adding biochar along with fish bones and other organic residues to the otherwise infertile soils similar soil enhancement practices have also been discovered by early farming cultures in japan south america and africa the biochar enriched soils have been shown to have significantly higher organic carbon content higher water holding capacity higher nutrient holding capacity and lower nutrient leaching rates compared to adjacent soils that have not been amended with biochar the report found that a majority of the global market share comes from the us 65 followed by europe 25 asia 7 and africa 3 ninety percent 90 of commercial activity is focused on small specialty retail markets mostly nursery and garden centers a small percentage 10 is focused on larger scale markets such as agriculture or land remediation projects it has been reported that japan has a growing commercial biochar industry with approximately 15 000 tons traded annually okimori et al 2003 in 2011 94 159 tons of compost a common soil amendment was sold at a price of 30 50 per ton usda ers 2011 the price per ton for biochar is far higher and the volumes far lower companies responding to the ibi survey reported sales of only 911 tons in 2013 sixty five percent 597 tons of which was produced in north america the average price for biochar in the us was 1 29 per pound or 2 580 per ton in the near term due to price point biochar will likely only be used in high end specialty markets but there is growing interest in developing biochar into new products that take advantage of its unique chemical properties for example today wastewater treatment facilities purchase thousands of tons of activated carbon annually to help absorb potential contaminants and reduce odors biochar has been shown to be a cost effective alternative 7 a possible 9 12 gt biochar carbon from forestry and agricultural waste annually versus 9 gt carbon pollution annually from industry i wrote the following a decade ago on the amount of biochar that could be potentially generated annually from waste forestry and agricultural cellulosic biomass 2009 thus p224 progress in thermochemical biomass conversion volume 1 iae bioenergy ed a v bridgewater blackwell science informs us that we could obtain 1 7 gtc yr straw from agriculture 4 2 gtc yr total grass upgrowth from grasslands upgrowth 6 gtc yr possible sustainable woodharvest 11 9 gtc yr from this one can see why biochar expert professor johannes lehmann of cornell university is correct calculating that it is realistically possible to fix 9 5bn tonnes of carbon per year using biochar noting that global annual production of carbon from fossil fuels is 8 5bn tonnes according to a uk guardian report johannes lehmann of cornell university has calculated that it is realistically possible to fix 9 5bn tonnes of carbon per year using biochar the global production of carbon from fossil fuels stands at 8 5bn tonnes one can see also why professor lovelock frs is also correct in his assessment there is one way we could save ourselves and that is through the massive burial of charcoal it would mean farmers turning all their agricultural waste which contains carbon that the plants have spent the summer sequestering into non biodegradable charcoal and burying it in the soil then you can start shifting really hefty quantities of carbon out of the system and pull the co 2 down quite fast the biosphere pumps out 550 gigatonnes of carbon yearly we put in only 30 gigatonnes ninety nine per cent of the carbon that is fixed by plants is released back into the atmosphere within a year or so by consumers like bacteria nematodes and worms what we can do is cheat those consumers by getting farmers to burn their crop waste at very low oxygen levels to turn it into charcoal which the farmer then ploughs into the field a little co 2 is released but the bulk of it gets converted to carbon you get a few per cent of biofuel as a by product of the combustion process which the farmer can sell this scheme would need no subsidy the farmer would make a profit this is the one thing we can do that will make a difference but i bet they won t do it professor lovelock s estimates are consonant with those of dr j a harrison specifically a terrestrial carbon fixation of 121 3 gtc y 449 gt co2 449 billion tonnes of co2 of which about half returns annually to the atmosphere through animal and plant respiration and most of the remaining half returns to the air through the action of soil fungi and bacteria 8 massive and fraudulent ignoring of carbon pollution externality costs is leading to ecocide speciescide climate genocide and ultimately to omnicide and terracide fundamental to chemistry and physics are the 3 laws of thermodynamics specifically 1 the energy of a closed system is constant 2 the entropy disorder chaos lack of information content strives to a maximum and 3 zero motion in a perfect crystal at absolute zero degrees kelvin 273 15 degrees centigrade polya s 3 laws of economics mirror the 3 laws of thermodynamics and are 1 price minus cop cost of production equals profit 2 deception about cop strives to a maximum and 3 no work price or profit on a dead planet these fundamental laws help expose the failure of neoliberal capitalism in relation to wealth inequality massive tax evasion by multinational corporations and horrendous avoidable deaths from poverty and pollution culminating in general ecocide speciescide climate genocide omnicide and terracide it is now effectively too late to avoid a catastrophic plus 2 degrees centigrade temperature rise but we are nevertheless obliged to do everything we can to make the future less bad for future generations critical to intergenerational justice and intergenerational equity is the notion of carbon debt carbon price that is simply the damage related cost of greenhouse gas ghg pollution that if not addressed now will inescapably have to be paid by future generations thus for example if sea walls are not built then coastal populations will drown or be displaced however ghg emissions continue to rise inexorably and there is presently no global program to draw down co2 from the atmosphere to a safe and sustainable pre industrial revolution level of about 300 ppm co2 as advocated by many scientists and science informed activists nevertheless ghg pollution and negative consequences in numerous areas notably ecocide and speciescide are relentlessly increasing to the point of exceedance or near exceedance of critical tipping points for massive irreversible changes to hugely impact humanity and the biosphere 18 20 23 38 eminent physicist professor steven hawking has succinctly summarized our dire circumstance thus we see great peril if governments and societies do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and to prevent further climate change facing this worsening existential threat young people as exemplified by teenage activist greta thunberg are now vociferously demanding massive climate action mendacious neoliberal capitalism falsely boasts of its efficiency and efficacy but in keeping with polya s second law of economics utterly ignores the huge economic externality of the social and environmental cost of pollution that should be added to the cost of production this constitutes the greatest fraud in australian and indeed human history climate change economist sir nicholas stern critically stated 2006 the science tells us that ghg emissions are an externality in other words our emissions affect the lives of others when people do not pay for the consequences of their actions we have market failure this is the greatest market failure the world has seen and also argued for an international programme to combat deforestation which contributes 15 20 of greenhouse gas emissions 2006 for 10 15bn 4 8 7 2bn per year a programme could be constructed that could stop up to half the deforestation social conservative but science trained pope francis has demanded that the environmental and social cost of pollution be fully borne by the polluters further noting the massive biodiversity loss and the 100 1 000 fold greater species extinction rate in the present anthropocene era we must not destroy what we cannot replace and any species is priceless 9 damage related cost of carbon pollution 200 per tonne co2 saving 12 gt c as biochar annually saves 8 8 trillion per annum dr chris hope cambridge has estimated a damage related carbon price of 200 per tonne co2 but the imf has determined that average global carbon price is presently a mere 2 per tonne co2 dr chris hope judge business school 90 nobel laureate university of cambridge uk has estimated the damage related cost of carbon pollution 2011 if the best current scientific and economic evidence is to be believed and climate change could be a real and serious problem the appropriate response is to institute today a climate change tax equal to the mean estimate of the damage caused by a tonne of co2 emissions the raw calculations from the default page09 model suggest the tax should be about 100 per tonne of co2 in the eu but correcting for the limited time horizon of the model and bringing the calculations forward to 2102 in year 2012 dollars brings the suggested tax up to about 150 per tonne of co2 there are good arguments for setting the initial tax at about 250 per tonne of co2 in the us while starting off at a much lower level maybe 15 per tonne of co2 in the poorest regions of the world all in the year 2012 in year 2012 dollars that such policy advice would not pass the laugh test particularly in the us shows that the rhetoric about getting to grips with climate change has not been seriously thought through to its logical conclusion as a result rather than falling greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to rise le quere et al 2009 a fiscally neutral significant climate change tax is the best chance we have of bringing the climate change problem under control an international monetary fund imf report on climate change mitigation advocates a carbon tax of 75 per ton of co2 by 2030 that if progressively implemented in the g20 countries alone would prevent an estimated 4 million air pollution deaths by 2030 however the effective climate change denialist coalition government of australia a g20 country that is among world leaders in 15 areas of climate criminality for detailed documentation see has flatly rejected a global carbon tax if all g20 countries followed australia s rejection of a global carbon tax then they would be complicit in an unconscionable climate genocide and climate holocaust killing 4 million people over the next decade professor james hansen et al of 96 nobel laureate columbia university have also arrived at a carbon price estimate of about 200 per tonne co2 2018 one ppm of co2 is 2 12 billion tons of carbon or about 7 77 billion tons of co2 recently keith et al 2018 achieved a cost breakthrough in carbon capture demonstrated with a pilot plant in canada cost of carbon capture not including the cost of transportation and storage of the co2 is 113 232 per ton of co2 thus the cost of extracting 1 ppm of co2 from the atmosphere is 878 1803 billion in other words the cost in a single year of closing the gap between reality and the ipcc scenario that limits climate change to 1 5 c is already about 1 trillion and that is without the cost of transporting and storing the co2 or consideration of whether there will be citizen objection to that transportation and storage this annual cost will rise rapidly unless there is a rapid slowdown in carbon emissions cost of co2 storage has been estimated as 10 20 tco2 based on a carbon price of 200 per tonne co2 requisite atmospheric co2 draw down from the present 407 ppm co2 over the next decade will cost up to 12 7 to 24 9 trillion annually for various 342 to 280 ppm co2 goals 10 at 200 per tonne co2 the real cost of the 2019 2020 australian bushfires so far and lives lost aside is 150 billion at 200 per tonne co2 the real cost of the australian bushfires so far is 750 mt co2 e x 200 per tonne co2 150 billion this ignoring lives lost by way of comparison the climate criminal australia government has committed about 2 billion over 2 years for a national bushfire recovery agency headed by andrew colvin apm oa a former commissioner of the australian federal police afp however the 150 billion cost of the 2019 20 australian bushfires is just the tip of the iceberg of the cost of the climate criminality of the coalition australian government thus australia s annual domestic carbon pollution is asserted by the australian government to be 532 mt co2 e and at 200 per tonne co2 this amounts to a cost of 106 billion per year but it gets worse taking land use into account and considering the global warming potential gwp of methane ch4 on a 20 year time frame circa 80 relative to the same mass of co2 rather than on a 100 year time frame 25 australia s annual per capita domestic ghg pollution in tonnes co2 equivalent per person per year is 52 9 or 116 if including its huge ghg generating exports assuming a present australian population of 25 million this translates to 1 323 mt co2 e or 2 900 mt co2 e if one includes australia s exported ghg pollution assuming a damage related carbon price of 200 per tonne co2 this in turn translates to a real cost of 265 billion or 580 billion if one includes australia s exported ghg pollution to put this into a wider australian national context the australian gdp was 1 9 trillion 2019 and the gross australian government debt was 552 billion 2017 thus australia s annual additional carbon debt 580 billion per year is similar to the accumulated gross australian government debt 552 billion of course humanity shares one ocean and one atmosphere with the australians and thus australia s annual additional carbon debt of 580 billion per year is imposed on all of humanity and represents an inescapable burden on all future generations at some point humanity and especially the young will tell climate criminal australia to stop it 11 85 000 preventable australian deaths annually from lifestyle or political choice reasons air pollution kills 8 million people each year with this including 75 000 annual deaths from the long term impact of pollutants from the burning of australia s world leading coal exports about 10 000 australians die each year from air pollution with 200 000 having died thus this century however this is just the tip of an iceberg of australian preventable deaths thus each year about 85 000 australians die preventably from life style and political choice reasons the breakdown including some overlaps being as follows 1 26 000 annual australian deaths from adverse hospital events 2 17 000 obesity related australian deaths 3 15 500 smoking related australian deaths 4 10 000 carbon burning pollution derived australian deaths 5 4 000 avoidable indigenous australian deaths 6 5 600 australian alcohol related deaths 7 2 900 australian suicides circa 100 being veterans 8 1 400 australian road deaths 9 630 australian opiate drug related deaths with 570 linked to us restoration of the taliban destroyed afghan opium industry 10 550 heat stress deaths and 11 300 australian homicides 80 being of women killed domestically 12 livestock deaths of australia s cattle 24 million beef cattle and 2 6 million dairy cows 9 are in the present bushfire area of australia s 71 million sheep and lambs 12 are in the present bushfire zone it is estimated that 100 000 animals may have perished so far in the bushfires there have been massive losses of wildlife notably of the iconic koala in queensland and new south wales harvesting of grasslands in bushfire threatened areas could have provided desperately needed fodder for livestock in drought impacted areas considerations of the confinement feeding watering and humane protection of livestock in bushfire threatened areas raise major humane and ethical questions 13 experts climate change is exacerbating drought and forest fires climate change is exacerbating drought and forest fires world wide as well as causing ice melting sea level rise and exacerbation of the intensity of tropical storms thus the expert australian climate council formerly the australian climate commission that was scrapped by the effective climate change denialist coalition government in 2013 on climate change impacting worsening drought in australia 2018 climate change is likely making drought conditions in southwest and southeast australia worse climate change has contributed to a southward shift in weather systems that typically bring cool season rainfall to southern australia since the 1970s late autumn and early winter rainfall has decreased by 15 percent in southeast australia and western australia s southwest region has experienced a 15 percent decline in cool season rainfall climate change is also driving an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot days and heatwaves in australia exacerbating drought conditions queensland and new south wales are currently in the grip of severe drought with drought declared for 16 4 percent of new south wales and 57 6 percent of queensland current drought conditions come after a 2016 2017 summer characterised by record breaking temperatures followed by a record dry winter rainfall over southern australia during autumn 2018 was the second lowest on record time spent in drought is projected to increase in the future across southern australia future drying trends in australia will be most pronounced over southwest western australia with total reductions in autumn and winter precipitation potentially as high as 50 percent by the late 21st century similarly the australian climate council has issued a report on the exacerbation of bushfire risk due to climate change 2019 key findings 1 the catastrophic unprecedented fire conditions currently affecting nsw and queensland have been aggravated by climate change bushfire risk was exacerbated by record breaking drought very dry fuels and soils and record breaking heat 2 bushfire conditions are now more dangerous than in the past the risks to people and property have increased and fire seasons have lengthened it is becoming more dangerous to fight fires in australia 3 the fire season has lengthened so substantially that it has already reduced opportunities for fuel reduction burning this means it is harder to prepare for worsening conditions 4 the costs of fighting fires are increasing australia relies on resource sharing arrangements between countries and states and territories within australia as seasons overlap and fires become more destructive governments will be increasingly constrained in their ability to share resources and the costs of tackling fires will increase 5 the government must develop an urgent plan to 1 prepare australian communities health and emergency services for escalating fire danger and 2 rapidly phase out the burning of coal oil and gas which is driving more dangerous fires in 2019 over 11 000 scientists signed up to a world scientists warning of a climate emergency that sets out trends in 24 climate related areas over the last 40 years reproduced here is my analysis of the bushfire related section of figure 2 l area burned in the united states million hectares per year involves very scattered data however assuming the authors quasi linear best fit involving an increase from 0 9 1983 to 3 2 2018 one can estimate an increase of 0 066 million hectares per year 44 1 per decade 4 4 per year extrapolating from this average yields an estimate of 4 0 million hectares burned in 2030 comments in 2019 alone there have been massive forest fires in california the amazon and continent wide in australia the guardian australia the link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but according to major science agencies clear climate change does not create bushfires but it can and does make them worse a number of factors contribute to bushfire risk including temperature fuel load dryness wind speed and humidity the year coming into the 2019 20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of australia above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 had the fifth driest start to the year on record and the driest since 1970 australia recorded its hottest month in january 2019 its third hottest july and its hottest october day in some areas among other temperature records phys org has listed 10 ways in which climate change can variously make wildfires worse 1 hot dry windy weather 2 more plant fuel 3 change of plant species to more flammable dryness compatible species 4 last drop transpiration by thirsty plants 5 more lightning 6 differential warming of the arctic and a weakened jet stream this sinking drier and hotter air 7 the periodic el nino events lead to decreased rainfall increased temperatures and increased fire risk in indonesia and eastern australia 8 increase in the intensity of bushfires to unstoppable 9 increased winter survival of pine beetles with increased flammable dead wood in canadian boreal forests 10 positive feedback from increased co2 increased warming increased forest fires increased co2 increased warming the link between global warming and more forest fires has been documented by expert scientists for many years e g see 14 coalition ruled australia is among world leaders in 15 areas of effective climate change denialism and climate criminality a climate criminal australia is among world leaders in 15 areas relating to ghg pollution and hence climate criminality as confirmed by the results of the recent australian federal election that returned an anti science climate criminal coalition government a rich greedy and anti science australia is mindlessly committed to coal and gas exploitation thanks to the homicidal greed of climate criminal countries such as australia the present plus 1 1c temperature rise is already devastating island nations and a catastrophic plus 2c warming is now effectively unavoidable on present trends climate criminal australia is among world leaders for the following 15 climate criminal activities or parameters 1 annual per capita greenhouse gas pollution 2 live methanogenic livestock exports 3 natural gas exports 4 recoverable shale gas reserves that can be accessed by hydraulic fracturing fracking 5 coal exports 6 land clearing deforestation and ecocide 7 speciescide or species extinction 8 coral reef destruction 9 whale killing and extinction threat through global warming impacting on krill stocks 10 terminal carbon pollution budget exceedance 11 per capita carbon debt 12 ultimately ghg generating iron ore exports 13 climate change inaction 14 climate genocide and approach towards omnicide and terracide and 15 increasing domestic ghg pollution despite paris commitments to lower ghg pollution for detailed documentation see pm scott scomo morrison heads a pro coal pro gas pro oil pro fossil fuels anti science anti environment and right wing coalition government one third climate change deniers and two thirds effective climate change deniers through resolute climate change inaction morrison notoriously held up a lump of coal in the australian parliament idiotically declaring this is coal don t be afraid don t be scared pm morrison was on holiday overseas as the bushfire tragedy unfolded as was the defence minister and the new south wales emergency minister on his return after public outcry morrison attended a bushfires press conference at which the fire and police chiefs and the new south wales premier were grim faced but scomo grinned throughout his first major announcement on his return was that of 2 gas fired power stations to be built in gatton queensland and dandenong melbourne victoria respectively with the possibility of some coal fired power stations also being built utter irresponsibility and ignoring the reality of fossil fuel burning driving global warming drought and bushfires see section 13 above pro coal coalition mps got in the act and declared that it was not the time to discuss climate change during the bushfire emergency however greens leader dr di natale was not intimidated declaring yet with queensland and new south wales burning the coalition government refuses to acknowledge this scientific reality and instead wants to use taxpayer dollars to fund new coal fired power stations every politician lobbyist pundit and journalist who has fought to block serious action on climate change bears responsibility for the increasing risk from a heating planet that is producing these deadly bushfires the coalition then politically exploited the bushfires by drafting 3 000 army reservists a much more expensive option than using the regular defence forces and announced financial measures for the bushfires including 2 billion over 2 years for a national bushfire recovery agency however the coalition then politicized these actions by boasting about them on a slick social media presentation a major fire chief was evidently upset over not having been consulted retired fire chiefs who had collectively but unsuccessfully sought timely meetings with government to warn of the danger were effectively ignored some people involved on the ground in the bushfire tragedy refused to shake hands with morrison and then a coalition mp and critic of climate change action outraged uk media by ignorantly denying any connection between climate change and the australian bushfires final comments the australian bushfires are a nation wide tragedy involving as of 10 january 2020 10 700 000 hectares burned 28 deaths 2 204 homes destroyed and massive killing of native animals and livestock yet the burning may continue for several more months of summer and thence into the beginning of autumn while scientists including the australian climate council had been warning of worsening drought and bushfire risk for years the effective climate change denialist coalition government backed by right wing oligopoly media ignored the science under the climate criminal coalition australia is among world leaders in 15 areas of climate criminality australia with 0 3 of the world s population is responsible for 4 5 of ghg emissions exports included climate criminal australia s anti science profligacy also impacts the whole world through climate change and air pollution deaths thus for example the australian coalition government approved a modified adani coal mining coal for india scheme in queensland but it was estimated that toxic pollutants from burning the coal from the full blown initial proposal would eventually kill 1 4 million indians over the life time of the huge mine to reiterate the words of australian greens leader dr di natale every politician lobbyist pundit and journalist who has fought to block serious action on climate change bears responsibility for the increasing risk from a heating planet that is producing these deadly bushfires what will threatened humanity do around the world the world will eventually lose patience with a climate criminal australia and take action via green tariffs international criminal court prosecutions international court of justice litigations

mergers acquisitions looms in nigeria s financial institutions over central bank s planned minimum capital increase requirement naija247news has learned thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe nigerian banks will find it challenging to grow earnings and expand their operations this year because of a slow economic recovery and low interest rates according to an industry body it s going to be tough in 2020 for banks uche olowu the president of the chartered institute of bankers of nigeria told reporters in lagos on thursday banks are changing strategies to focus on new areas in agriculture financial technology and nigeria s creative industries to grow their operations he said plans by the central bank to increase minimum capital requirements for banks in 2020 may trigger mergers and acquisitions in the industry olowu said calls for banks to go for higher capital base have been on for years and have in many cases succeeded a new demand for bank recapitalisation was announced earlier in 2019 by central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele he said in the next five years we intend to pursue a programme of recapitalising the banking industry so as to position nigerian banks among the top 500 in the world banks will therefore be required to maintain higher level of capital as well as liquid assets in order to reduce the impact of an economic crisis on the financial system before that in april precisely a voice seeking higher capital for nigerian banks sounded loud and clear from a distant land director imf monetary and capital markets department tobias andrian had at the african session of the april 2019 spring meetings of the world bank advised nigeria to seek higher capital for its lenders through recapitalisation and also tackle rising non performing loans npls in the sector andrian s advice got a backing when emefiele unfolded the bank s policy direction for the next five years with recapitalisation of banks on the top list bank recapitalisation is expected to see lenders raising their capital base above the n25 billion minimum level instituted in 2004 the cbn boss also plans to lead the economy into double digit growth single digit inflation 12 billion non oil exports by 2023 and raising financial inclusion to 95 per cent level by 2024 while retaining the managed float exchange rate cbn guidelines stipulate that regional banks must have a minimum paid up capital of n10 billion national banks n25 billion and banks with international operations n50 billion speaking further on the recapitalisation plans emefiele said the 2004 banking industry recapitalisation which increased banks capital base from n2 billion to the current n25 billion had weakened he plans to pursue a programme that will make nigerian banks rank among the top 500 in the world according to the cbn governor s view the n25 billion capital base of commercial banks has weakened substantially industry leaders react president chairman of council chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn uche olowu said the cbn has industry data and right information on why banks should recapitalise he said recapitalisation would provide more funds for the lenders to business especially consumer credit mortgage finance which are yet to be given the desired consideration by banks he said recapitalisation would give banks the power to take advantage of opportunities in the industry and lend more to real sector he said many banks have eroded their capital due to high level of npls and that recapitalisation would present a new lifeline for the banks for me recapitalisation of the banks is fine i have no problem with that rather i see opportunities that it presents to the economy and the lenders it will be a healthy development for the banks to recapitalise normally from time to time there is always need for recapitalisation of the banking sector for banks with regional operations recapitalisa tion will enable them to raise the needed capital for more coverage olowu said it was in faraway united states of america that the international monetary fund imf asked nigerian banks to recapitalise and strengthen their capital bases if they must compete locally and globally higher capital requirements cardinalstone s nnebue also said raising minimum capital requirements for banks makes sense given that efforts to increase loan to deposit ratios could drag some banks on the capital adequacy front emefiele told local media in june that banks minimum capital bases were insufficient due to the sustained slump in the value of the nigerian naira since the last increase in capital requirements in 2005 it has fallen to 364 naira to the dollar as of aug 20 2019 from 138 naira in august 2005 according to local newspaper vanguard new capital base requirements for national banks and those with international licences could increase to 57 billion naira and 230 billion naira respectively this is an essential step compared with the large banks in south africa and morocco for example nigerian banks capital base is smaller said samira mensah director of emea financial services ratings at s p global ratings snl image nigerian banks also operate in very risky environments so that requires bigger capital buffers to protect lenders against economic volatility and credit losses it s the price of doing business in nigeria and other high risk economies ayodele akinwunmi head of research at fsdh merchant bank in lagos said the planned capital increase was motivated by a desire to ensure that credit flows through the economy more easily gdp will expand about 2 this year s p global ratings forecasts higher capital bases could cause banks return on equity to decline at least initially he said but this will improve as the new capital is deployed to generate additional income capital markets midtier nigerian banks with an international license that might undershoot the potential new capital requirements could switch to a national one should they struggle to increase their capital the banks will have that flexibility said mensah he said capital markets currently have not been especially conducive to holding rights issues but that this could change following february s presidential election and central bank moves to end a foreign exchange shortage nigeria s top tier banks have a fairly stable and diversified shareholding structure so they should be able to increase their capital base if need be the previous capital base increase in 2005 spurred widespread consolidation and the closure of around a dozen insolvent banks with the number of banks eventually falling to 25 from 89 as additional reforms in 2010 hastened sector consolidation further consolidation is ongoing with access bank plc recently taking over peer diamond bank plc to create africa s largest bank by customers in october 2019 nigeria s central bank increased its target for lending by commercial banks for the second time in three months to help boost growth banks that miss the target will face higher cash reserve requirements the bank in a circular dated sept 30 ordered lenders to increase their minimum loan to deposit ratio to 65 from 60 which it set in july it said those who fall short of the new target by december would have to maintain higher cash reserves the new lending target takes effect immediately and will be reviewed quarterly the central bank said economic growth in nigeria slowed to an annual rate of 1 94 in the three months to the end of june the second quarter in a row of declines as the country struggles to shake off the effects of a recession it escaped two years ago the bank has been trying to boost credit to businesses and consumers after that recession but lending has yet to pick up with growth slow banks prefer to park cash in risk free government securities rather than lend to companies and consumers the central bank said loans grew by 5 3 to 16 40 trillion as at the end of september the deadline it earlier set for lenders to boost their minimum loan to deposit ratios to 60 margin pressure the latest measure is designed to sustain the momentum the central bank said as it steps up efforts aimed at getting banks to play a bigger role in helping revive the economy in october new rule for new minimum capital requirements for microfinance banks in nigeria the central bank of nigeria has rolled out new regulations for microfinance banks mfbs in the country through a tier based system the monetary regulator also adjusted the time frame given to the different categories of microfinance banks operating in nigeria to recapitalise the review was followed up to the circular released last year on the review of minimum capital requirements for microfinance banks in nigeria the review categorised microfinance banks into the unit state and national operators the capital requirements for the units are as follows 1 unit microfinance banks previous requirement n20 million tier 2 unit microfinance banks operating only in the rural unbanked or underbanked areas revised capital n35 million threshold by april 2020 minimum capital n50 million threshold by april 2021 tier 1 unit microfinance banks operating in the urban and high density banked areas of the society revised capital n100 million threshold april 2020 minimum capital n200 million threshold april 2021 2 state microfinance banks previous requirement n100 million capital requirement n500 million by april 2020 capital requirement n1 billion by april 2021 3 national microfinance banks previous requirement n2 billion capital requirement n3 5 billion by april 2020 capital requirement n5 billion by april 2021 last year kevin amugo cbn s director financial policy and regulation department announced the increment in the minimum capital base of national mfbs to n5 billion from n2 million state s microfinance capital requirement increased to n1 billion from n100 million and unit mfbs from n20 million to n200 million the cbn explained that the revision became inevitable as the sector had been contending with challenges such as inadequate capital base weak corporate governance ineffective risk management practices among others it further stated that the new model for unit microfinance banks will ensure continued operations of microfinance banks in the rural unbanked and underbanked areas of the economy

net worth between 50 million and 1 billion and a 6 wealth tax on net worth greater than 1 billion the chart below compares the two proposals sanders s proposal warren s proposal tax rates for married

j and warren have each proposed mark to market taxes on wealthy and high income individuals each of these proposals would tax unrealized gains in publicly traded property and would impose an additional tax upon the sale of nontraded property each of the proposals would also increase the capital gains rate so that it is equal to the ordinary income rate for these taxpayers ron wyden s mark to market proposal wyden s mark to market proposal would apply to individuals estates or trusts with income in excess of 1 million or assets exceeding 10 million in each of the three prior tax years for purposes of determining whether the 10 million asset test is satisfied the first 2 million of combined value of a taxpayer s primary and secondary personal residences would be excluded the value of a taxpayer s operating family farm would be included only to the extent it exceeds 5 million and the first 3 million of a taxpayer s retirement savings would excluded these taxpayers would be required to mark to market their publicly traded assets on an annual basis and pay a tax on any appreciation or take a loss on any depreciation at the end of the tax year as if they had been sold in addition a look back charge would be imposed on gains from non publicly traded assets like closely held businesses investment real estate and art and collectibles upon a realization event which would generally include any transfers of these types of property or the death of the owner the look back charge would minimize any benefit of deferring the tax until disposition of the asset however the proposal requests comments as to whether the look back charge should be an interest charge on deferred tax a yield based tax or a surtax based on an asset s holding period proceeds from the primary and secondary residences of a taxpayer only in excess of 2 million and proceeds from a family farm only in excess of 5 million would be subject to the look back charge rule wyden s proposal would not apply to assets held in tax preferred savings accounts which would continue to be taxed in the same manner as under current law wyden s proposal would also include transition rules that would require taxpayers to pay tax on pre proposal built in gains over an unspecified period publicly traded corporations would generally not be subject to wyden s proposal but there would be anti abuse rules that would prevent taxpayers from using a corporation to avoid application of the mark to market rules the wyden proposal would apply the regime at the partner or s corporation shareholder level and an interest in a partnership or s corporation would generally be treated as a nontraded asset cory booker booker has proposed a mark to market tax that would apply in a manner similar to wyden s booker s proposal would impose a mark to market tax on publicly traded assets and a yield based tax upon the sale of non traded assets the yield based tax would result in the same tax as for the owner of publicly traded property assuming each appreciated on a constant basis and the taxpayer sold stock with a value equal to the tax in each year booker s plan would allow taxpayers to prepay taxes to minimize the yield based tax realization for these purposes would include death and transfers to other family members and entities as well as gifts of appreciated property to charities booker s proposal would also repeal section 1031 the like kind exchange which permits taxpayers to exchange real estate tax free booker s mark to market regime would apply only to gains realized after the taxpayer exceeds a 2 million lifetime exemption on combined realized and unrealized gains taxpayers below this threshold would continue to pay taxes on capital gains upon realization rather than under the mark to market regime pete buttigieg and elizabeth warren buttigieg and warren each have proposed a mark to market tax for the wealthiest 1 of individual taxpayers and to tax capital gains and dividends at ordinary income rates for these taxpayers only traded assets would be marked to market a separate but unspecified regime would apply to nontraded assets buttigieg and warren each estimate that this tax would generate over 2 trillion in revenue over 10 years alexandria ocasio cortez and jan schakowsky rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and rep jan schakowsky d il plan to introduce a

dividend income tax proposals michael bennet s and mitt romney s proposal to repeal stepped up basis sens michael bennet d colo and mitt romney r utah have proposed to repeal stepped up basis for investments that are passed to heirs at death subject to an exemption of 1 6 million for individuals and 3 7 million for married couples under current law the basis of property acquired from a decedent is stepped up to the fair market value at death with the result that appreciation in the property during the life of the decedent is not subject to income tax bennet and romney would repeal section 1014 as a result a taxpayer who acquires property from a decedent would receive that property with the decedent s tax basis and upon a sale of that property the taxpayer would pay tax based on the decedent s original tax basis the exemption of 1 6 million for individuals and 3 7 million for married couples is sometimes referred to as a sprinkle basis system similar to the system briefly in place in 2010 and would allow the executor of an estate to sprinkle additional basis to assets passing from a decedent joe biden former vice president joe biden would restore the top individual income tax rate to 39 6 from 37 would tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income 39 6 rather than 20 under current law for taxpayers who earn more than 1 million and would tax unrealized capital gains at death biden would also repeal the 10 000 cap on the state and local tax deduction but would limit the value of deductions for high income individuals to 28 finally biden would repeal the pass through deduction which allows certain income from flow through businesses to be taxable at a reduced effective rate of 29 6 biden would increase the corporate tax to 28 from 21 double the global intangible low taxed income gilti tax from 10 5 to 21 and from 13 125 to 26 250 starting in 2026 biden would also impose a 15 minimum tax on book income of companies that report net income of more than 100 million in the united states but paid zero or negative income tax biden estimates that his tax proposals will raise more than 3 4 trillion over ten years pete buttigieg pete buttigieg would restore the top individual income tax rate to 39 6 from 37 for the top 2 of taxpayers would tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income 39 6 rather than 20 under current law for the highest 1 of earners and would increase social security taxes for the top 2 of taxpayers he would also repeal the 20 pass through deduction and change the treatment of carried interest buttigieg would restore the corporate tax to 35 from 21 bernie sanders sanders has proposed to increase the individual marginal income tax rate as follows 40 from 37 on income between 250 000 and 500 000 45 on income between 500 000 and 2 million 50 on income between 2 million and 10 million 52 on income above 10 million sanders also proposes to cap itemized deductions at 28 for households making over 250 000 and to repeal the 20 pass through deduction sanders would also tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income for households making over 250 000 sanders proposes to restore the corporate tax rate to 35 from 21 currently treat large master limited and other partnerships as corporations for tax purposes eliminate expensing and accelerated depreciation for corporations so that investments are depreciated based on their economic life sanders would also limit the interest deductions of corporations to 20 of adjusted taxable income and tighten the related party rules sanders would also revise the international tax rules by taxing worldwide income at the u s corporate rate i e sanders would repeal the 10 5 gilti rate and apply a per country limit on foreign tax credits i e disallow cross crediting sanders would further restrict inversions by limiting interest deductions presumably only for inverted corporations to 105 of a u s corporation s share of net interest expense over worldwide income presumably based on the group s income sanders would also treat companies that are managed and controlled in the united states as domestic corporations and would drastically expand the definition of an inverted corporation to one owned by 50 of the same presumably u s shareholders after a merger sanders would retain the base erosion and anti abuse tax beat but increase the rate to 17 5 from 10 and exclude deductible payments that give rise to includable u s income he would repeal the reduced 13 125 tax rate for foreign derived intangible income fdii and deny u s foreign tax credits for excise tax payments by oil extractive gambling and other companies finally sanders would require corporations with revenues over 25 million to publicly disclose significant portions of their tax returns and country by country financial information elizabeth warren warren has several proposals to increase taxes on individuals and corporations that would raise revenue for her medicare for all plan first warren would restore the top individual income tax rate to 39 6 from 37 and restore the corporate tax rate to 35 from 21 in addition under warren s proposal foreign earnings would be subject to a country by country minimum tax at the same rate of 35 on a worldwide basis foreign corporations would also subject to u s tax based on their u s sales which would be equal to what they would have owed if they were subject to a country by country minimum tax warren would also eliminate immediate expensing of investments for corporations and require them to depreciate or amortize investments based on the investment s economic life warren has also proposed a 7 surtax on corporations with worldwide profits exceeding 100 million this new surtax would be separate from the existing corporate tax warren estimates that amazon would pay 698 million in taxes if the surtax was adopted amy klobuchar to finance her higher education plan sen amy klobuchar proposes raising taxes on capital gains and dividends for taxpayers in the two highest income tax brackets she would also impose a 30 minimum tax on people earning more than 1 million alexandria ocasio cortez and jan schakowsky ocasio cortez s and schakowsky s bill will would increase the top marginal individual income tax rate to 59 they estimate that when combined with federal payroll taxes and state and local taxes the effective income tax rate for taxpayers who earn over 10 million would be 70 this increase in individual income tax rate to 59 is estimated to raise about 2 trillion or more over a decade financial transaction tax proposals sanders warren and andrew yang have each proposed financial transaction taxes on trades of stocks bonds and derivatives sanders would apply a 0 5 tax for stocks a 0 1 tax for bonds and a 0 005 for derivatives and would provide an income tax credit to offset the financial transaction tax for taxpayers with income of less than 50 000 or 75 000 for couples sanders estimates that his proposal would raise over 2 4 trillion in revenue over 10 years yang has also proposed a 0 1 tax on financial transactions yang projects that this tax would raise 50 billion in revenue per year and would finance his freedom dividend warren would also impose a 0 1 tax on the sale of stocks bonds and derivatives that would be assessed and collected on financial firms warren estimates that this tax would generate over 800 billion in revenue between 2020 and 2029 proposals for additional taxes bernie sanders exorbitant ceo pay tax sanders has also proposed to impose additional taxes on corporations based on the ratio of its ceo s compensation and its median employees compensation his plan would apply to publicly and privately held companies with annual revenue of 100 million or more 0 5 between 50 and 100 to 1 1 for ratios between 100 and 200 to 1 2 for ratios between 200 and 300 to 1 3 for ratios between 300 and 400 to 1 4 for ratios between 400 and 500 to 1 5 for ratios over 500 to 1 sanders estimates that if median worker pay is increased to 60 000 a year and ceo pay is capped at 3 million no additional tax would result however if corporate behavior does not change sanders estimates that the proposal would generate an additional 150 billion in revenue over a decade this revenue would be used to pay for sanders proposal to eliminate medical debt elizabeth warren s social security tax warren has proposed a new 14 8 contribution requirement on annual earnings of 250 000 or 400 000 for joint filers split evenly between employers and employees she would also impose a separate 14 8 tax on net investment income of taxpayers who meet those thresholds the revenue would be used to fund the social security trust fund and permit current and future recipients of social security to receive an additional 200 in monthly benefits elizabeth warren s lobbying tax warren has proposed that companies and organizations that spend between 500 000 and 1 million a year on lobbying would pay a 35 tax on those expenditures lobbying expenditures over 1 million would be subject to a 60 tax and lobbying expenditures over 5 million would be subject to a 75 tax gift estate tax proposals cory booker booker also has proposed to restore the estate tax structure to 2009 levels and rates by lowering the threshold value of estates subject to the tax to 7 million for married taxpayers from the current 22 8 million threshold bernie sanders sanders would also reduce the threshold value of estates subject to estate tax to 7 million for married taxpayers in addition the existing flat 40 estate tax rate would be replaced with the following progressive rates 45 for the value of an estate between 3 5 million and 10 million 50 for the value of an estate between 10 million and 50 million 55 for the value of an estate in excess of 50 million an additional 10 surtax would apply to estate value in excess of 500 million 1 billion for married couples sanders also proposes to 1 change the rules for grantor retained annuity trusts grats and other types of trusts and valuation techniques and 2 increase existing protections for farmland and conservation discussion warren s and sanders wealth tax proposals each apply only to the wealthiest americans and have no effect on other taxpayers if the wealth tax proposals were enacted without changes to the income tax taxpayers subject to them who earn current income would be subject to both the income tax and the wealth tax with respect to that income however taxpayers who hold and do not sell appreciated assets would be subject only to the wealth tax thus the proposals retain the current disparate tax treatment between capital and labor also the wealth tax requires annual valuations and is subject to constitutional challenge on the other hand because the wealth tax generates revenue each year it is more likely to raise revenue even when faced with the possibility of repeal by a future congress buttigieg s and warren s mark to market taxes apply to the wealthiest 1 of individuals wyden s and booker s mark to market proposals would apply to fewer taxpayers than buttigieg s or warren s each of the proposals would impose tax on appreciated holdings but not on labor which is currently subject to current tax at the highest marginal rates thus the proposals generally equalize the tax treatment of labor and capital each of the mark to market proposals would be relatively easy to apply to publicly traded assets but would be more complicated to apply to non traded assets mark to market taxation is widely believed to be constitutional but still may be subject to challenge a look back regime or yield based tax for nontraded assets may raise less revenue if taxpayers anticipate that it will be repealed by a future congress and delay realization until after repeal andrew yang s vat would apply to all americans including low and middle income taxpayers although vats are generally regressive the regressive effect of yang s vat is offset somewhat by the use of the revenue to pay his freedom dividend the financial transaction taxes proposed by sanders warren and yang would fall disproportionately on the wealthy who have more financial assets but it would also be borne by foreigner taxpayers who hold about 20 of u s long term securities a financial transactions tax does not present significant valuation difficulties because the tax is imposed when the securities are sold or exchange it also would not face constitutional challenge however it could affect market liquidity and would be borne to some extent by the middle class biden s proposals are significantly less radical than the other candidates he would not impose a wealth tax or mark to market tax and instead would only impose realization upon death he would increase the corporate rate but only to 28 rather than 35 his 15 minimum tax is less severe than warren s 7 surtax and biden alone would repeal the 10 000 cap on the state and local tax deduction although he would also reduce the value of deductions to 28 for high income individuals the romney bennet proposal to repeal stepped up basis represents the most modest proposal it would end the current ability of taxpayers to entirely avoid income tax upon death but it would permit taxpayers to indefinitely defer paying tax on appreciated assets and exacerbate the lock in effect of the current realization system several candidates have proposed repeal of some or all of the tax cuts and jobs act this chart does not reflect those proposals elizabeth warren ending the stranglehold of healthcare costs on american families medium nov 1 2019 assets held anywhere in the world would be included in the net worth measurement including residences closely held businesses assets held in trust retirement assets assets held by minors and personal property with a value of 50 000 or more the estimate for sanders proposal is from emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman two economists at the university of california berkeley with whom both the sanders campaign consulted as he developed their proposals the estimate for warren s proposal is from simon johnson former chief economist for the international monetary fund betsey stevenson professor of economics and public policy at university of michigan and mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics see also note 2 these are estimates produced by emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman these thresholds would apply to both single and joint filers and would be indexed for inflation a taxpayer with income or assets that exceed either of the thresholds would be subject to the regime until the taxpayer fails to meet both income and asset requirements for three consecutive tax years at which point the taxpayer could elect out of anti deferral accounting opportunity and justice for workers cory 2020 laura davison alexandria ocasio cortez plans bill to boost

i have no details at this time but like yesterday s opening narrative i expect this to be the norm as we will be on heightened risk alert around possible rogue or proxy escalations given that the increased level of anti us sentiment is running thick amid iran s crescent of influence other than the widely expected announcement that a chinese trade delegate led by vice premier liu is heading washington to sign in to affect the p1 trade deal there hasn t been a great deal else for markets to feed off so today s critical payroll data comes as a most welcome distraction and will provide an essential update on the pace of us job gains with us economic growth mostly dependent on the consumer a healthy labor market is crucial to any constructive risk on narrative with the market backdrop remaining supportive namely improving macro central bank easing and receding tail risk around trade brexit and the middle east the path of least resistance remains up if truth be told i can t wait for this hectic week to end and i don t think i m alone in that view so traders will be excused if they decided to sit this one out electing to do little more their pre nfp position housekeeping chores

oil markets when things turn upside down they head south in a big way this week s additional piling on to the crude market was the eia inventory data showing a surprise build in oil and more substantial than expected builds in gasoline and distillates the compounding effects have been pretty gnarly for oil bulls over the past 48 hours and while it is challenging to quantify what if any residual risk premium is left priced into crude markets for political risk however given prices had retraced back to mid december levels overnight i think that infers that there is now very little risk premia left to sell off story continues the precedent of the attack on abqaiq in september was the template the market has chosen to model this week with low 70 s on brent capping out buying appetite and the initial price response reversing despite the lingering geopolitical effect likely to persist for a few months so with brent at 65 the market is probably not fully pricing in supply risk factors and with this risk skewed to the upside with the chance of proxy or rogue threat of disruption to physical supply still elevated we could see a floor start to build around current levels at the same time traders will now turn the focus back on the relatively pedestrian views around trade and data which remain positive for oil gold markets a key factor driving gold was the turnaround in oil as both commodities remain highly correlated to middle east geopolitical risk but for gold unlike oil markets a variety of underlying uncertainties around data trade the fed on hold narrative and even the lingering effects of the middle east fracas has cushioned further losses so far in addition with the house in gridlock president trump has two areas of policy control under the commander in chief powers trade and military policy so it could be wise to assume these areas will remain in the market s focus for some time and the uncertainty around these shifting dynamics given the president s mercurial nature will likely support gold for the time being with that said it might be worth keeping an eye on the new war powers measures legislation tabled by pelosi which would limit trump s power to take military action against iran however with a stronger usd surging equities and higher us yields greeting asia market this morning it makes for a compelling reason to sell not buy gold despite the fast money meltdown to 1541 oz on the back of a considerable risk on cross asset move yesterday s net flows were still into buying territory so it seems like the technical levels appear to be good contrarian entry points for gold bulls on the technical scrim look for 1550 oz pivot with 1530 the next primary level of support critical to that long gold view traders are keeping an eye on the us dollar which is currently being viewed as the global barometer of risk finally we could traders adopt a wait and see approach as the market pivots to tonight s critical nfp report currency markets fx flows this week have been characterized by risk on buying of usd one notable exception that i m a bit puzzled by is chf which is trading very bid as large flows are going through the market during european hours despite the risk on tone other than to suggest hedge funds view the franc as fair value at current levels and an excellent hedge against all the ills of the word i m a bit perplexed the euro and swiss franc none the less there has been a lot of interest in eurchf topside structures the feeling here is that since the swissy benefitted disproportionately from recent tensions in the middle east perhaps because japan s dependency on oil imports from the persian gulf c 85 made the yen an unreliable haven so as the middle east tensions de escalated the eurchf could fly on a more pronounced long chf unwind but it hasn t worked out that way so far the japanese yen long usdjpy has worked out well and i still don t see any reason not to play if from the long side the markets should remain in buy on dip mode with stop losses getting moved up to 108 50 now on the topside i expect a lot of two way interest to come in around 110 but it looks like a matter of time before we test it the australian dollar and the yuan if you were looking to get into the global growth for 2020 trade it could be worth looking at the divergence in cnh and aud as the aussie has been hammered over the past four days on bushfires and iran fears while the yuan has remained firm with the cnh likely to bounce after signing of the trade deal positively the aud shouldn t be that far behind and the correlation could play some significant catch up in the days ahead even more so with risk on lights flashing green the malaysian ringgit with regional risk sentiment improving and the us china trade deal still on course to be signed january 15 despite softer oil prices the ringgit will likely coattail the yuan positive skew into the p1 trade dea this article was written by stephen

interesting sessions i attended at last week s american economic association meeting was a panel titled making global markets work for american workers the discussion featuring economists dani rodrik kimberly clausing and josh bivens laid out the problems with free trade the shortcomings of u s trade policy during the past few decades and some suggestions for improvement but although the economists did a great job of critiquing the old free trade consensus there was no clear idea of what to replace it with economists still tend to strongly back trade liberalization but the cozy consensus in favor of removing trade barriers is eroding the experience of the china shock in which a sudden wave of import competition devastated the lives of many american manufacturing workers was a wake up call the bipartisan backlash against trade agreements which threatened to leave economists in the political wilderness was another economists such as rodrik and bivens who have criticized the free trade consensus for a long time are getting heard more while free trade defenders such as clausing are forging more nuanced arguments economists are starting to agree that free trade has two big weaknesses unfairness and politics ever since the time of david ricardo the 18th century economist who developed the idea of comparative advantage it has been well known that not everyone benefits when trade barriers fall if the u s is relatively good at making shoes and japan is relatively good at making blue jeans american jeans makers and japanese shoe companies have good reason to fear a trade agreement between the two countries this becomes especially dangerous when one country specializes in cheap labor bivens like many others suspects that this is what happened with china the addition of a billion workers to the global labor force was a bonanza for the rich who could buy cheaper consumer goods and a disaster for the middle class in developed nations as bivens noted the u s has gradually shifted toward trading with poorer and poorer countries good for global development but perilous for many american workers in the old days economists tended to address this problem by arguing that the winners from trade should compensate the losers but it s very hard to identify who won and who lost was a factory worker put out of a job by china by automation by bad corporate decisions by the decline of unions or the inevitable market shifts it s possible to simply increase redistributive taxation and clausing calls for this but government checks probably aren t a satisfying compensation for a steelworker who suddenly finds his career gone and his skills unwanted the second problem is that actual trade agreements tend to bear only a passing resemblance to the idealized notion of free trade in an economics textbook thanks to lobbying by business interests real trade agreements are tangles of rules and regulations that can restrain competition one well publicized example of this is the investor state dispute settlement isds system designed to shield intellectual property in international markets which has been roundly criticized as a way to protect corporate profits over the interests of local populations at the very least trade policy can be improved by increasing redistributive taxation and by removing corporate carve outs from trade agreements but there are a number of other problems with textbook free trade that those policies leave unaddressed for example bivens noted that trade agreements might weaken environmental and labor standards at the national level making it harder for producers in countries with tougher regulations to compete the advantages from trade might also be ephemeral a country that chooses to export natural resources and forsake manufacturing might have a gain in wealth in the short term but in the long term it could miss out on technological improvement and productivity gains economists are beginning to recognize these dangers but so far there are few credible suggestions for how to deal with them without forsaking the very real gains from international trade imposing unrealistic rich country labor standards on poor countries could hurt their development and trap them in poverty and industrial policy although spectacularly successful in some cases is very tricky to get right one thing that economists almost all agree on however is that tariffs are a bad response to the drawbacks of free trade serving mainly as a tax on domestic consumers they also invite retaliation causing more carnage but if not tariffs then what so far there s no clear answer my suggestion is export subsidies but this hasn t received much attention yet identifying the failings of free trade is a lot

global financial conditions have improved across the world although rising debt levels pose a future threat an uneasy cessation of trade hostilities between china and the united states provided some relief the bright spot in the global economy continues to be consumer spending global growth weakened considerably in 2019 as trade wars and weakening growth in china negatively impacted growth in many parts of the world the manufacturing sectors were either in recession or close to recession territory in response many central banks began to loosen monetary policy rather than tighten as had been expected a year ago with some countries notably china and the united states providing additional stimulus as well however the past month has seen some relief in the unrelentingly downbeat news on the global economy an uneasy cessation of trade hostilities between china and the united states the diminished risk of a no deal brexit and an ease in financial conditions as stimulus provided by central banks is beginning to filter through meanwhile as global exporters adjusted to the new world of higher tariffs the impacts of the trade war on real gdp growth turned out to be smaller than expected by the end of the year many of the ihs markit purchasing managers indexes especially in manufacturing began to stabilize and show small gains moreover while any major progress on the trade war will likely have to wait until after the 2020 us elections an escalation in hostilities significant enough to do major damage also seems unlikely the bright spot in the global economy continues to be consumer spending which is benefitting from decent income growth along with low oil prices inflation and interest rates in addition global financial conditions have improved across the world although rising debt levels pose a future threat all told ihs markit expects global growth to stabilize at 2 5 in 2020 before edging up in 2021 and 2022 what to expect for the global economy in 2020 the us economy will grow at trend around 2 we assess the trend or potential growth in the us economy to be around 2 real gdp growth was above trend from 2017 to 2019 thanks to fiscal stimulus however with the effects of this stimulus wearing off growth is returning to trend some special factors will boost gdp growth over the first half of next year the phase one trade deal with china will also help a little consumer spending roughly 70 of the economy will increase about 2 7 in 2020 putting a floor on growth in the broader economy on a calendar year basis we look for real gdp to expand 2 1 next year china s growth rate will fall below 6 while it is tempting to blame much of the recent slowdown on the us china trade war the decade long deceleration is the result of both structural and cyclical factors an ageing population and a sharp drop off in productivity growth mean that potential growth in china is lower now than a decade ago and is set to fall further since the global financial crisis 10 years ago china s debt as a percentage of gdp has surged to about 260 mostly due to a corporate borrowing binge and more recently an increase in household mortgage borrowing tying the hands of policymakers attempts to deleverage the economy by curbing the role of shadow banks have only been partially successful and have come at the expense of growth policymakers are currently engaged in a balancing act they would like to cut the debt ratio or at least keep it from rising while providing enough stimulus to keep growth from falling too fast ihs markit predicts that china s growth rate will slide even further to 5 7 in 2020 europe s economy will stabilize then recover slightly the slump in eurozone growth in 2019 was alarming nevertheless there are some signs that the worst may be over while the hard data are giving mixed signals weakness in the business sectors versus sustained growth in consumer spending the soft data are showing early signs of an inflection point in particular the ihs markit manufacturing pmis for the eurozone have picked up a little although service sector pmis have weakened ihs markit expects eurozone growth to stabilize at around 0 9 in 2020 before picking up a little in 2021 meanwhile the results of the uk election suggest that while the worst of the brexit uncertainty may be over there is still a hard slog ahead with growth dropping to 0 5 in 2020 before recovering slightly in 2021 japan s faltering growth will be cushioned by more stimulus japan s real gdp growth rate accelerated to an estimated 1 1 in 2019 however fourth quarter growth is expected to turn negative as a result of the increased sales tax at the beginning of october in response to the weakness driven by the sales tax hike along with the drag from trade and super typhoon hagibis the abe government announced a larger than expected 120 billion 15 month fiscal package the first since 2016 and the largest since 2012 the money intended to upgrade infrastructure invest in new technologies and repair typhoon damage will neutralize much of the negative effects of the sales tax hike consequently after falling to 0 3 in 2020 japanese real gdp growth is projected to recover in 2021 emerging markets will continue to tread water as debt reaches new peaks the past decade has not been kind to the emerging world as growth has fallen from an average 7 3 in 2010 to 4 2 in 2019 while the long slide in china s growth rate has been a key factor emerging markets also faced two other stiff headwinds lackluster expansions in the developed world and falling commodity prices

by hari kishan bengaluru jan 10 reuters the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behaviour during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favour of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market reuters poll u s dollar dominance polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson hari kishan thomsonreuters com 918067496546 the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc

it is almost a stylised fact that a crude oil price shock is an annual feature and this time it has struck at the beginning of the year the shock is always singular as it is caused more by geo political tensions with iran being the fulcrum of the controversy for some years now there was a time when opec could move prices given the oligopolistic power wielded by them but this is passé with american shale based oil entering the market and the us becoming one of the largest suppliers the power of opec has gone down to an extent the recent imbroglio in iran has led to the price of crude moving towards 70 barrel and stock markets getting into a tizzy with panic striking across the forex markets investors are searching for new havens and the non dollar currencies like euro and yen seem to have been preferred to begin with in such situations the logical thing to do is to wait and watch and see if the disturbance is temporary or permanent if it is the former then time would be the healer but if it is the latter there could be some implications for us as there is a lot of dependence on imports just how important is oil in indian economics the first thing that comes to mind is inflation as higher oil prices means higher fuel prices which with the exception of lpg and kerosene would be transmitted directly to the consumer the price of petrol and diesel have moved up immediately as there is no subsidy element and the pricing system is on a daily basis curiously at the macro level the wpi gets impacted more given the weight of these products in case of the wpi the weight of all crude related products is around 10 4 which means that 10 increase in crude price can potentially lead to 1 increase in wpi inflation and given that it is presently moving in the negative terrain the potential increase can make it positive in case of cpi the direct weight is lower at 2 4 and hence the inflation impact is moderate even though this would be affecting households directly this also means that rbi would be less concerned when looking at the monetary policy as the cpi effect would be less bothersome and the wpi effect not really relevant from the point of view of monetary policy oil is also important for the government on both the revenue and expenditure side on the expenditure side the subsidy level gets impacted and with the present targeted amount of rs 37 000 crore there would be an upside risk in case crude oil price remains high for a prolonged period of time therefore the fy21 budget would be watchful of this phenomenon as it would be drawn on the basis of an assumption of crude oil price which if higher than 65 barrel will enter the budgetary numbers a higher provision has to be made in case the government is keen to not let market prices increase for these products on the other side the higher crude price is good for the government as there is a lot of revenue to be earned the effective duty taxes levied on petrol works out to almost 100 while that on diesel is between 65 70 these duties are outside the ambit of the gst and consciously so as there is a lot of revenue to be earned by the government in fy19 the central government earned around rs 3 lakh crore and the state government around rs 2 3 lakh crore clearly such revenue would end in case these products came under the gst as the highest slab is 28 which is much below what is being levied today in fact even if the rate is fixed at say 67 for both the products this would not work well with the government as the ad valorem rate would mean lower collections in case crude oil prices declined therefore there is an incentive to keep these products out of the purview of gst it has always been defended on grounds that these products are essential to the consumption basket of the common man though diesel does enter the transportation costs of goods that are finally passed on the other direct impact is on the trade deficit crude oil has progressively become less important in the indian trade basket with this share now being less than 30 this is so because of various factors there has been a movement towards alternative fuels which though marginal today would expand cng has already caught on for vehicles in some metro cities second the slowdown in the economy has meant that there is less demand for fuels which is getting reflected in the declining share in the import basket third the lower demand for autos has meant that even in future there would not be exponential growth in consumption of oil products therefore crude oil is not as potent a factor in distorting the trade balance and hence current account and eventually the balance of payments position the oil intensity of growth across the globe has been coming down which in a way is a threat to the future of countries that are fully dependent on oil with the impact on trade deficit unlikely to be very stark the rupee should continue to move based on fundamentals which remain strong mainly due to the strong capital flows witnessed so far this year therefore the impact on the rupee should be muted to this extent however of late it has been observed that currencies move more due to sentiment and extraneous conditions of which the dollar as the pivot currency holds the clue as long as the strife signals play out the rupee would tend to get volatile though a fair value of 71 5 72 to the dollar looks more likely once normalcy returns however of late the dollar and its strength drives currencies and as the us exercises power there would be a tendency for the dollar to strengthen globally which results in currencies weakening across the globe this can be expected in the coming days too the oil crisis comes at a time when the indian economy is weathering a series of challenges stable oil prices were one of the assumptions of monetary policy which focused more on core inflation this will change as the price movement becomes more permanent in nature fiscal policy also has assumed stable prices within a range and would require some tweaking to factor in this new reality hence this episode of crude oil prices will be watched quite closely by policy makers as the implications go beyond the political overtones that are currently pervading the headlines the crux will be as to how long does this imbroglio last and whether it would spread to other neighbouring nations too prima facie it looks like being more transient in nature though one can never tell in such cases author is chief economist care ratings views are personal

economists at the world trade organisation wto anticipate global trade growth to be between 2 1 and 4 while they expect 2 4 growth for 2017 the unpredictable direction of the global economy in the near term and the lack of clarity about government action on monetary fiscal and trade policies raises the risk that trade activity will be stifled a spike in inflation leading to higher interest rates tighter fiscal policies and the imposition of measures to curtail trade could all undermine higher trade growth over the next two years weak international trade growth in the last few years largely reflects continuing weakness in the global economy trade has the potential to strengthen global growth if the movement of goods and supply of services across borders remains largely unfettered however if policymakers attempt to address job losses at home with severe restrictions on imports trade cannot help boost growth and may even constitute a drag on the recovery said wto director general roberto azevêdo although trade does cause some economic dislocation in certain communities its adverse effects should not be overstated nor should they obscure its benefits in terms of growth development and job creation we should see trade as part of the solution to economic difficulties not part of the problem in fact innovation automation and new technologies are responsible for roughly 80 of the manufacturing jobs that have been lost and no one questions that technological advances benefit most people most of the time the answer is therefore to pursue policies that reap the benefits from trade while also applying horizontal solutions to unemployment which embraces better education and training and social programmes that can quickly help get workers back on their feet and ready to compete for the jobs of the future he said the wto s more promising forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are predicated on certain assumptions and there is considerable downside risk that expansion will fall short of these estimates attaining these rates of growth depends to a large degree on global gdp expansion in line with forecasts of 2 7 this year and 2 8 next year while there are reasonable expectations that such growth could be achieved expansion along these lines would represent a significant improvement on the 2 3 gdp growth in 2016 in 2016 the weak trade growth of just 1 3 was partly due to cyclical factors as economic activity slowed across the board but it also reflected deeper structural changes in the relationship between trade and economic output the most trade intensive components of global demand were particularly weak last year as investment spending slumped in the united states and as china continued to rebalance its economy away from investment and toward consumption dampening import demand global economic growth has been unbalanced since the financial crisis but for the first time in several years all regions of the world economy should experience a synchronized upturn in 2017 this could reinforce growth and provide an additional boost to trade forward looking indicators including the wto s world trade outlook indicator point to stronger trade growth in the first half of 2017 but policy shocks could easily undermine positive recent trends unexpected inflation could force central banks to tighten monetary policy faster than they would like undercutting economic growth and trade in the short run other factors such as the uncertainty provoked by the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union could potentially have an effect meanwhile the possibility of a rise in the application of restrictive trade policies could affect demand and investment flows and cut economic growth over the medium to long term in light of these factors there is a significant risk that trade expansion in 2017 will fall into the lower end of the range the recovery of world trade this year and next is based on expected world real gdp growth at market exchange rates of 2 7 in 2017 and 2 8 in 2018 this gdp estimate assumes that developed economies maintain generally expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and that developing economies continue to emerge from their recent slowdown it should be noted that the wto does not produce its own gdp forecasts but rather uses consensus estimates based on a variety of sources including the international monetary fund the organization for economic cooperation and development and the united nations among others historically the volume of world merchandise trade has tended to grow about 1 5 times faster than world output although in the 1990s it grew more than twice as fast however since the financial crisis the ratio of trade growth to gdp growth has fallen to around 1 1 last year marked the first time since 2001 that this ratio has dropped below 1 to a ratio of 0 6 1 chart 1 the ratio is expected to partly recover in 2017 but it remains a cause for concern key points world merchandise trade volume is forecast to grow 2 4 in 2017 but due to a high level of uncertainty this is placed within a range of 1 8 3 6 this is up from a very weak 1 3 in 2016 as global gdp growth rises to 2 7 this year from 2 3 last year trade growth in 2018 should pick up slightly to between 2 1 4 0 the ratio of trade growth to gdp growth fell below 1 1 in 2016 for the first time since 2001 the slowdown in emerging market economies contributed much to the sluggish rate of trade growth in 2016 but these countries are expected to return to modest growth in 2017 export orders and container

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade related stories part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behavior during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favor of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market other stories from the global foreign exchange poll polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade related stories part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behavior during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favor of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market other stories from the global foreign exchange poll polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson

asian economies began 2020 with a brighter outlook and hopes for reversing fortunes amid a truce in last year s bruising us china trade war but the shock killing of top iranian military commander qassem soleimani by a us drone strike abruptly checked sentiment as markets weighed the new unforeseen risk of a possible us iran war global markets and oil prices have whipsawed in recent days on iran s retaliatory strike against american military bases in iraq and follow up conciliatory statements from us president donald trump and iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif signaling at least for now that the hostilities will not spiral into full blown war asian stock markets fell hardest on the us s initial attack while oil briefly surged above us 70 a barrel for the first time since the attack on oil facilities in saudi arabia last september but markets rallied and oil prices eased to around 65 per barrel when trump claimed on wednesday that iran was standing down after no americans were harmed in the targeting of us installations and iran s foreign ministry said the strikes concluded tehran s response to soleimani s assassination the indications from markets are that overall traders are taking this within their stride said matt simpson a senior market analyst at gain capital in singapore indeed market reaction to soleimani s killing was comparatively subdued compared with the iran backed yemeni rebel attacks of september 14 on saudi arabian oil facilities that briefly halted about 5 of global output causing us west texas intermediate wti futures to climb

that an actual supply disruption caused by a possible blockade of shipping lanes would send prices soaring and immediately impact asia s largest net energy importers including china south korea japan and singapore twenty one million barrels equivalent to about 21 of global petroleum liquid consumption are exported every day through the strait of hormuz considered to be the world s most important oil chokepoint just over three quarters of crude supplies that move through the narrow strategic waterway were shipped to asian markets in 2018 according to energy information administration eia estimates the largest importers of crude moved through the shipping route in 2018 were china india japan south korea and singapore if the channel which is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point were blocked by iran in a conflict scenario with the us that aimed to target american allies and their fuel supplies analysts believe crude prices could easily top 100 per barrel iran is not yet likely to court a full scale american attack by shutting down the strait of hormuz said matt gertken a geopolitical strategist at bca research a view widely held by traders and analysts it is more likely to retaliate via regional proxy attacks including cutting off oil production pipelines and shipping at a time of its choosing in a research note published after soleimani s killing gertken wrote that the trump administration may now feel emboldened by the rise of us shale oil production and decline in oil import dependency oil prices soared more than 4 on january 3 and equities reversed early gains following news that the us had killed a top iranian general photo afp frederic j brown indicators suggest that the world s largest economy is set to be a net petroleum exporter on an annualized basis for the first time in 2020 iran would have to sustain an oil supply cutoff as large as the abqaiq attack for four months in order to drive gasoline prices high enough to harm the us economy as a whole gertken wrote this buffer may have convinced trump he has plenty of room for maneuver in confronting iran major oil consumers including the us and china keep millions of barrels in strategic reserves to offset any major disruption in global crude supplies according to the international energy agency iea global crude production could near a surplus of 700 000 barrels a day in the first quarter of this year representing a comfortable supply cushion while market alarm has subsided with the us and iran stepping back from the brink there are certain expectations that simmering tensions could boil over again either through additional reprisals from tehran through regional proxy militias and cyber attacks or through further trump administration escalations as he seeks to gain an edge in a heated election season further escalation would wipe out any benefits of the interim us china trade deal and put the global economy on track for a recession said jeffrey halley senior market analyst for asia pacific at foreign exchange firm oanda in referring to an improved global demand outlook ahead of the signing of a phase one us china trade deal investors are likely to run aggressively for the exit door and move into gold and other precious metals if a further action reaction cycle pushes washington and tehran toward a declared war oil would of course surge along with a rise in the swiss franc japanese yen and us dollar emerging market stock markets and currencies would suffer a wholesale rush for the exit door halley predicts satellite image depicting strait of hormuz map nasa john karr director of operations at sophisticatedinvestor com believes the latest geopolitical crisis between the us and iran doesn t alone have the capability of destabilizing the global economy the increased tensions between the two nations will likely have a short lived impact on asian economies he told asia times unfortunately the signs appear to be pointing towards a global recession and this was prior to the emerging us iran geopolitical crisis uncertainties surrounding the us iran crisis could impact investor confidence until its resolution but ultimately this geopolitical situation will have minimal effect on the global economy at large karr said liam hunt a market analyst with the same investment portal said that all indications for now point toward de escalation in the unlikely event of sudden escalation between tehran and washington look out for widespread stock sell offs wti crude oil futures to jump above 75 per barrel and 10 year treasury

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade related stories part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behavior during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favor of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market other stories from the global foreign exchange poll polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson

a good place fed vice chair richard clarida said the us economy begins 2020 in a good place pce price inflation is running somewhat below the 2 target but fed projects that inflation will rise gradually back to the 2 symmetric objective meanwhile there is no evidence that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost push pressure on price inflation over the course of 2019 fomc shifted the monetary stance to offset some significant global growth headwinds and global disinflationary pressures such shift was well timed and has helped keep the outlook on track as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate monetary policy is not on a preset course he added if developments emerge that in the future trigger a material reassessment of our outlook we will respond accordingly fed officials are comfortable with rates at current level comments from fed officials yesterday generally suggested that interest rates are currently at the right place there won t be further rate cut unless outlook worsens materially st louis fed president james bullard said that the current 2020 baseline outlook suggests reasonable chance of soft landing while growth is expected to slow us is not facing a sharper than anticipated collapse the three rate cuts in 2019 were a substantial move now we should wait and see what the effects are in the first half of 2020 and beyond that minneapolis fed president neel kashkari said that trade tensions with china don t seem to be increasing so that s a positive that could translate into more business investment he added that fed s rate cuts have taken some of the recession risk off the table we think inflation is around the corner and then inflation doesn t come because we raise rates prematurely he said now that we re in a pause mode i think we re in a much better position chicago fed president charles evans said i see the fundamentals as pretty good if something were to happen that caused the economy to slow down and perhaps do worse than that then that would call for some type of response on the downward fashion but i m not expecting that dallas fed president robert kaplan said federal funds rate at 1 50 1 75 is a roughly appropriate setting gdp is expected to grow about 2 to 2 25 this year and if anything my growth outlook has firmed a bit in the last several weeks he also backed the view that rates should stay at current level unless there is material change in the outlook nfp to guide dollar s rebound

moscow january 10 tass the us iran standoff may contribute to the strengthening of the russian currency experts interviewed by tass suggest nevertheless the influence of the situation on the world s emerging markets and the overall global economy remains debatable and dependent on various scenarios of events unfolding in the future the us launched a strike on baghdad s airport on january 3 killing iran s quds force commander qasem soleimani early on january 8 it was reported that tehran retaliated by launching a missile barrage on us facilities in iraq the escalation of the us iran conflict pushed the price of oil up due to potential us strikes on iranian oil facilities as well as the price of gold due to mounting geopolitical risks experts interviewed by tass believe that oil prices may soar above 70 per barrel which in its turn may become the reason for the russian currency to strengthen what experts are predicting for the russian market bcs premier senior analyst sergey suverov thinks that a spike in the oil price is likely to bolster the russian ruble however any further intensification of the conflict could drive investors away from risky assets the influence on the ruble s exchange rate is contradictory on the one hand the dollar as the main global currency rises amid geopolitical uncertainty but on the other hand a spike in the oil price fuels the ruble s strengthening the conflict s development and its escalation jeopardize stock markets and is fraught with investors withdrawing from risky assets particularly from emerging markets he explained the escalating mideast tensions may put pressure on the oil supply sending commodities prices higher and bolstering the ruble s exchange rate in the short term vasilisa baranova an analyst with the acra analytical credit rating agency suggests however that effect is likely to be moderate due to regular forex purchases by the russian finance ministry which reduce the dependency of the ruble s exchange rate on oil price fluctuations she noted baranova also pointed out that the shift by investors to higher quality assets while a simultaneous decline in demand for the riskier assets of developing markets including the ruble will weaken it in its base case scenario acra expects the average annual exchange rate of the ruble at around 66 67 rubles per dollar in 2020 finam s sergei drozdov suggests that the ruble will hardly respond to the oil price hike or the middle east conflict whereas russian stocks will continue hitting all time highs regarding both the moex and rts indices such surges will not affect the russian economy overall oil price hikes will be positive for russia s budget though they will be quick and minor he explained the investment guru assumes that it is difficult so far to predict in which direction the ruble s exchange rate will move against the dollar however the ruble s exchange rate may rise to 63 64 rubles should adverse developments on stock markets emerge drozdov said adding though that he does not rule out that the russian currency will strengthen further to 60 61 rubles due to the current consolidation us iran strife and its effect on the global economy the conflict is unlikely to have any influence on the global economy at this stage the incident looks local and unlikely to unfold adversely in the future even western experts say that it will most likely shift to the diplomatic level moreover 2020 marks the of the american presidential race so us president donald trump is unlikely to rush into a war with iran the risks are far too great drozdov stressed on the other hand the deterioration of us relations with iran is still unsurprising he added the us president needed to distract attention from the impeachment america has always traditionally dodged domestic problems by creating trouble spots somewhere globally most recently in the middle east previously it happened during the 2008 crisis as the us escalated friction with iraq and libya to divert attention from its economy he noted the expert added that in case of any further escalation the oil price might breach the 71 per barrel mark which will be gradually neutralized similar to the situation with the drones attacking the infrastructure of saudi arabia in september 2019 tass meanwhile sergey suverov from bcs expects the possibility of an oil price hike above 70 per barrel would trigger global inflation and bring the world economy closer to recession thereby boosting stagflation risks in the us senior manager at the ncr rating agency alexander proklov shares the view that the key question today is how far the us iran conflict will go and how long it will last nevertheless the expert does not expect the short term crisis in the middle east to have a major effect on the global economy
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade related stories part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behavior during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favor of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market other stories from the global foreign exchange poll polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson

everyone and happy new year we finished 2019 strong with fourth quarter results that reflected solid demand for our product as homebuyers continue to prioritize choice and personalization in their home buying decisions in addition our performance under our returns focused growth plan produced measurable results most notably in the year over year expansion of our housing gross profit margin with the conclusion of the third year of this plan there are several achievements to highlight first at roughly 270 million our net income in 2019 is up by over 150 relative to 2016 when we launched the plan this helped drive our return on equity to 12 2 nearly doubling its 2016 level to a point that was solidly within the plan s target range next the significant cash from operations that we generated in the past three years enabled us to invest over 5 billion in land acquisition and development as well as return 73 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while also repaying about 850 million in debt as a result we worked our debt to capital ratio down considerably to 42 3 from 60 5 also achieving our tightened target goal and reduced our interest incurred meaningfully benefiting our gross margin with the success of our plan we are a larger higher margin more profitable and less leveraged company going forward our strategy will remain consistent with a continued focus on profitably expanding our scale while increasing returns specific to the quarter we produced total revenues of 1 6 billion and diluted earnings per share of 1 31 housing revenues were up 15 year over year despite falling a bit short of our anticipated range as some of our deliveries in the bay area were delayed due to the fires and power shutdowns which impacted our ability to get utilities installed nonetheless we leveraged the higher revenue base to meaningfully expand our operating income margin which was up a full percentage point year over year to 10 7 excluding inventory related charges this translated to an increase in profitability per unit of approximately 10 over 42 000 in operating income per home the key driver of our operating margin growth was our robust gross margin which we expanded 120 basis points as compared to the prior year to just shy of 20 we opened 23 new communities during the quarter contributing to 9 growth in our average community count in 2020 we continue to anticipate another step up in our average community count with nearly all of the openings coming from higher margin core communities the composition of our portfolio continues to strengthen with core communities expected to represent more than 90 of our average count this year from a macro perspective mortgage interest rates remain low continuing to support favorable market conditions characterized by steady economic expansion solid job growth high consumer confidence and positive demographic trends while these factors fueled strong demand supply continued to be insufficient to meet homebuyers needs with resale inventory declining of 3 7 months supply in november and even lower at the affordable price points where we operate in the quarter our absorption pace accelerated to 3 7 monthly net orders per community this was our highest fourth quarter pace in more than a decade in spite of increasing prices in about 65 of our communities during the quarter a seasonally significant level of pricing power taken together our community count growth and increased absorption pace as well as a soft comparison in last year s fourth quarter all contributed to producing a 38 gain in our net orders net order value expanded by 43 in the fourth quarter to 1 1 billion contributing to a 26 rise in our year end backlog value to 1 8 billion in terms of units our backlog grew to over 5 000 homes our highest fourth quarter level in a number of years we continue to strategically invest in land and position our product offerings to be attainable for the median household income in each submarket as a result we cater primarily to first time as well as first move up buyers in the fourth quarter our delivery is the first time buyers rose to 56 of our total the highest share of this segment that we have generated in many years our ability to increase our profitability at the lower first time buyer price points is both a core competency and competitive strength that has been the foundation of our more than six decades in homebuilding we ve been consistent in our approach and as housing markets continue their measured recovery fueled by first time buyer demand we believe we are solidly positioned in the sweet spot of the market while we continue to capitalize on this demand underlying the progression in our financial metrics is a stronger and more efficient business our build times were down 12 days year over year in the fourth quarter an 8 improvement to 131 days our implementation of our built to order model is highly efficient as working from a large backlog of homes enables cost synergies and an even flow production process we also like the flexibility that built to order provides a year ago as interest rates and home prices were rising challenging affordability we rotated lower in square footage in most cases using standard plans from our product series we enhanced our product lineup thereby expanding the choices available to buyers by offering smaller homes with similar livability and room count and reposition our model parks to reflect these changes where possible while the subsequent fall in interest rates moderated affordability pressures we believe we are well positioned for the future regardless of the rate environment moreover we found that the steps we took were aligned with consumers preferences as our square footage on built to order homes was down about 100 feet year over year in the fourth quarter at the same time our studio revenue per home was higher as buyers opted for less square footage without compromising the features they value our initiative was successful in widening our demand pool without sacrificing gross margin in addition to the efficiency in our homebuilding operations our mortgage banking joint venture kbhs continues to mature with a capture rate growing sequentially throughout each quarter of 2019 ending at 74 in the fourth quarter kbhs originated 70 of our homebuyers mortgages for the full year as a result our deliveries are more predictable with higher customer satisfaction and the jv produced a 67 increase in income versus the prior year we expect the capture rate to improve further in 2020 which should result in greater customer satisfaction and an increase in our jv income with respect to the market updates i will now highlight a couple of regions beginning with the west coast this region continued to demonstrate momentum in the fourth quarter producing a 54 increase in net orders with a positive comparison in ffd california division growth in both community count and absorption pace contributed to the region s results as market conditions were generally favorable across the state our bay area communities delivered a particularly robust comparison reflecting in part to softness in the prior year s quarter as well as our ongoing and intentional shift to more affordable price points looking ahead we expect our west coast region to further expand its community count in 2020 our central region produced its highest fourth quarter net orders in more than a decade at over 1 000 a year over year increase of 41 market conditions in austin were especially strong fueled by significant in migration in response to job growth and home price affordability we opened five new communities in the second half of 2019 in our austin division in premier locations accessible to key employers transportation routes and lifestyle amenities in the area these openings contributed to the division s near doubling of its net orders year over year one community in particular willow trace produced outstanding net order results at well above company average margins the success of this community lies in providing an appealing product in the prime north austin tech corridor that is affordably priced with respect to the area s median household income in alignment with our company strategy of note many of our buyers already rented in the area and the opening of this community allowed them to remain in their preferred location while now becoming homeowners with an asp in austin of 295 000 we are competitively well positioned relative to the 315 000 median price of a resale home strong market conditions have continued in december and early january sustaining solid demand for our products while we typically provide an update on quarter to date net orders on this call the comparison is skewed during this period due to the softer market conditions across our industry during the same period a year ago as a result we will instead provide our net order outlook for our first quarter of 2020 we believe a reasonable range is net order growth between 15 and 25 on community count growth of roughly 5 in closing we ended 2019 strong and are off to a productive start in this new year with a 1 8 billion backlog and an improving community mix we are poised for double digit growth in our revenue this year also in anticipating higher profitability we see further opportunity for expansion of our return on equity which we expect to grow meaningfully in 2020 given our favorable positioning and healthy market conditions we are anticipating a solid year ahead and we look forward to updating you as the year unfolds with that i ll now turn the call over to jeff for the financial review jeff jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jeff and good afternoon everyone i will now cover highlights of our financial and operational performance for the 2019 fourth quarter as well as provide our outlook for the 2020 first quarter and full year we are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance we generated improvements in virtually all of our key profitability measures and achieved solid absorptions and community count growth which contributed to a significant year over year increase in backlog value during the quarter we also increased the borrowing capacity of our unsecured revolving credit facility and successfully refinanced our march 2020 senior note maturity in the fourth quarter our housing revenues were up 15 from a year ago to 1 5 billion due to a 16 increase in homes delivered that was partially offset by a slight decline in the overall average selling price looking to the 2020 first quarter we expect to generate housing revenues in the range of 910 million to 970 million up 18 at the midpoint over the same period of 2019 for the 2020 full year we still anticipate housing revenues in the range of 4 9 billion to 5 3 billion having ended our 2019 fiscal year with a backlog value of approximately 1 8 billion up 26 from a year ago we believe we are well positioned to achieve these expectations in the fourth quarter our overall average selling price of homes delivered declined slightly to 392 500 primarily due to a shift in mix in our west coast region toward lower priced communities within our bay area operations for the 2020 first quarter we are projecting an overall average selling price of approximately 375 000 we believe our overall average selling price for the 2020 full year will be in the range of 380 000 to 400 000 homebuilding operating income for the fourth quarter increased 33 to 162 5 million compared to 121 9 million for the year earlier quarter including total inventory related charges of 4 1 million in the 2019 quarter and 9 1 million a year ago our homebuilding operating income margin was 10 5 up 140 basis points from the 2018 fourth quarter excluding inventory related charges from both periods our operating margin was 10 7 for the current quarter and 9 7 for the year earlier quarter for the 2020 first quarter we anticipate our homebuilding operating income margin excluding the impact of any inventory related charges will be in the range of 4 9 to 5 3 up 80 basis points at the midpoint over the same period of the prior year for the 2020 full year we expect this metric to be in the range of 7 9 to 8 5 an improvement of 50 basis points at the midpoint over the prior year our 2019 fourth quarter housing gross profit margin improved 150 basis points to 19 6 including inventory related charges excluding the impact of these charges our gross margin for the quarter increased by 120 basis points to 19 9 compared to 18 7 for the prior year quarter this improvement reflected the continued reduction in our outstanding debt along with growth in our unit deliveries enabling us to further lower our incurred interest per delivery in the fourth quarter to under 3 of housing revenues with the lower levels of prior period incurred interest and the widening value spread between our active inventory and total debt we have measurably reduced our amortization of previously capitalized interest which favorably impacted our housing gross profit margin by 90 basis points for the 2019 fourth quarter in addition to the year over year improvement generated from the lower amortization of interest our housing gross margin was favorably impacted by both our adoption of asc 606 and the reduced headwind of deliveries from reactivated communities partially offset by a mix shift of homes delivered from certain west coast region communities with relatively high average selling prices and gross margins assuming no inventory related charges we are forecasting a housing gross profit margin for the 2020 first quarter in a range of 17 8 to 18 2 up 40 basis points at the midpoint over the same period of the prior year compared to our fourth quarter results this range reflects the anticipated seasonal first quarter decrease in operating leverage from lower revenues we expect our 2020 full year gross margin excluding inventory related charges to be in the range of 18 7 to 19 3 an improvement of 30 basis points at the midpoint over the prior year our selling general and administrative expense ratio of 9 1 for the fourth quarter was up 10 basis points from last year s fourth quarter ratio mainly as a result of the unfavorable impact of the adoption of asc 606 partly offset by improved operating leverage from higher housing revenues we are forecasting our 2020 first quarter sg a expense ratio to be in the range of 12 7 to 13 1 as we continued to prioritize containment of overhead costs and expect to realize favorable leverage impacts from higher housing revenues in the current year period we also anticipate that our 2020 full year sg a expense ratio will be in the range of 10 5 to 11 1 our income tax expense of 41 8 million for the fourth quarter was essentially a noncash expense due to our deferred tax assets and represented an effective tax rate of approximately 25 our deferred tax asset balance of 364 million at year end was down more than 77 million from the prior year we currently expect our effective tax rate for the 2020 first quarter to be approximately 20 and for the full year to be approximately 23 due to our remaining deferred tax assets we anticipate that for both periods this will continue to represent a noncash expense in december federal legislation was enacted which among other things extended the availability of energy tax credits for building energy efficient homes through december 31 2020 reflective of our industry leadership in sustainable homebuilding and energy efficiency the extension of the tax credits will favorably impact our 2020 effective tax rate the estimated favorable impacts from this recently enacted legislation is included in the first quarter and full year tax rate estimates including a charge for the early extinguishment of debt our net income for the quarter was up 27 year over year to 123 million and diluted earnings per share increased to 1 31 up 36 as compared to the year earlier quarter this strong level of fourth quarter net income contributed to a 12 2 return on equity for the full year we expect to realize an improvement in excess of 100 basis points in this metric in 2020 we ended the year with stockholders equity of 2 38 billion as compared to 2 09 billion at the end of the prior year and our book value per share increased by 11 to 26 60 turning now to community count our fourth quarter average of 253 was up 9 from 232 in the corresponding 2018 quarter primarily reflecting a 28 increase in our west coast region we ended the year with 251 communities up 5 from a year ago of the 251 communities 25 communities or 10 were previously classified as land held for future development compared to 34 or 14 at the end of 2018 on a year over year basis we anticipate our 2020 first quarter average community count will be up in the mid single digit range for the 2020 full year we expect growth in our average community count in the low to mid single digit range more importantly in addition to this positive trajectory we anticipate continued improvement in the quality of our community portfolio in 2020 we expect growth in our core community count to drive a lower percentage mix of communities previously classified as land held for future development which we believe will provide a tailwind for future gross margin improvement during the fourth quarter to drive future community openings we invested 399 million in land and land development with 147 million or 37 of the total representing land acquisitions moving on to our balance sheet there are several areas of continued improvement that clearly reflect the successful implementation of our returns focused growth plan in achieving our capital allocation and efficiency objectives these include measurably growing our total inventory investment while reducing our inactive inventory substantially deleveraging our capital structure and meaningfully expanding the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility i will now cover these achievements in more detail in 2019 we invested 1 6 billion in land acquisitions and development and generated 251 million of net operating cash flow we also reduced our inactive inventory to 150 million at year end or just 4 of our total inventory starting this quarter we have elected to include lots under contract with refundable deposits in our total lot count as of year end 59 of the approximately 65 000 lots in our pipeline were owned and 41 were under contract including about 9 200 lots under contract with refundable deposits our own lots at the end of the year represented about a 3 2 year supply based on homes delivered in 2019 during the quarter we raised approximately 300 million from a public offering of 4 8 senior notes maturing in 2029 and used the net proceeds along with available cash to retire all 350 million of our 8 senior notes that were scheduled to mature on march 15 2020 this early extinguishment of debt resulted in a fourth quarter charge of 6 8 million due to the impacts of the lower interest rate and decreased amount of debt outstanding the successful fourth quarter completion of these transactions will lower interest incurred in 2020 by nearly 14 million in addition these transactions extended the weighted average life of our senior notes from 2 2 to 4 9 years earlier in the year we repaid all 230 million of convertible senior notes at the maturity in february resulting in an 8 4 million reduction in our diluted share count and contributing to a reduction of more than 300 million and our total outstanding debt at year end as compared to the prior year our deleveraging activities over the past 12 months combined with the increase in our equity from strong 2019 earnings drove a 740 basis point improvement in our year end debt to capital ratio to 42 3 we expect further improvement resulting from stockholders equity accretion in 2020 and forecast our debt to capital ratio to be below 40 by the end of the year during the quarter as part of our efforts to improve our capital efficiency and enhance liquidity we completed an amendment to our unsecured revolving credit facility increasing its borrowing capacity to 800 million from 500 million and extending its maturity by more than two years to october 2023 we ended the year with 454 million of cash and total liquidity of over 1 2 billion including availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolver at the end of the year in 2020 we plan to further execute on the principles of our returns focused growth strategy our priorities remain expanding our revenues within our served markets improving our operating margin monetizing our deferred tax assets reducing our leverage increasing returns and enhancing long term stockholder value we will now take your questions please open the lines questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of alan ratner with zelman associates please proceed with your question alan ratner zelman and associates analyst hey guys good afternoon congrats on another very strong quarter into the year you know i think obviously the order number very impressive we ve been seeing some big numbers recently out of the other builders as well i m just curious as we head here in the spring selling season how does the supply side of the business seem right now just thinking about all the various things that have been constrained at various points in the cycle labor land it doesn t seem like there s too much concern out there as far as an ability to get these homes built and delivered and kind of maintain a strong absorption pace for 2020 but i m just curious what you guys are seeing on the ground related to all of those various inputs jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer alan a few things we already own and control all the lots for 2020 and we re very deep into 21 and working on that as jeff just guided we expect revenue growth this year so we own the lots to support a nice growth trajectory in 20 and we re working on 21 in terms of input cost the land is it s tight out there but it s rational and we re able to invest just like we did in the fourth quarter to support our goals on the direct side it s pretty flat right now for us lumber came way down labor is fairly rational we re working on growing our scale in our markets to retain all the great relationships we have with our trade partners on the ground so direct cost flat land s tight but we re finding it and we re pretty comfortable with being able to support our growth goals alan ratner zelman and associates analyst great that s really good to hear and helpful second thank you for providing the order guide for 1q obviously that helps with the modeling off of a tough comp period from a year ago as you move past the first quarter and just thinking about the interplay between community count and absorption right now right now it seems like everything is kind of clicking on all cylinders you ve got margin lift you ve got absorption growth but how much from here is it reasonable to expect your ability to drive absorption higher i mean right now you guys are probably the highest in the industry from an absolute standpoint so is there an expectation that maybe absorptions flatline a little bit once you get past the easy comps and maybe more of the upside might be on price and margin or should i think about that more even in terms of where that upside might come from if the market stays strong jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer good question and it s one we spend time on every week in here alan as we shared in our comments our fourth quarter pace was the highest we ve seen for fourth quarter in over a decade so sales pace is strong and demand is strong we continue to toggle it in every community every week where we re optimizing the pace versus the price to get the highest return on the asset it wouldn t surprise me if sales ticked up incrementally because of the strong market conditions but our focus is going to be more on getting margin as opposed to pushing a higher sales pace in the short run until we get to our margin goals if we get to our margin goals then you d see us go back for more pace but for now it d be hold rate to maybe go up a little and focus more on lifting our margins operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman patterson wells fargo securities analyst good evening guys nice results first just wanted to talk about your capital structure and the potential tailwinds of the lower interest expense your net debt to total capital has declined nicely in the past couple of years it s a net kind of 35 how do you think about your correct capital structure going into kind of 2020 2021 any chance that you actually work that down kind of below 30 jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer well we have a target out there relating to our gross debt to capital of 35 to 45 and i would say that the target remains relevant for us and something we re focused on but we had forecasted at the end of the third quarter that we d be down within that range by the end of this year which we have accomplished we do believe that we ll be able to be below 40 by the end of 2020 and comfortably within that range and i d say our capital priorities remain the same as they have been with the only slight difference is in 2020 we believe more of that improvement on the leverage ratio will come from equity accretion as opposed to debt reduction but we re really focused on growing the business and reinvesting in the business as a primary use of capital we ll continue to maintain our now higher level of dividend and we ll opportunistically work that leverage ratios we have chances to do so truman patterson wells fargo securities analyst ok ok and then a couple of questions on california you know very strong demand but have you actually seen the higher price point coastal areas really start to heal or improve at all and then california s 2020 solar mandate could you give us an update on that whether you ll eat some of the cost and it possibly impacts margins do you see this possibly stalling the construction cycle given potential installation labor constraints anything you can really discuss about the solar initiative jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer sure truman first on the markets we re seeing a minor improvement i ll say at the higher price points along the coast the lower price points are showing strong demand higher up to get in price the softer it gets it s better than it was in the fall but it s still not back if you go to the oc houses in 2 5 million 3 million are still a little soft out there but overall there are more affordable price points the demand is very strong right now in the state which is in part why we rotate it down again in our product positioning to cater to where the demand is relative to solar it s a good question it s still playing out and the industry is trying to get its arms around it as a company i m not sure if this group is aware of it but we ve been the largest provider of solar homes in the state we ve now delivered over 10 000 solar homes so we get it and we know how to do it and there s a different story in every community in some communities were grandfathered other communities we have permits we ve already have in place to avoid the solar mandate where you get past the those types of nuances though the consumer has a choice you can either lease the system or we can include it in the price order of magnitude if they lease it the payment is around 50 a month it s not a crazy number you can t say with certainty it s not going to affect demand in some way because it is 50 you could otherwise put toward a house payment but as we get our arms around it we think it s more of an incremental thing than some significant shift in demand or supply out there no concerns right now on our ability to install the solar because we ve been doing it for so long and we have great partners out there operator our next question comes from the line of stephen kim with evercore isi please proceed with your question stephen kim evercore isi analyst thanks very much guys and again let me add my congratulations for the quarter i wanted to ask you about the land spend in the quarter if i could this quarter your land spend was pretty modest and your yearly spend declined i believe on a year over year basis and so i was curious as to given the growth outlook that you ve laid out for 2020 what kind of land spend do you think we should expect in 2020 do you think you could see yet another decline or do you think that you re going to see in order to sort of maintain the growth that you ve outlined here you re going to need to see your land spend pick up in dollars jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer stephen the good news is we have the dry powder to do whatever we want to pursue our growth we were down a little bit in 19 versus 18 but if you get into the numbers that down can be one or two deals in california it s not a broad based decline in land spend and some of it is timing some of it is structure we re working toward controlling more owning less that influenced the number a little bit but our plan right now and our hope is that for 20 we d spend more than we did in 19 because we want to fuel a growth trajectory and that s the way our plan is laid out right now stephen kim evercore isi analyst got it ok that s helpful and last quarter i believe you said two things and i wanted to sort of see whether or not your thoughts had changed or if things have changed at all in the last three months last quarter i believe you said you raised prices in 90 of your communities how did that look this quarter and then i think you also mentioned that you really weren t interested in the build to rent model and that s one of those themes that seems to be continuing to attract a lot of folks so curious to see whether or not your thoughts have evolved there jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer stephen i shared in the prepared comments that we raised prices in about 65 of our communities which for a fourth quarter is pretty good stephen kim evercore isi analyst yes did you say 65 jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer it shows that there is power in the quarter yes 6 5 stephen kim evercore isi analyst ok got it jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer and then on the rent our view right now is we re homebuilders anytime we ve analyzed this we get a better return on the asset as a homebuilder than we would as a landlord and until we get to a growth trajectory that we re struggling with i think we ll stay focused on what we do well it doesn t mean we don t look at it there could be an opportunity if we have a multiproduct asset we want to acquire where a portion of it could be for rent and we d figure it out but it s not a primary initiative for us at this time operator our next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst thanks for taking my questions i had a two part question related to gross margins first and jeff k just on the amortized interest and also the percentage of deliveries expected from reactivated communities in 20 versus 19 could you provide us an update on how you re looking at those two metrics with respect to the 2020 numbers jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer sure mike we believe both of those will remain tailwinds to our gross margin next year perhaps at a slightly reduced level i mean in 2019 we had 90 basis points of improvement coming from interest amortization i do believe it will be less than that next year and the same thing with the reactivated headwind that should reduce but probably not by as much as what we ve been seeing in for example in the fourth quarter we were down 50 basis points year over year in the reactivated but we re kind of getting to the end of the story on that i think we still have some upside coming from continuing to sell out and close out those communities but there s probably less opportunity but still both nice tailwinds for us on gross margin next year both are included in our guidance metrics in addition to all the change in mix etc in our community portfolio for next year and i think more good news to come from both those areas mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst ok that s helpful and then the second question is then related as well which is those seem to be tailwinds and your margin guidance the midpoint is up 30 basis points with those as tailwinds on the market conditions that you re speaking to it seems like that s a kind of conservative number to be up 30 basis points at the midpoint on gross margins so maybe you could give us some of the other puts and takes that you re thinking about whether it s mix related or labor inflation or directs any additional color would be helpful jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer sure the largest impact and largest factor for us in 2020 would just be the community mix change we closed over 100 communities out in 2019 it was over 40 of our beginning community count so the community portfolio is quite a bit different as we go into next year we re trying to forecast gross margins coming off those communities many of which have not been opened yet so we have a lot of openings to occur still in the first half of 2020 that will generate revenues and margins in the back half of the year so we re trying to do the best job we can anticipating and forecasting where those margins will be at this point we have pretty good visibility as i think most people are aware with our large backlog to the first half of the year and very critical spring selling season that s coming up where we ll be refining our estimates and expectations for the full year and speaking of the spring i mean we re pretty excited about it we think we re really well positioned as a company probably best positioning we ve had in quite some time relative to the market and combined with very strong market conditions right now we re really optimistic about the spring and we ll be updating those gross margin metrics and expectations as we go through the year like we always do every quarter but right now right at the midpoint we re at about 19 for the year up and our operating margins were up about 50 basis points year over year at the midpoint of our operating margin guidance so pretty nice improvement on a base of right around 5 billion of top line revenue so we re excited about what that will do to the bottom line operator our next question comes from the line of matthew bouley with barclays please proceed with your question christina chiu barclays analyst hi this is actually christina chiu on for matt my first question is just on your community count growth expectations for 2020 specifically geographically are there any markets or price points that you re specifically focused on in 2020 jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer well what we re trying to do with community count is we try to grow the business throughout we don t constrain our divisions we don t constrain our regions at all with budgets and you can only spend so much on land if they re hitting our hurdles and they re bringing good land deals to the table that s how we go forward with it what we saw in 2019 which will impact 2020 revenues is we saw an outsize increase in our west coast region with our community count growth as well as our southwest region which has been a very strong market for us and a little more modest improvement flattish actually in central and a little more modest improvement in the southeast so those factors will impact 2020 top line a lot more than what we do with the 2020 count but as always we re trying to focus on opening as many communities as we can that are hitting our hurdle rates we re staying very disciplined on the hurdle rate side we ll continue with the company s strategy of focus on first time and first move up buyers it also happens to be really quite a bit of the strength of the markets in that area right now so we re right in the sweet spot and intend to continue to manage the business in that fashion christina chiu barclays analyst ok got it and then can you quantify or maybe give a timing update of how you re expecting sg a leverage in 2020 in light of accelerating revenue growth and coupled with moderating community count growth jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer right basically on the sg a side i mean we always hit kind of a high point is a negative high sg a ratio in the first quarter as our revenues are typically lowest in the first quarter and it progresses as we go through the year usually hitting out a low point in the fourth quarter and we expect pretty much the same trend that we ve seen in prior years in 2020 operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut with jp morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst yes hi thanks thanks very much i wanted to spend the first question just on the gross margin just trying to dig in a little better and maybe kind of rephrase or ask around some of mike s earlier questions in terms of fiscal 20 guidance you had as you said 90 bps of interest expense amortization improvement in 19 you expect further improvement in 20 although at a lesser rate so even if it s half of that amount you could still be looking at your core gross margins excluding interest flat to down a little bit so i just want to understand why you would think that if i think you kind of pointed earlier toward actually a continued improvement of mix of your communities from a gross margins standpoint you re coming off of an easier comp at least in the first half from perhaps higher incentives in the marketplace from the back half of 2018 and by contrast also i mean you ve and i think what people are just trying to understand is is there s just a basic level of cushion or conservatism that you re baking in given your four quarters now averaging 50 60 70 bps higher gross margin than at least our estimates and i m sure many on the street in terms of what you ve been able to beat so just trying to we re just trying to also reconcile and connect the dots or the drivers for next year jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer the basis of our guidance is really a roll up rate from the community level to the division level from the division level to the region and region of the company so it s very much a detailed forecast the mix impact is huge like i mentioned earlier over 40 of our communities are changing on a year over year basis you don t have the same communities that you re selling out of you re dealing with things like land cost inflation and trying to offset that with some of the new land parcels and we basically forecast based on what we know today so we base our forecast on our backlog gross margins as well as our selling gross margins and anticipating what those line gross margins would be later in the year as i mentioned earlier we re not even to this critical spring selling season yet so we don t have anything on the books really for the third and fourth quarters so it s all on paper right now and it s our best estimate as we see it and i think what s underappreciated generally by folks outside of the industry are trying to folks like you guys trying to come up with your own guidance or your own estimates for companies is the impact that mix can have and how much community changeover can impact the numbers and it s not just simple math of price up costs down and the other it s different store count in different stores it s different markets and the mix has a big piece of it so at this point in time we re that midpoint guidance number of 19 is kind of what we re seeing we do believe with the right market conditions in the spring that we could potentially do better than that that s why we have a range around it and right now we ll stick to the guidance numbers and update you as we go through the year michael rehaut j p morgan analyst jeff i appreciate that and obviously as you said to your point mix can be a pretty big driver in terms of variation maybe just flipping to this past fourth quarter in an effort maybe to better understand your guidance versus actual results your gross margin for the fourth quarter came in 40 bps above the high end of your guidance range 70 bps above the midpoint so i m just curious if you had a sense of what drove that difference relative to your expectations or relative to the guidance range jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer the two largest items are really we did a little bit better in the amortization than we thought we were expecting something more similar to the third quarter we were about 20 basis points ahead of the third quarter and our amortization and really one of the largest drivers was the reactivated headwind was much lower than it s been pretty much in for years i think we picked up 50 basis points relative to the third quarter and reduced headwind from our reactivated communities and that was a function of two things one revenues were a lower percentage of the total but also i think importantly the reactivated communities actually had a pretty strong gross margin performance in the quarter and lifted the gross margins as jeff had mentioned we increased prices in about two thirds of our communities during the quarter but then the other thing that s usually outside of our guidance is we have a certain percentage of spec sales and deliveries within the quarter which obviously don t start off in our backlog and we end up forecasting those and to the extent you could take price in the quarter and you have to take less of a discount on our spec sales that was also a positive so those three factors are probably the main things behind the margin beat operator our next question comes from the line of susan maklari with goldman sachs please proceed with your question susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good afternoon my first question is just on you noted in your commentary that you ve seen buyers increase their spend in the design centers even as the size of the home has come down modestly i guess can you just give us a little more color on what you re seeing there and maybe how you re thinking about that coming through and especially maybe in the margin and then some of that mix as we think about 2020 jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer susan understanding it you d have to look at what each buyer is picking one buyer will pick up higher level of upgrade cabinet a different buyer will pick some more cabin option or debt option or a structural option it really when you look at the data it really reinforces how personalized the homes are that we produce because there are no two that are the same what s interesting for me is the studio spend goes up while the home goes down and a lot of the cost in the studio are tied to the size of the home so it tells you that even the buyer that was buying a larger home had the ability to put things in their house and chose not to and with a little bit smaller home apparently they re choosing to put more in the studio so we and we price in the studio it s accretive to margin to a degree it s not a big lift to margin it s just more revenue at our normalized margin for the most part so as we model we have a margin analysis per community that includes studio revenue based on our experience at that community or with that price point in that city so it s all baked into our guidance we don t we don t look to the studio right now as another upside for the year it s just part of the asp and the revenue that we guided susan maklari goldman sachs analyst sure i was just trying to get a sense of are you seeing more of a lift as the size of the house has shrunk and should is that something that generally could kind of continue as you get this move to more smaller homes jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer it could it could i bet literally and you ve been to our studios every buyer is different than some want a big home with nothing in it and others want a smaller home and load everything in it and everything in between and that s a part of why we sell so well because we can cater to everybody operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question our next question comes from the line of jay mccanless and he will be our final question from wedbush please proceed with your question jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst good afternoon thank you for fitting me in the first question i had a small decline in orders in the southeast this quarter could you talk about what was going on there because that part of the world has had a pretty good run in the past few quarters in terms of order growth hello jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer no no we re looking at the notes jay one of the things that happened last year in the fourth quarter we had acquired that builder in jacksonville landon and had a bunch of inventory that we sold through so there was a spike in sales in jacksonville that didn t replicate because it s getting out of old product that we weren t going forward with so that s probably some of it the numbers aren t that big our business in the major cities is very good the orlando jacks tampa and raleigh we re seeing good demand in all of them so i think it was just the timing of that acquisition jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst and then the other question i had could you all quantify how many closings were pushed because of the fire and i m sorry to hear that you were affected by the fire but how many closings were pushed and are those pushed closings having any impact on your assumptions for the 1q 20 gross margin jeff mezger chairman president and chief executive officer no it s a pretty modest impact it was well under 100 units but they re a high asp so it had a bit more of an impact on the revenues but it wasn t terribly significant and it held our full year revenues in about the same range as we were at at the end of last quarter so not a huge impact operator duration 57 minutes call participants jill peters senior vice president

by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behavior during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year advertisement advertisement this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine advertisement advertisement we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing story continues in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favor of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch advertisement advertisement the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac advertisement advertisement over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank advertisement advertisement not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market other stories from the global foreign exchange poll polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson
